### [1] [Local Timescale Gates for Timescale-Robust Continual Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12843)
*Ansh Tiwari,Ayush Chauhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LT-Gate脉冲神经元模型，通过双时间尺度动态和自适应门控机制解决SNN在持续学习中的稳定性和可塑性困境，显著提升时序分类任务的准确率和记忆保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在神经形态硬件上具有能效优势，但在需要快速适应和长期记忆的持续学习任务中存在困难，特别是稳定性和可塑性之间的平衡问题。

Method: LT-Gate模型让每个脉冲神经元并行跟踪快慢两个时间尺度的信息，通过学习的门控机制局部调整它们的影响，并引入方差跟踪正则化来稳定放电活动。

Result: 在时序分类基准测试中达到约51%的最终准确率，优于Hebbian持续学习基线的约46%和现有SNN方法，且无需外部重放或昂贵的正交化操作。

Conclusion: 多时间尺度门控能显著增强SNN的持续学习能力，缩小脉冲网络与传统深度网络在终身学习任务上的差距，并与神经形态硬件（如Intel Loihi芯片）完全兼容。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient artificial
intelligence on neuromorphic hardware but struggle with tasks requiring both
fast adaptation and long-term memory, especially in continual learning. We
propose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual
time-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron
tracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned
gate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to
preserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals,
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a
variance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by
biological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved
accuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal
classification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared
to about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower
for prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or
expensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully
compatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of
Intel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for
on-chip learning. Our results demonstrate that multi-timescale gating can
substantially enhance continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the gap between
spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks.

### [2] [Lifting Manifolds to Mitigate Pseudo-Alignment in LLM4TS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12847)
*Liangwei Nathan Zheng,Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLM4TS模型中的伪对齐问题，发现其源于预训练LLM的锥效应与时间序列数据低维流形的相互作用，并提出TimeSUP方法通过增加时间序列流形维度来缓解该问题，显著提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪对齐是LLM4TS模型普遍面临的挑战，导致其性能不如线性模型或随机初始化骨干网络，但社区对此问题的原因讨论有限。

Method: 提出TimeSUP技术，通过增加时间序列流形维度使其更接近语言嵌入的内在维度，让模型能清晰区分时间信号同时捕捉跨模态共享结构。

Result: TimeSUP在长期预测性能上持续优于最先进的LLM4TS方法和其他轻量级基线，并能无缝集成到四个现有LLM4TS流程中带来显著改进。

Conclusion: TimeSUP通过调整时间序列流形维度有效缓解伪对齐问题，使模型在统一嵌入空间中保持各模态独特特征的同时学习其共性。

Abstract: Pseudo-Alignment is a pervasive challenge in many large language models for
time series (LLM4TS) models, often causing them to underperform compared to
linear models or randomly initialised backbones. However, there is limited
discussion in the community for the reasons that pseudo-alignment occurs. In
this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of
pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the
cone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the
interplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically
low-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce
\textit{\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue
and improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches. TimeSUP
addresses this by increasing the time series manifold to more closely match the
intrinsic dimension of language embeddings, allowing the model to distinguish
temporal signals clearly while still capturing shared structures across
modalities. As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain
distinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model
preserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a
unified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term
forecasting performance. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into four
existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements in forecasting
performance.

### [3] [FedGTEA: Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12927)
*Haolin Li,Hoda Bidkhori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedGTEA是一个联邦类增量学习框架，通过高斯任务嵌入和对齐来捕获任务特定知识，在保持通信效率的同时缓解遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中的类增量学习问题，需要同时处理统计异构性、数据不确定性和隐私约束，同时确保在长任务序列中的可扩展性。

Method: 客户端使用基数无关任务编码器(CATE)生成高斯分布的任务嵌入，服务器端使用2-Wasserstein距离测量任务间差距并制定Wasserstein损失来增强任务分离。

Result: 在多个流行数据集上的实验表明，FedGTEA实现了优越的分类性能，显著缓解了遗忘问题，并持续优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGTEA通过概率化任务嵌入和对齐，为联邦类增量学习提供了一个可扩展、通信高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning,
called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is
designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable
and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the
Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task
embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and
quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size
regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task
sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to
measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the
Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic
formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves
task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings,
aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive
empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves
superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting,
consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.

### [4] [Learning at the Speed of Physics: Equilibrium Propagation on Oscillator Ising Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12934)
*Alex Gower*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文展示了在振荡器伊辛机(OIMs)上实现平衡传播(EP)的方法，将优化和采样统一到单一能量景观中，在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上获得竞争性准确率，同时保持对硬件约束的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用自然执行能量下降的物理系统来加速机器学习，特别是通过振荡器伊辛机(OIMs)的GHz频率动态来模拟基于能量的模型(EBMs)优化和梯度下降，同时内在噪声对应朗之万动力学，支持采样和优化。

Method: 在振荡器伊辛机(OIMs)上实现平衡传播(EP)，将优化和采样过程统一到单一总能量景观中，实现无需全局反向传播的局部学习规则。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到约97.2±0.1%的准确率，在Fashion-MNIST数据集上达到约88.0±0.1%的准确率，且在参数量化和相位噪声等实际硬件约束下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 振荡器伊辛机(OIMs)是快速、节能的神经形态学习基底，基于能量的模型(EBMs)可以在直接执行其优化的物理硬件上实现实际应用。

Abstract: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route
to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify
this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of
energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while
intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well
as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into
descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules
without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive
accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on
Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware
constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results
establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning,
and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may
find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform
their optimization.

### [5] [Pruning Cannot Hurt Robustness: Certified Trade-offs in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12939)
*James Pedley,Benjamin Etheridge,Stephen J. Roberts,Francesco Quinzan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次为状态对抗马尔可夫决策过程中的剪枝认证鲁棒性建立了理论框架，证明了剪枝只会增强策略的鲁棒性，并通过实验发现适度稀疏度下存在性能-鲁棒性的最佳平衡点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中部署的强化学习策略需要在对抗扰动下保持可靠性，而现代深度强化学习智能体的过度参数化带来了成本和脆弱性问题。虽然剪枝在监督学习中已被证明能提高鲁棒性，但其在对抗强化学习中的作用尚不清楚。

Method: 开发了状态对抗MDP中剪枝认证鲁棒性的理论框架，证明了高斯和分类策略中逐元素剪枝只会收紧鲁棒性边界。提出了三项目标分解方法，分离了清洁任务性能、剪枝引起的性能损失和鲁棒性增益。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，剪枝在适度稀疏度下始终发现可重现的"最佳点"，鲁棒性显著提高，同时不损害甚至有时增强清洁性能。

Conclusion: 剪枝不仅是压缩工具，更是实现鲁棒强化学习的结构性干预手段，揭示了性能与鲁棒性之间的基本权衡边界。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must
remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep
RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.
While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its
role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first
theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in
state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and
categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise
pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the
policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret
decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced
performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental
performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and
micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong
policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers
reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness
improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean
performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool
but as a structural intervention for robust RL.

### [6] [An Investigation of Memorization Risk in Healthcare Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12950)
*Sana Tonekaboni,Lena Stempfle,Adibvafa Fallahpour,Walter Gerych,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一套黑盒评估测试来评估基于结构化电子健康记录训练的基础模型中的隐私相关记忆风险，包括嵌入层和生成层的记忆探测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在大型去标识化电子健康记录上的训练具有临床应用潜力，但其记忆患者信息的能力引发了重要的隐私担忧。

Method: 开发了黑盒评估框架，包括在嵌入层和生成层探测记忆的方法，旨在区分模型泛化和有害记忆，特别关注易受伤害亚组的隐私风险。

Result: 在公开可用的电子健康记录基础模型上验证了该方法，并发布了开源工具包以促进医疗AI中可重现和协作的隐私评估。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估医疗基础模型中的隐私记忆风险提供了系统框架，有助于识别和减轻患者隐私泄露风险，特别是对易受伤害群体的保护。

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale de-identified electronic health
records (EHRs) hold promise for clinical applications. However, their capacity
to memorize patient information raises important privacy concerns. In this
work, we introduce a suite of black-box evaluation tests to assess
privacy-related memorization risks in foundation models trained on structured
EHR data. Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the
embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model
generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We
contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient
privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a
publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to
facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

### [7] [A Multimodal XAI Framework for Trustworthy CNNs and Bias Detection in Deep Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12957)
*Noor Islam S. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态可解释AI框架，通过注意力增强特征融合、Grad-CAM++局部解释和揭示-修正反馈循环来检测和缓解偏见，在MNIST多模态扩展数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基准数据集如MNIST往往无法暴露潜在偏见和多模态特征复杂性，限制了深度神经网络在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 统一了注意力增强特征融合、基于Grad-CAM++的局部解释以及用于偏见检测和缓解的揭示-修正反馈循环。

Result: 在MNIST多模态扩展数据集上达到93.2%分类准确率、91.6% F1分数和78.1%解释保真度，优于单模态和非可解释基线方法。

Conclusion: 将可解释性与偏见感知学习相结合增强了鲁棒性和人类对齐，为敏感领域中可信AI提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Standard benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, often fail to expose latent
biases and multimodal feature complexities, limiting the trustworthiness of
deep neural networks in high-stakes applications. We propose a novel multimodal
Explainable AI (XAI) framework that unifies attention-augmented feature fusion,
Grad-CAM++-based local explanations, and a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop for
bias detection and mitigation. Evaluated on multimodal extensions of MNIST, our
approach achieves 93.2% classification accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1%
explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI), outperforming unimodal and non-explainable
baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that integrating interpretability with
bias-aware learning enhances robustness and human alignment. Our work bridges
the gap between performance, transparency, and fairness, highlighting a
practical pathway for trustworthy AI in sensitive domains.

### [8] [Time-Varying Optimization for Streaming Data Via Temporal Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13052)
*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi,Erik G. Larsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究基于权重的时间变化优化问题，分析了统一权重和折扣权重两种策略在梯度下降下的跟踪误差性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化理论处理固定目标函数，但实际动态环境需要时间变化优化方法。本文从流数据学习角度出发，研究如何通过权重策略处理时间变化目标函数。

Method: 引入基于权重的结构化公式，分别研究统一权重（平等对待所有样本）和折扣权重（几何衰减旧数据影响）两种策略，分析它们在梯度下降更新下的跟踪误差。

Result: 统一权重策略下跟踪误差以O(1/t)速率渐近消失；折扣权重策略会产生非零误差下限，由折扣因子和每时间步梯度更新次数控制。

Conclusion: 不同权重策略在时间变化优化中具有不同的跟踪误差特性，为流数据学习提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective
functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important
subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the
problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization
lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a
structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the
streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,
an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data
samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,
which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which
geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive
tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between
the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under
gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE
vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas
discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount
factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our
theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

### [9] [Balancing Performance and Reject Inclusion: A Novel Confident Inlier Extrapolation Framework for Credit Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12967)
*Athyrson Machado Ribeiro,Marcos Medeiros Raimundo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的置信内点外推框架CI-EX来解决信用评分中的拒绝推断问题，通过迭代识别被拒客户样本分布并基于监督分类模型概率分配标签，在保持AUC竞争力的同时显著提升了拒绝推断特定指标的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝推断方法假设被拒客户行为可以从已接受客户中推断，但忽视了两个群体之间可能存在的分布差异，导致盲目外推问题。

Method: CI-EX框架迭代使用异常检测模型识别被拒客户样本分布，并基于监督分类模型概率为最接近已接受群体分布的被拒个体分配标签。

Result: 在两个大型真实世界信用数据集上的实验表明，CI-EX在拒绝推断特定指标上持续优于现有方法，同时在大多数实验中保持AUC的竞争力。

Conclusion: 拒绝推断方法通常需要在AUC和拒绝推断特定指标之间权衡，但提出的CI-EX框架在拒绝推断特定指标上表现优异，同时维持了AUC的竞争性能。

Abstract: Reject Inference (RI) methods aim to address sample bias by inferring missing
repayment data for rejected credit applicants. Traditional approaches often
assume that the behavior of rejected clients can be extrapolated from accepted
clients, despite potential distributional differences between the two
populations. To mitigate this blind extrapolation, we propose a novel Confident
Inlier Extrapolation framework (CI-EX). CI-EX iteratively identifies the
distribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and
assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the
accepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised
classification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated
through experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics
such as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area
under the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed
framework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics.
However, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI
models from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while
maintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.

### [10] [Achieving Logarithmic Regret in KL-Regularized Zero-Sum Markov Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13060)
*Anupam Nayak,Tong Yang,Osman Yagan,Gauri Joshi,Yuejie Chi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了KL正则化在博弈论环境中的理论优势，提出了OMG和SOMG算法，在矩阵博弈和马尔可夫博弈中实现了与KL正则化强度β相关的对数级遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管KL正则化在强化学习中广泛使用，特别是在对齐任务中取得了显著经验成功，但其在博弈论环境中的理论优势仍不清楚。

Method: 提出了OMG算法（用于矩阵博弈）和SOMG算法（用于马尔可夫博弈），基于最佳响应采样和乐观奖励机制。

Result: 两种算法都实现了与β相关的对数级遗憾，以及标准的√T遗憾，显著提高了样本效率。

Conclusion: KL正则化在博弈论环境中确实能提供理论上的样本效率优势，特别是在强正则化条件下。

Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to
a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to
preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote
exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization).
Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted
as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the
context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL
regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving
notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the
theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain
poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that
provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study
both two-player zero-sum Matrix games and Markov games: for Matrix games, we
propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic
bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which
also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic
bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales
inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the
standard $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret independent of $\beta$
which is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings

*Eric Yeats,Aaron Jacobson,Darryl Hannan,Yiran Jia,Timothy Doster,Henry Kvinge,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用去噪分数匹配损失作为局部内在维度(LID)的估计器，该方法比现有方法更高效且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LID估计方法需要多次前向传播或梯度计算，在计算和内存受限的场景中应用受限。

Method: 通过理论分析证明LID是去噪分数匹配损失的下界，并利用隐式分数匹配损失与FLIPD估计器的关系来估计LID。

Result: 在流形基准测试和Stable Diffusion 3.5上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和内存占用方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 去噪分数匹配损失是一种高效且可扩展的LID估计器，特别适用于大规模和高量化级别的问题。

Abstract: The local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data is a fundamental quantity in
signal processing and learning theory, but quantifying the LID of
high-dimensional, complex data has been a historically challenging task. Recent
works have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the
spectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their
density estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can
accurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the
diffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in
compute- and memory-constrained scenarios.
  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss,
motivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator.
Moreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also
approximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent
LID estimator, FLIPD. Our experiments on a manifold benchmark and with Stable
Diffusion 3.5 indicate that the denoising score matching loss is a highly
competitive and scalable LID estimator, achieving superior accuracy and memory
footprint under increasing problem size and quantization level.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过随机批次方法研究连续时间模型中的dropout正则化，构建了无偏估计器，建立了轨迹级和分布级的收敛性分析，并在训练过程中分析了最优控制和梯度下降的偏差，最终在单层神经ODE上验证了理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究连续时间模型中dropout正则化的理论基础，通过随机批次方法降低计算成本，同时保持正则化效果。

Method: 使用随机批次方法构建无偏估计器，在时间间隔上采样神经元批次，建立轨迹级收敛性分析和分布级稳定性分析，并进行Pontryagin伴随分析。

Result: 实现了轨迹级线性收敛率，分布级总变差误差为h^{1/2}，在训练中控制了最优成本和梯度的偏差，并在实验中观察到预测的收敛率和正则化效果。

Conclusion: 该方法在连续时间模型中有效实现了dropout正则化，具有理论保证和实际优势，包括良好的运行时间和内存特性。

Abstract: We study dropout regularization in continuous-time models through the lens of
random-batch methods -- a family of stochastic sampling schemes originally
devised to reduce the computational cost of interacting particle systems. We
construct an unbiased, well-posed estimator that mimics dropout by sampling
neuron batches over time intervals of length $h$. Trajectory-wise convergence
is established with linear rate in $h$ for the expected uniform error. At the
distribution level, we establish stability for the associated continuity
equation, with total-variation error of order $h^{1/2}$ under mild moment
assumptions. During training with fixed batch sampling across epochs, a
Pontryagin-based adjoint analysis bounds deviations in the optimal cost and
control, as well as in gradient-descent iterates. On the design side, we
compare convergence rates for canonical batch sampling schemes, recover
standard Bernoulli dropout as a special case, and derive a cost--accuracy
trade-off yielding a closed-form optimal $h$. We then specialize to a
single-layer neural ODE and validate the theory on classification and flow
matching, observing the predicted rates, regularization effects, and favorable
runtime and memory profiles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了FADE度量方法，通过比较未学习模型和参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来评估分布相似性，解决了现有遗忘度量方法的系统性盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型的遗忘度量基于参考响应或分类器输出，而非评估核心目标：遗忘模型是否与从未见过不需要数据的模型行为无法区分。这种参考特定方法存在系统性盲点。

Method: 提出功能性对齐分布等价(FADE)度量，通过比较未学习模型和参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来测量分布相似性，捕捉整个输出分布的功能对齐。

Result: 在TOFU和UnlearnCanvas基准测试中，传统度量方法接近最优的方法未能实现分布等价，许多模型在遗忘后反而与黄金标准更远。

Conclusion: FADE为开发和评估真正有效的遗忘方法提供了更稳健的基础，揭示了当前评估实践的根本差距。

Abstract: Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on
reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core
objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model
that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates
systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining
unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We
address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional
Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity
between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood
assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire
output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning.
Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas
benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods
achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve
distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold
standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in
current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust
foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.

In particular, the transformation associated with rejection sampling algorithms

Result: 在TDD场景中88.9%和FDD场景中43.8%的情况下优于基线模型，计算量比最强基线LLM4CP减少5倍和3倍，同时发布包含30万样本的CSI-RRG基准数据集。

Conclusion: CSI-4CAST在CSI预测中实现了优越的精度和计算效率，建立的CSI-RRG基准为深度学习模型在鲁棒性和泛化能力评估提供了标准化平台。

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for
ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While
deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and
statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical
non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and
computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep
learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional
neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and
Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in
CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a
comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization
testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic
scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel
models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise
types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves
superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost,
outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario,
the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and
3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over
CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect
the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the
dataset (https://huggingface.co/CSI-4CAST) and evaluation protocols
(https://github.com/AI4OPT/CSI-4CAST) are publicly released to establish a
standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and
efficient CSI prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Frank-Wolfe算法的LLM剪枝方法，通过凸松弛解决组合优化问题，显著降低了逐层剪枝误差，在GPT架构上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM剪枝方法使用贪婪启发式算法，忽略了权重交互作用，导致次优解。本文旨在通过数学优化方法找到更好的剪枝掩码。

Method: 将剪枝的组合约束进行凸松弛，使用Frank-Wolfe算法求解，然后将松弛解舍入为整数解。

Result: 该方法大幅减少了逐层剪枝误差，在GPT架构上优于强基线方法，且保持内存效率。

Conclusion: Frank-Wolfe算法结合凸松弛为LLM剪枝提供了理论保证的有效解决方案，能够近似求解原始组合问题。

Abstract: Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements
of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model
to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the
per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full
retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However,
finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it
to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics
that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we
instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and
solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method
drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines
on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide
theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence
guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the
original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to
integrality.

*Binxin Gao,Jingjun Han*

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ExtremBench基准数据集，用于评估LLM在数学极值问题上的推理能力，发现现有数学基准无法全面评估LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM推理能力的来源和机制，特别是优化推理能力，这在规划、控制和资源分配等关键应用中具有基础性作用。

Method: 构建ExtremBench数据集，包含93个标准化极值求解问题，源自中国数学奥林匹克不等式练习，并对多个开源模型家族进行广泛评估。

Result: 发现LLM的极值求解推理能力与当前数学基准（如AIME25和MATH-500）的评估结果不一致，有些模型在一般数学推理上表现强但在极值求解上表现差，反之亦然。

Conclusion: 现有基准可能无法全面捕捉数学推理能力的全谱，揭示了当前评估实践中的关键差距。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 刚性系统的时间积分是燃烧、高超声速等反应输运系统中的主要计算成本来源，需要开发能够缓解刚度挑战的策略。

Method: 开发了AMORE框架，包含多输出预测算子和自适应损失函数，设计了自动满足单位分割的trunk结构，提出了可逆解析映射来精确执行质量分数约束，采用两步训练方法。

Result: 在合成气（12状态）和GRI-Mech 3.0（54个状态中的24个活跃状态）两个示例中验证了模型的有效性和适用性。

Conclusion: AMORE是一个通用框架，提出的DeepONet将成为未来CFD研究的基础，用于加速湍流燃烧模拟。

Abstract: Time integration of stiff systems is a primary source of computational cost
in combustion, hypersonics, and other reactive transport systems. This
stiffness can introduce time scales significantly smaller than those associated
with other physical processes, requiring extremely small time steps in explicit
schemes or computationally intensive implicit methods. Consequently, strategies
to alleviate challenges posed by stiffness are important. While neural
operators (DeepONets) can act as surrogates for stiff kinetics, a reliable
operator learning strategy is required to appropriately account for differences
in the error between output variables and samples. Here, we develop AMORE,
Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator
capable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring
reliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states
from given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within
the framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize
the loss function. We designed the trunk to automatically satisfy Partition of
Unity. To enforce unity mass-fraction constraint exactly, we propose an
invertible analytical map that transforms the $n$-dimensional species
mass-fraction vector into an ($n-1$)-dimensional space, where DeepONet training
is performed. We consider two-step training for DeepONet for multiple outputs
and extend adaptive loss functions for trunk and branch training. We
demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of our models through two examples:
the syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states out of 54). The
proposed DeepONet will be a backbone for future CFD studies to accelerate
turbulent combustion simulations. AMORE is a general framework, and here, in
addition to DeepONet, we also demonstrate it for FNO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多阶段强化学习算法，用于单细胞扰动建模，通过自然梯度更新和PPO优化来避免局部最优，提高扰动预测的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法在细胞命运决策的非凸Waddington景观中容易陷入局部最优，导致轨迹陷入虚假谱系或不合理的分化结果，需要设计良好的初始化来逃逸局部最优。

Method: 多阶段强化学习算法：第一阶段使用Fisher向量积和共轭梯度求解器计算显式自然梯度更新，通过KL信任域约束提供安全的曲率感知初始策略；第二阶段应用带裁剪代理的近端策略优化(PPO)，利用小批量效率优化策略。

Result: 该方法在单细胞RNA测序(scRNA-seq)和单细胞ATAC测序(scATAC-seq)扰动分析中显著提高了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的多阶段强化学习初始化方法能够有效避免局部最优，收敛到正确的细胞谱系，为单细胞扰动建模提供了改进的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a
central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have
advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically
conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However,
these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of
cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in
spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable
gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design
frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet,
an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to
escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this
work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for
single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural
gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver,
scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the
first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we
then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped
surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We
demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing
(scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.

Conclusion: 提出的工作流成功解决了焊缝检测中的数据稀缺和信号干扰问题，实现了工业环境下可靠的自动化检测。

Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training
data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity
simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings
(resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end
machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e.,
industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the
challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow
consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution
alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order
Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive
dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively
inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion
models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set
of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD)
real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions,
i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution
representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed
by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end
solution for automated weld inspection on real data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息论的Koopman学习框架，通过平衡简化和表达能力来解决传统方法中潜在空间崩溃的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Koopman算子的无限维特性使得寻找合适的有限维子空间具有挑战性，特别是在深度架构中。现有方法在表示学习中存在简化和表达能力之间的平衡问题。

Method: 提出信息论拉格朗日公式，结合潜在互信息（促进简化）和冯·诺依曼熵（防止模式崩溃、鼓励多样性），设计新算法平衡这一权衡。

Result: 在多种动力系统上验证了方法的有效性，相比现有Koopman学习方法表现出更好的性能，学习到的表示更稳定且可解释。

Conclusion: 通过信息论视角重新思考Koopman学习，提出的框架成功平衡了简化和表达能力，为动力系统建模提供了更优的表示学习方法。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical
systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community.
However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable
finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We
argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning,
where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This
tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:
constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.
Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent
mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may
cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast,
expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such
collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an
information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this
tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian
formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a
stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative
evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our
representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical
predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of
dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman
learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率操作模型存在持续偏差，特别是在模拟极端事件和统计分布方面，而理想化模型虽然能精确校准特定特征，但不同模型之间存在学科壁垒。

Method: 利用重构的潜在数据同化技术，将不同复杂度的模型层次连接起来，特别适合利用理想化模型的稀疏输出，构建桥接模型。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提供了物理洞察力，还实现了计算效率，为物理辅助数字孪生和不确定性量化提供了有效工具，同时强调了推进理想化模型发展和建模社区间交流的重要性。

Abstract: Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system.
While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they
exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and
statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate
fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in
characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different
models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an
explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model
hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely
suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting
bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of
operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through
targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI
provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box
correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally
efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and
uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly
correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni\~no spatiotemporal patterns,
leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. This work also highlights
the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing
communication between modeling communities.

introduces controlled noise to the gradients during the optimization process.
Comparative experiments of this research are conducted on the CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets, benchmarking different CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks)
with IAGD and NRSGD against classical optimizers in Keras Package. Results
demonstrate the potential of those two viable improvement methods in SGD,
implicating the effectiveness of the advancements.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is
a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently
exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a
crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal
resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine
learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be
extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present
Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It
leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary
satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12
hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg}
(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly
outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly
higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than
previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse
regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US.
Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant
improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions
skill score for all precipitation rates and lead times. Crucially, our model
generates forecasts in under a minute, making it readily deployable for
real-time applications. It is already deployed for millions of users on Google
Search. This work represents a key step in reducing global disparities in
forecast quality and integrating sparse, high-resolution satellite observations
into weather forecasting.

Abstract: Finding "true" clusters in a data set is a challenging problem. Clustering
solutions obtained using different models and algorithms do not necessarily
provide compact and well-separated clusters or the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster validity indices are commonly applied to identify such clusters.
Nevertheless, these indices are typically relative, and they are used to
compare clustering algorithms or choose the parameters of a clustering
algorithm. Moreover, the success of these indices depends on the underlying
data structure. This paper introduces novel absolute cluster indices to
determine both the compactness and separability of clusters. We define a
compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for
cluster pairs. This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each
cluster and the whole cluster distribution. The set of neighboring points is
used to define the margin between clusters and the overall distribution margin.
The proposed compactness and separability indices are applied to identify the
true number of clusters. Using a number of synthetic and real-world data sets,
we demonstrate the performance of these new indices and compare them with other
widely-used cluster validity indices.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple
temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for
representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict
masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable
representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal
tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve
high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with
high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM)
centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i)
multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural
spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for
high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware
loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG
compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency
bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results
demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms
existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ
tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose
brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and
multimodal biosignal integration.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了高效的下行波束成形，在性能和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡，适合动态通信环境中的实时应用。

Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming
in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing
real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic
communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm,
a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer
features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are
introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and
avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer
block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to
stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a
time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing
baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at
high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and
online learning approaches.

Conclusion: DeepCausalMMM提供了更准确、自动化的营销效果评估和预算优化解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限。

Abstract: Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical technique used to estimate the
impact of marketing activities on business outcomes such as sales, revenue, or
customer visits. Traditional MMM approaches often rely on linear regression or
Bayesian hierarchical models that assume independence between marketing
channels and struggle to capture complex temporal dynamics and non-linear
saturation effects [@Hanssens2005; @Ng2021Bayesian].
  DeepCausalMMM is a Python package that addresses these limitations by
combining deep learning, causal inference, and advanced marketing science. The
package uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to automatically learn temporal
patterns such as adstock (carryover effects) and lag, while simultaneously
learning statistical dependencies and potential causal structures between
marketing channels through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning
[@Zheng2018NOTEARS; @Gong2024CausalMMM]. Additionally, it implements Hill
equation-based saturation curves to model diminishing returns and optimize
budget allocation.
  Key innovations include: (1) a data-driven design where hyperparameters and
transformations (e.g., adstock decay, saturation curves) are learned or
estimated from data with sensible defaults, rather than requiring fixed
heuristics or manual specification, (2) multi-region modeling with both shared
and region-specific parameters, (3) robust statistical methods including Huber
loss and advanced regularization, (4) comprehensive response curve analysis for
understanding channel saturation, and (5) an extensive visualization suite with
14+ interactive dashboards for business insights.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to
traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them
efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to
their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what
types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do
this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of
thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision
log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact,
equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that
CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems
(including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than
CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster
reasoning.

Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics;
yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to
multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a
promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained
by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient
model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly
exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under
periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN).
We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that
navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting
marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and
\emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins).
Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise
parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while
preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two
dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings)
affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against
Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有程序表示方法存在困境：静态表示高效但无法洞察程序在代码变换下的行为变化，动态表示能提供性能洞察但开销大且非确定性。需要超越这种权衡。

Method: 1. 提出程序行为谱表示，通过用多样化优化序列探测程序IR并量化静态特征变化；2. 使用产品量化将连续反应向量离散化为结构化子词；3. 设计多任务Transformer模型PQ-BERT预训练学习行为代码的上下文语法。

Result: 在两个代表性编译器优化任务（最佳传递预测和-Oz收益预测）上的综合实验表明，该方法优于最先进的静态基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的准动态框架成功超越了静态和动态表示之间的权衡，通过建模程序优化敏感性实现了更有效的程序表示，为编译器优化中的机器学习应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a
fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance
compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static
representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),
are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program
will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic
representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights
into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks
due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends
this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program
representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization
sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation
generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization
sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To
effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a
compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize
the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.
Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to
learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive
experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass
Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/PREP/.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CleverCatch是一个知识引导的弱监督模型，通过将结构化领域专业知识集成到神经架构中，在共享嵌入空间中对齐规则和数据样本，从而改进医疗欺诈检测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗欺诈检测面临标签数据有限、欺诈手段不断演变和医疗记录高维度的挑战。传统监督方法受限于极端标签稀缺，而纯无监督方法往往无法捕捉临床意义上的异常。

Method: 该方法在神经架构中集成结构化领域专业知识，在共享嵌入空间中对齐规则和数据样本。通过在代表合规和违规的合成数据上联合训练编码器，学习能够泛化到复杂真实数据集的软规则嵌入。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上的实验表明，CleverCatch在四个最先进的异常检测基线方法上表现更优，AUC平均提升1.3%，召回率平均提升3.4%。消融研究进一步证明了专家规则的互补作用。

Conclusion: 将专家规则嵌入学习过程不仅能提高检测准确性，还能增加透明度，为医疗欺诈检测等高风险领域提供可解释的方法。

Abstract: Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited
availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high
dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are
challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches
often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we
introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to
detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and
interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a
neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared
embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing
both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that
generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables
data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging
the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the
large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four
state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of
1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the
complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the
framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning
process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency,
offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare
fraud detection.

Result: 实验验证CoDa-FL相比基准方法实现了更快的收敛速度、更低的通信和计算成本，以及在异构MEC设置下更高的学习精度。

Conclusion: CoDa-FL框架通过聚类和依赖感知的方法有效优化了联邦学习在多任务移动边缘计算环境中的性能。

Abstract: We study the client selection problem in Federated Learning (FL) within
mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, particularly under the dependent
multi-task settings, to reduce the total time required to complete various
learning tasks. We propose CoDa-FL, a Cluster-oriented and Dependency-aware
framework designed to reduce the total required time via cluster-based client
selection and dependent task assignment. Our approach considers Earth Mover's
Distance (EMD) for client clustering based on their local data distributions to
lower computational cost and improve communication efficiency. We derive a
direct and explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of
training rounds required for convergence, thereby simplifying the otherwise
complex process of obtaining the optimal solution. Additionally, we incorporate
a directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling mechanism to effectively manage
task dependencies. Through numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed
CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks by achieving faster convergence, lower
communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under
heterogeneous MEC settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERA是一个通过选择性、自适应干预来减少语言模型错误的框架，通过优化干预方向和校准干预时机与强度，在无法自信修正时选择弃权，从而安全有效地提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定、手动调整的干预强度，往往导致干预不足或过度干预，MERA旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 通过优化干预方向和校准何时干预以及干预强度，在无法自信修正时选择弃权，可证明地改善性能。

Result: 在多个数据集和语言模型家族上的实验表明，MERA能够安全、有效地进行非降级的错误修正，并优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MERA可作为通用且高效的机制激活干预方法，应用于现有干预技术之上进一步提升性能。

Abstract: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled
framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through
selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed,
manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering,
MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction,
and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving
performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments
across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,
non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.
Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further
enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient
approach to mechanistic activation steering.

TL;DR: 提出了ToSFiT方法，通过微调大型语言模型实现Thompson采样，避免了在大型离散空间中最大化采集函数的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型非结构化离散空间中，贝叶斯优化由于缺乏梯度导致采集函数最大化计算成本高昂，需要一种可扩展的替代方法。

Method: 基于Thompson采样的方法，通过直接参数化候选解产生最大奖励的概率，利用提示条件化大型语言模型的先验知识，并逐步调整它们逼近后验分布。

Result: 在FAQ响应精炼、热稳定蛋白搜索和量子电路设计三个任务上验证，在线微调显著提高了样本效率，对计算效率影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ToSFiT方法通过变分Thompson采样实现了与标准方法相当的强理论保证，同时在实际应用中表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered
by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the
absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson
sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by
directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum
reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the
prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and
incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a
novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that
matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals
the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of
maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we
validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally
stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online
fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on
computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Generalist框架，通过将整体泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个子任务由专门的基学习器处理，然后插值参数形成全局学习器，缓解对抗训练中的自然精度下降和跨攻击鲁棒性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练虽然是最有效的防御方法，但在实际应用中存在两大局限：自然精度显著下降，以及在不同范数约束攻击下的鲁棒性迁移性差。

Method: 将泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个子任务由专门的基学习器处理；在训练后期插值基学习器参数形成全局学习器；定期将全局参数重新分配给基学习器以防止优化轨迹偏离共享目标。

Result: 理论分析和大量实验表明，Generalist实现了更低的泛化误差，显著缓解了与基线方法相比的权衡问题。

Conclusion: Generalist为未来开发完全鲁棒的分类器提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable
to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the
most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical
applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade
significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer
well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior
works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we
propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,
each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated
objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the
later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a
knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global
parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories
from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist
and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist
achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off
problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist
provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the
future.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有等变GNN方法通过更深架构、增强体阶或增加可导向特征维度来实现完备性，但计算成本高且缺乏多项式时间解决方案，需要更高效的实现方式。

Method: 基于理论证明，提出由完整标量函数和满秩可导向基集构成的框架，并在EGNN和TFN模型基础上开发高效算法构建完全等变GNN。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个理论严谨且实用的框架，能够高效构建完全等变GNN，解决了现有方法计算成本高的问题。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant
success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the
universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the
network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among
different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented
body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high
computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we
present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete
equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete
equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete
scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and
2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an
efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two
common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model
demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few
layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining
strong practical efficacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在离线或基于模型的强化学习中表现出色，但在在线无模型强化学习中仍未被充分探索，主要因为其对训练设置和模型设计决策（如策略和价值网络结构、组件共享、时序信息处理）的敏感性。

Method: 研究关键设计问题：如何调节输入、在actor和critic之间共享组件、以及如何切片序列数据进行训练。通过实验探索稳定的架构和训练策略。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在在线强化学习中应用Transformer提供了实用指导，表明Transformer可以成为连续控制任务的强基线。

Abstract: Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based
reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online
model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design
decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share
components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that
transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online
model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs,
share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for
training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies
enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks,
and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical
guidance for applying transformers in online RL.

Motivation: 跨模态知识蒸馏技术在实践中效果不稳定，主要原因是缺乏理论指导。需要建立理论框架来解释跨模态KD何时有效。

Method: 提出跨模态互补性假设(CCH)，在联合高斯模型中理论验证，并在图像、文本、视频、音频和癌症组学等多模态数据集上进行实证验证。

Result: 理论分析和实证研究都支持CCH假设，为跨模态KD提供了理论依据，并建立了选择最优教师模态的实践指南。

Conclusion: CCH为理解跨模态知识蒸馏提供了新的理论框架，基于CCH准则可以指导选择最优教师模态来提升较弱模态的性能。

Abstract: The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant
interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer
"teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during
model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across
various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved
outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could
inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal
Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective
when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds
the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We
theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it
empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video,
audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical
framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines
based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving
the performance of weaker modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高层建筑会导致停车场GPS点从实际位置漂移，且低成本GPS设备本身存在定位误差，需要一种无监督方法来校正大量停车位中的错误GPS点。

Method: 基于停车位与道路平行的物理约束，提出无监督低秩方法，在统一框架中同时进行GPS点误差校正和对齐。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法能有效解决实际问题，对任何类型的GPS点误差都简单有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为停车场管理、政策和城市发展提供了准确的GPS数据基础，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for
residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking
spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,
parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to
cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides,
the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error.
Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a
large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper,
motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are
parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to
effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking
spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and
alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to
solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible

Motivation: 证明多项式非负性是NP难问题，SOS是充分条件但计算昂贵，现有方法需要求解维度随单项式基大小二次增长的SDP问题。

Method: 训练Transformer模型预测几乎最小的单项式基，包含三个关键组件：生成超过1亿个SOS多项式的训练数据集、Transformer架构设计与训练、确保正确终止的系统回退机制。

Result: 在200多个基准数据集上验证，相比最先进求解器实现100倍以上加速，能够解决竞争方法失败的实例。

Conclusion: 该方法为SOS编程的实际可扩展性提供了新的见解和变革潜力。

Abstract: Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with
direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and
beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)
property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In
practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally
expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose
dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS
expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis
have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented
algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer
model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,
thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall
methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset
generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the
corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to
ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our
approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$
compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances
where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards
transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

Method: 在固定模型、采样器和步长的控制协议下，利用Fisher信息矩阵等于充分统计量协方差的恒等式，可视化模型样本的经验矩。

Result: QUBO编码在Fisher信息矩阵中产生更多小特征值方向，降低谱熵，导致随机梯度下降收敛更慢；自然梯度下降对编码具有重参数化不变性。

Conclusion: 对于基于SGD的训练，Ising编码提供更各向同性的曲率和更快收敛；对于QUBO，中心化/缩放或NGD式预处理可缓解曲率问题。

Abstract: We compare Ising ({-1,+1}) and QUBO ({0,1}) encodings for Boltzmann machine
learning under a controlled protocol that fixes the model, sampler, and step
size. Exploiting the identity that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) equals
the covariance of sufficient statistics, we visualize empirical moments from
model samples and reveal systematic, representation-dependent differences. QUBO
induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating
more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy. This
ill-conditioning explains slower convergence under stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). In contrast, natural gradient descent (NGD)-which rescales updates by
the FIM metric-achieves similar convergence across encodings due to
reparameterization invariance. Practically, for SGD-based training, the Ising
encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster convergence; for QUBO,
centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning mitigates curvature pathologies.
These results clarify how representation shapes information geometry and
finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines and yield actionable
guidelines for variable encoding and preprocessing.

TL;DR: 提出基于CLIP框架的多模态癫痫检测模型DistilCLIP-EEG，整合EEG信号和文本描述，通过知识蒸馏训练轻量级学生模型，在多个数据集上准确率超过97%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法仅依赖单模态EEG信号，忽略了多模态信息的潜在优势，需要开发能整合EEG和文本的多模态模型。

Method: 使用Conformer架构作为EEG编码器，提出Learnable BERT作为文本编码器，在共享潜在空间进行跨模态表示学习，并通过知识蒸馏训练更紧凑的学生模型。

Result: 在TUSZ、AUBMC和CHB-MIT数据集上，教师和学生模型准确率均超过97%，F1分数均高于0.94，学生模型参数量约为教师模型的58.1%。

Conclusion: 该模型为EEG癫痫检测提供了有效解决方案，并为资源受限环境部署轻量级模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief
episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical
discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep
learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,
neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,
we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP
framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture
comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder
based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable
BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared
latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance
efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where
the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student
model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT
datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding
97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94,
demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework.
Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately
58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity
and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results
highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection
and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in
resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于截断影响函数(TIF)的偏好数据质量评估方法，发现数据质量是模型相关的，并开发了两种简化的评分函数来改进偏好数据选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常使用外部奖励模型或现成LLM预处理训练数据集来识别有价值的偏好对，但很少检查单个数据点是否真正有益。需要改进偏好数据选择方法以适应特定模型。

Method: 提出截断影响函数(TIF)评估数据质量，开发两种与TIF正相关但计算更简单的评分函数，并通过组合这些函数来抵消各自的误差源。

Result: 实验表明，使用更少的数据可以实现更好的对齐性能，证明了方法的通用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 偏好数据质量是模型相关的属性，提出的数据选择规则能够更精确地选择有价值的偏好数据，提升对齐性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning
from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data
critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training
datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or
off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining
whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data
quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly
proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring
present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is
inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits
one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data
selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we
introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally
simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model
dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for
preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently
exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset
their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection
rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable
preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and
various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment
performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our
findings and new methods.

Motivation: 研究在保护人类偏好标签隐私的前提下，如何有效进行RLHF模型对齐，解决隐私保护与模型性能之间的平衡问题。

Method: 在离线设置中使用悲观主义原则设计算法，在在线设置中使用乐观主义原则设计算法，并引入KL正则化和局部差分隐私机制。

Result: 离线设置中获得了$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$的次优性差距，并证明其最优性；在线设置中获得了$O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T)/(e^\epsilon-1)^2)$的对数遗憾界。

Conclusion: 成功设计了在LDP约束下的RLHF算法，提供了理论保证，并首次分析了在线KL正则化RLHF问题，为隐私保护的模型对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used
objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$
local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human
preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the
principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under
single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a
matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the
problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm
and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log
(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time
step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF.
As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for
online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the
offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source
code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络在领域自适应中表现不佳，主要原因是未能区分处理全局和局部模式，导致图结构细节在多层GNN后可能被破坏。

Method: 提出FracNet，包含两个协同模块：将原始图分解为高频和低频分量，进行频率感知的领域自适应，并集成对比学习框架。

Result: 大量实验表明FracNet相比最先进方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过频谱分析和对比学习，FracNet能更好地理解领域偏移，在领域自适应任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant
structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable
patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do
not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details
in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that
domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where
low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and
high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we
propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware
\underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two
synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and
low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover,
the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating
with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we
also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of
FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 解决移动设备上大型语言模型部署中，LoRA适配器增量交付时的在线持续合并挑战，需要在有限存储下保持所有任务性能。

Method: 采用数据无关且计算高效的选择和合并策略，当新LoRA可用时，在存储预算内选择最优的适配器组合进行合并。

Result: 在真实世界任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在遵守设备存储和计算限制的同时，相比替代策略具有优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的策略有效解决了设备上LoRA在线持续合并问题，在资源受限环境下实现了良好的性能保持。

Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight
resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile
devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple
LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered
incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem
types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online
continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while
preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we
propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and
merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store
only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world
tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative
strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of
on-device settings.

Motivation: 现有GNN架构在表达能力上有限，且更强大的架构往往计算成本高昂。需要开发既强大又高效的GNN架构。

Method: 基于Chiba和Nishizeki的经典三角形计数算法，在消息传递过程中显式使用三角形信息，设计EB-1WL测试和EB-GNN架构。

Result: EB-1WL比1-WL显著更强大，提供了一阶逻辑的完整逻辑特征描述；EB-GNN在实用图学习任务中仅需近线性时间和内存；在实验中大幅优于简单MPNN，与任务专用GNN竞争但计算效率更高。

Conclusion: EB-GNN是一种高效通用的GNN架构，在保持强大表达能力的同时实现了计算效率，为图学习提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding
GNN architecture, EB-GNN. Our architecture is inspired by a classic triangle
counting algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki, and explicitly uses triangles during
message passing. We achieve the following results: (1)~EB-1WL is significantly
more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical
characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching
distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important
distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures,
EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph
learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient
general-purpose architecture: It substantially outperforms simple MPNNs, and

Motivation: 解决现实世界中多模态数据异构性挑战，现有联邦学习框架在非理想设置下效果有限，无法处理客户端间模态和样本分布不对称的情况。

Method: 提出BlendFL框架，同步混合水平和垂直联邦学习方法；引入去中心化推理机制；开发BlendAvg自适应全局模型聚合策略。

Result: 在三个分类任务上的实验表明，BlendFL在多模态和单模态分类中均优于现有方法，消融研究显示其收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: BlendFL在处理多模态数据异构性方面具有巨大潜力，特别适用于医疗和金融等数据隐私至关重要的领域。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of collaborative machine learning, without data
sharing, is multimodal data heterogeneity in real-world settings. While
Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across multiple clients,
existing frameworks, such as horizontal and vertical FL, are only effective in
`ideal' settings that meet specific assumptions. Hence, they struggle to
address scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented
across the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a
novel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and
vertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry
across clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either
of the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset.
In addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering
clients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data,
thereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also
introduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that
prioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We
trained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three
classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset
and a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior
performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification. Ablation studies
demonstrate BlendFL's faster convergence compared to traditional approaches,
accelerating collaborative learning. Overall, in our study we highlight the
potential of BlendFL for handling multimodal data heterogeneity for
collaborative learning in real-world settings where data privacy is crucial,
such as in healthcare and finance.

Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型的发展，其零样本预测能力带来了新的评估挑战。现有评估方法存在数据完整性、信息泄露和基准数据混淆等问题，需要建立更可靠的评估框架。

Method: 通过调查现有TSFM评估实践，识别出多个关键挑战，包括基准数据集代表性、时空评估缺失、数据分区混淆、信息泄露风险以及外部冲击导致的模式记忆问题。

Result: 研究发现现有评估中存在广泛的数据分区混淆，可能导致性能估计膨胀和全局知识错误传递到局部时间序列。评估数据的重叠和不透明性带来了信息泄露风险。

Conclusion: 需要开发稳健的评估方法，避免在LLM和经典时间序列基准测试中已观察到的陷阱，建议研究社区设计新的原则性方法，如基于真正样本外未来数据的评估，以保障TSFM评估的完整性。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time
series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the
need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large
Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive
training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of
benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights
multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark
datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information
leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global
patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our
findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking
inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to
local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation
methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time
series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new,
principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data,
to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

Result: 实验表明XNN与原始模型表现相当，且在未见维度上展现出更优的泛化能力。

Conclusion: XNN成功解决了物理数据训练中的维度变化问题，多维预训练对基础模型至关重要。

Abstract: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced
general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot
inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics
data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a
unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems.
Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate
encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To
address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the
Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as
Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor
dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE
foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance
across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple
PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform
competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to
unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining
for foundation models.

Motivation: 标准保形预测假设数据独立同分布，但在联邦学习中客户端数据分布差异显著。现有联邦CP方法只保证边际覆盖，无法反映输入条件不确定性。

Method: 使用生成模型（如归一化流或扩散模型）近似条件数据分布，无需共享原始数据。客户端本地校准反映其独特不确定性的保形分数，通过联邦聚合保持全局一致性。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，Fed-CCP实现了更具适应性的预测集。

Conclusion: Fed-CCP通过生成模型有效解决了联邦学习中数据异构性问题，实现了条件覆盖的保形预测。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty
quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the
true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated
learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP
assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client
distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this
by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail
to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated
Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims
for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP
leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to
approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw
data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that
reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through
federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP
achieves more adaptive prediction sets.

Conclusion: 单纯形嵌入通过几何归纳偏置产生稀疏离散特征，能够稳定评论家引导并增强策略梯度，有效提高强化学习算法的样本效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of
actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization;
unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment
interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that
well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample
efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of
simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain
embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in
sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen
policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial
embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across
a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in
runtime speed.

Motivation: 生成扩散模型在动态降尺度中缺乏有限样本保证，容易产生过度自信的预测，导致网格点级不确定性估计失准，影响在业务环境中的可靠性。

Abstract: Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological
fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical
applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling.
Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven
tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable
sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample
guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated
grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in
operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the
downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the
DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates,
incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting
locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The
proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled
to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with
markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM
baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for
more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological
fields.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language

to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,
there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic
improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale
systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a
principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit
sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of
common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and
compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic
performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,
and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without
materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow
predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale
runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation
performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work
provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a
practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long
achieved in pre-training.

Result: 在22个真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ISER在11个基线方法中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: ISER通过集成表示和基于相似性的评分有效解决了现有异常检测方法的局限性，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with
applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring.
Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods
still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional
assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different
anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based
Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based
methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics
while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs
ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information:
smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse
areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures
pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical
anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of
Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address
axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance
over 11 baseline methods.

Result: 推导了接收智能体奖励遗憾的信息论下界，证明了该攻击对最先进的基于模型和无模型算法的影响。

Conclusion: 这种信息论方法可扩展到其他类型的对抗攻击，如状态观测攻击，为RL系统安全性评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged
in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial
decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the
robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various
adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work
considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the
recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In
this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of
adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion
information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the
transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very
limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during
the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient
agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this
notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial
attack, such as state observation attacks.

TL;DR: RockNet是一种专为超低功耗硬件设计的TinyML方法，通过分布式学习和无线通信集成，在时间序列分类任务中实现最先进精度，无需离线预训练。


<details>

Motivation: 随着机器学习在信息物理系统中的普及，需要从云端训练转向设备端处理(TinyML)，但超低功耗微控制器的有限计算资源使训练面临挑战。

Method: 设计分布式学习方法，集成机器学习和无线通信，利用所有设备进行分布式训练，结合定制的无线多跳通信协议克服通信瓶颈。

Result: 在20个超低功耗设备的测试平台上，RockNet成功从零学习时间序列分类任务，准确率比最新的微控制器神经网络训练方法提高2倍，分布式架构在扩展到20个设备时使每个设备的内存、延迟和能耗降低90%。

Conclusion: 分布式机器学习、分布式计算和通信的紧密集成首次实现了在超低功耗硬件上以最先进精度进行训练。

Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to
on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency
concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose
limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents
RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault
or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that
CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that
integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for
distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need
minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and
efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes
the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.
Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate
RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks
from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network
microcontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture
reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when
scaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight
integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication
enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with
state-of-the-art accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在战略分类中引入弃权机制的影响，证明弃权不仅能提高分类器准确性，还能作为操纵威慑，使代理人的操纵成本增加，特别是在操纵成本足够影响代理人行为时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法决策日益普遍但易受战略操纵，先前研究表明分类器弃权能显著提高准确性。本文旨在探索在战略分类背景下引入弃权如何影响战略代理人的反应，以及主体应如何最优利用弃权机制。

Method: 使用Stackelberg博弈模型，主体作为分类器首先宣布决策策略，然后战略代理人作为追随者操纵其特征以获得期望结果。专注于二元分类器，代理人操纵可观察特征而非真实特征。

Result: 最优弃权确保主体的效用（或损失）在战略代理人存在时不会比非弃权设置更差。弃权不仅能提高准确性，还能作为操纵威慑，使代理人特别是资质较差的代理人操纵成本增加。

Conclusion: 弃权是减少算法决策系统中战略行为负面影响的宝贵工具，既能提高准确性，又能增加操纵成本，特别是在操纵成本显著影响代理人行为时。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable
to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research
has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a
decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier
accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification
context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and
how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a
Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces
its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate
their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary
classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true
features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility
(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of
strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can
also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents,
especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome
when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These
results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative
effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

Result: 在12个真实世界不完整数据集上的聚类任务中，该方法相比现有方法表现出优越性能，同时保持线性时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 邻近核提供了一种有效的方法来直接计算不完整数据之间的相似性，避免了传统插补方法的信息损失和偏差问题。

Abstract: Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in
web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional
approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a
preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity
estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure
that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature
space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method
introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project
data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density
variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback
strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks
on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while
maintaining linear time complexity. All the code are available at

Conclusion: 验证了依赖建模与对比学习结合的有效性，为云服务异常检测提供了完整技术方案，在复杂环境中展现出强大的适应性和稳定性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse
anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency
modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The
method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts
temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a
graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for
context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then
introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the
separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space.
Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain
representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term
fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and
temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across
multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically
evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity
perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC,
while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring
noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of
integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete
technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability in complex environments.

Conclusion: 该预测市场设计为数据受限环境下的预测协作提供了可行解决方案，平衡了参与者利益与市场效率。

Abstract: Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are
increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data
ownership and competitive interests. In contrast to recent proposals within
cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general
framework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade
forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and
analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of
the agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting
agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust
regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling
missing submissions. Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that
considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several
desirable economic properties. Case-studies using simulated and real-world data
allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market
design.

*Benjamin Kempinski,Tal Kachman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出使用图神经网络（GNN）近似计算网络流博弈中的Banzhaf值，解决了传统方法在大规模系统中的计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统精确计算方法在超过约20个代理时变得不可行，而蒙特卡洛采样方法样本复杂度高且无法在不同网络配置间迁移知识，限制了大规模动态系统的应用。

Method: 将问题构建为图级预测任务，使用三种最先进的GNN架构（GAT、GINE、EdgeConv）在大规模合成数据集上进行训练，学习从网络拓扑和控制结构中提取代理影响力的通用模式。

Result: 训练后的GNN模型实现了高保真度的Banzhaf值近似，相比精确和基于采样的方法获得了数量级的速度提升，并展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了GNN作为复杂网络系统可扩展合作博弈论分析的实用工具，能够准确预测具有不同结构特性的新网络的Banzhaf值而无需重新训练。

Abstract: Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for
quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging
from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is
intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential
complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide
statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot
transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them
impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel
learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate
Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a
graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent
influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a
comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN
architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with
Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of
200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count
(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained
GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with
order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most
significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on
graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for
entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring
retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable
cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.

TL;DR: 提出一个假设宽松的框架，用于评估生存分析中条件平均治疗效果估计在面临删失偏差时的稳健性。使用部分识别方法推导CATE的信息边界，开发具有双重稳健性和准oracle效率的新型元学习器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验中高达一半的患者因副作用或其他原因提前退出研究，当退出是信息性时（即依赖于生存时间），会引入删失偏差，导致治疗效果估计也存在偏差。

Method: 使用部分识别方法推导条件平均治疗效果的信息边界，开发新型元学习器，该学习器可以使用任意机器学习模型估计边界，并具有双重稳健性和准oracle效率的理论特性。

Result: 通过数值实验和癌症药物试验应用证明了元学习器的实用价值，能够识别在信息性删失情况下治疗仍然有效的患者亚组。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估在存在删失情况下估计治疗效果稳健性提供了实用工具，促进了生存数据在医学和流行病学中证据生成的可靠使用。

Abstract: Dropout is common in clinical studies, with up to half of patients leaving
early due to side effects or other reasons. When dropout is informative (i.e.,
dependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which
treatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an
assumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring
bias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as
non-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial
identification to derive informative bounds on the CATE. Thereby, our framework
helps to identify patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite
informative censoring. We further develop a novel meta-learner that estimates
the bounds using arbitrary machine learning models and with favorable
theoretical properties, including double robustness and quasi-oracle
efficiency. We demonstrate the practical value of our meta-learner through
numerical experiments and in an application to a cancer drug trial. Together,
our framework offers a practical tool for assessing the robustness of estimated
treatment effects in the presence of censoring and thus promotes the reliable
use of survival data for evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology.

Abstract: Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a
critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems.
Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR /
LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information,
particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate
illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging
has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric
disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the
advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face
significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR
datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to
synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming
spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast
enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework
integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized
encoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and
a softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR
benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real
RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion
framework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural
fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal
baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of
U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight
substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and
autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaLog是一个轻量级自适应系统，通过消除特征级冗余数据和优化异构行为存储，显著减少移动应用中用户行为日志的存储成本，同时保持模型推理准确性和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在移动应用中的普及，记录用户行为数据带来了巨大的存储成本，导致系统响应性降低和应用卸载率增加。现有工业实践存在两个关键低效问题：不同特征和模型间重叠行为数据的冗余记录，以及异构属性描述导致存储稀疏。

Method: AdaLog首先将特征级冗余数据消除建模为超图中的最大加权匹配问题，并提出分层算法用于设备端高效部署。然后采用虚拟哈希属性设计将异构行为分布到少量物理存储密集的日志文件中。最后设计增量更新机制以适应动态用户行为模式。

Result: 在真实用户数据上的评估显示，AdaLog将行为日志大小减少了19%到44%，系统开销极小（仅2秒延迟和15MB内存使用）。

Conclusion: AdaLog为设备端机器学习的更广泛应用提供了更高效的数据基础，有效解决了移动应用中用户行为日志的存储瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into modern mobile
apps to enable personalized and intelligent services. These models typically
rely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture
user intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording
necessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,
leading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this
storage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system
designed to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded
mobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We
identify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user
behavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across
different features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing
behaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To
solve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level
redundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and
proposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,
AdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous
behaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to
ensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an
incremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting
outdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into
popular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on
real-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%
with minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),
providing a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device
ML.

Motivation: 分别训练的相似数据嵌入模型产生的表示虽然编码了稳定信息，但无法直接互换使用。这种互操作性缺失给模型重训练、部分模型升级和多模态搜索等实际应用带来了挑战。

Method: 证明如果成对点积近似保持，则存在一个等距变换能够紧密对齐两个嵌入集，并提供了对齐误差的紧界。基于此提出了Procrustes后处理的简单对齐方法。

Conclusion: Procrustes后处理能够有效实现嵌入模型的互操作性，同时保持各自嵌入空间的几何特性，为解决实际应用中的嵌入对齐问题提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Embedding models trained separately on similar data often produce
representations that encode stable information but are not directly
interchangeable. This lack of interoperability raises challenges in several
practical applications, such as model retraining, partial model upgrades, and
multimodal search. Driven by these challenges, we study when two sets of
embeddings can be aligned by an orthogonal transformation. We show that if
pairwise dot products are approximately preserved, then there exists an
isometry that closely aligns the two sets, and we provide a tight bound on the
alignment error. This insight yields a simple alignment recipe, Procrustes
post-processing, that makes two embedding models interoperable while preserving
the geometry of each embedding space. Empirically, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in three applications: maintaining compatibility across
retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving
mixed-modality search, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the
laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss
function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to
oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination
therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often
sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding
inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we
extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed
biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is
able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only
a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning
the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution
to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We

*Ashish Bhatia,Renato Cordeiro de Amorim,Vito De Feo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Mamdani系统可解释性和TSK模型精度的新型模糊回归方法，通过混合规则结构和双重支配类型来平衡准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回归方法在处理现实世界数据的不确定性和模糊性方面存在困难，深度学习缺乏可解释性且容易在小数据集上过拟合，而现有模糊系统在可解释性和准确性之间存在权衡。

Method: 开发了一种混合模糊回归方法，结合了Mamdani系统的可解释性和TSK模型的精度，采用带有模糊和清晰组件的混合规则结构以及双重支配类型。

Result: 在6个基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法在4个数据集中获得了最佳模糊方法得分，在2个数据集中优于不透明模型，在1个数据集中获得最佳总体得分，RMSE改进范围从0.4%到19%。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法为预测建模提供了一个平衡且多功能的工具，有效解决了模糊系统中可解释性与准确性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Regression analysis is employed to examine and quantify the relationships
between input variables and a dependent and continuous output variable. It is
widely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and
engineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data
complexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning
approaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack
interpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide
an alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani
and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths:
interpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression
method that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision
of TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with
fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy
and explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a
component similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision
through improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and
versatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between
interpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets
tested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4
datasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best
overall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to
19%.

*Masahiro Fujisawa,Futoshi Futami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次从理论上证明了标准的L2正则化经验风险最小化可以直接控制平滑校准误差，无需后处理校正或专门的校准正则化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率预测的校准对于可靠的机器学习至关重要，但标准训练程序如何产生良好校准模型的理解仍然不足。

Method: 基于优化误差、正则化强度和Rademacher复杂度建立了平滑校准误差的有限样本泛化界，并在再生核希尔伯特空间模型中实例化该理论。

Result: 实验验证了理论保证，表明L2正则化ERM可以提供良好校准的模型，无需增强或后处理重新校准。

Conclusion: 标准L2正则化经验风险最小化本身就具有内在的校准能力，无需额外的校准技术。

Abstract: Calibration of predicted probabilities is critical for reliable machine
learning, yet it is poorly understood how standard training procedures yield
well-calibrated models. This work provides the first theoretical proof that
canonical $L_{2}$-regularized empirical risk minimization directly controls the
smooth calibration error (smCE) without post-hoc correction or specialized
calibration-promoting regularizer. We establish finite-sample generalization
bounds for smCE based on optimization error, regularization strength, and the
Rademacher complexity. We then instantiate this theory for models in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, deriving concrete guarantees for kernel
ridge and logistic regression. Our experiments confirm these specific
guarantees, demonstrating that $L_{2}$-regularized ERM can provide a
well-calibrated model without boosting or post-hoc recalibration. The source
code to reproduce all experiments is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了马尔可夫决策过程中偏差最优性层次结构的策略识别问题，构建了具有渐近误差的学习算法，并确定了能在有限时间内停止识别的MDP类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平均收益最优性在MDP中过于渐进，需要结合即时损失度量来考虑偏差最优性层次结构，直至Blackwell最优性。

Method: 为每个最优性阶构建学习算法，并开发可触发有限时间停止的停止规则。

Result: 确定了具有唯一Bellman最优策略的MDP类别可以在有限时间内停止识别，且该类别与最优性阶无关。

Conclusion: 提出了一个可追踪的停止规则，当与学习算法结合时，在可能的情况下能在有限时间内触发停止。

Abstract: Although average gain optimality is a commonly adopted performance measure in
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), it is often too asymptotic. Further
incorporating measures of immediate losses leads to the hierarchy of bias
optimalities, all the way up to Blackwell optimality. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of identifying policies of such optimality orders. To
that end, for each order, we construct a learning algorithm with vanishing
probability of error. Furthermore, we characterize the class of MDPs for which
identification algorithms can stop in finite time. That class corresponds to
the MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and does not depend on the
optimality order considered. Lastly, we provide a tractable stopping rule that
when coupled to our learning algorithm triggers in finite time whenever it is
possible to do so.

TL;DR: ProtoTopic是一种基于原型网络的主题模型，专门用于医学论文摘要的主题生成，在数据有限的情况下表现优于传统主题模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型在医学文本上表现不佳，特别是当某些医疗主题的文档数量较少时。需要开发能够在低数据场景下有效工作的主题建模方法。

Method: 使用原型网络构建主题模型，通过计算输入数据点与一组原型表示之间的距离来进行预测，这种方法在少样本学习场景中特别有效。

Result: 与文献中使用的两种主题建模基线相比，ProtoTopic在主题连贯性和多样性方面都有所改善，能够生成医学相关主题。

Conclusion: ProtoTopic证明了在数据有限的情况下生成医学相关主题的能力，原型网络是解决医疗领域主题建模挑战的有效方法。

Abstract: Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written
documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed
topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to
medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for
some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a
prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of
medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable
models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints
and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in
low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate
improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines
used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate
medically relevant topics even with limited data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了多目标在线凸优化问题，考虑K个不同的损失函数序列，通过最小化最大遗憾来平衡跟踪多个序列的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展传统在线凸优化(OCO)到多目标场景，解决需要同时跟踪多个损失函数序列的实际问题，其中基准是最优离线算法采取的静态动作。

Method: 提出结合Hedge算法和在线梯度下降(OGD)的简单算法，用于i.i.d.输入设置中的多目标OCO问题。

Result: 算法在期望最小最大遗憾上达到O(√(T log K))的上界，通过简洁的证明展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法在多目标在线凸优化中实现了优异性能，能够有效平衡多个损失序列的跟踪需求。

Abstract: In online convex optimization (OCO), a single loss function sequence is
revealed over a time horizon of $T$, and an online algorithm has to choose its
action at time $t$, before the loss function at time $t$ is revealed. The goal
of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$
compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm
knowing all functions of the sequence in advance.
  In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective
OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has
to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are
revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences,
we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline
algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the
maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the
$K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time
slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its
$\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$
regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret
needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.
  We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where
all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the
i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known
$\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably
simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log
K})$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦持续学习方法在性能、隐私保护和通信效率之间难以平衡，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用低秩适配器(LoRA)减少通信开销，结合DualGradient Projection Memory防止遗忘，在异构联邦环境中学习。

Result: 在CIFAR-100等四个数据集上，DOLFIN在最终平均准确率上持续超越六个强基线方法，同时保持相同内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交低秩适配器为联邦设置中的隐私保护持续学习提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across
multiple distributed clients, protecting privacy and without forgetting
previously acquired knowledge. However, current methods face challenges
balancing performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency. We
introduce a Distributed Online LoRA for Federated INcremental learning method
DOLFIN, a novel approach combining Vision Transformers with low-rank adapters
designed to efficiently and stably learn new tasks in federated environments.
Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates
DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to prevent forgetting. Evaluated on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200 under two Dirichlet
heterogeneity settings, DOLFIN consistently surpasses six strong baselines in
final average accuracy while matching their memory footprint. Orthogonal
low-rank adapters offer an effective and scalable solution for
privacy-preserving continual learning in federated settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现选择性对抗攻击可以显著改变LLM在MMLU基准测试中的相对排名，挑战了排行榜驱动评估的公平性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试容易受到语义等效对抗扰动的影响，但现有研究主要关注对所有模型产生同等影响的攻击，而缺乏针对特定模型的选择性攻击研究。

Method: 在MMLU基准上使用TextAttack框架的规范攻击，开发选择性评估协议，创建定制约束以提高攻击选择性，并提出了基于代理LLM的选择性扰动生成管道。

Result: 实验证明选择性对抗攻击确实存在，能够实质性改变模型的相对排名，即使微小的编辑也能影响比较判断。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了LLM评估中需要扰动感知报告和鲁棒性诊断，表明当前排行榜评估方法在对抗攻击面前存在脆弱性。

Abstract: Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of
LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent
adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has
emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the
question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance
performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem
and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark
designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning
ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into
TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,
develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a
surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we
find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative
rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of
leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware
reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that
even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.

Motivation: 在先进节点中，功耗、性能和面积的优化变得复杂且具有挑战性。机器学习和设计技术协同优化面临训练数据缺乏和设计流程周转时间长的限制。

Method: 提出ArtNet人工网表生成器，复制关键拓扑特征，生成与目标参数匹配的现实人工数据集，支持设计空间探索。

Result: 在CNN基的DRV预测中，ArtNet数据增强使F1分数提高0.16；在DTCO中，生成的小型设计实现97.94%的PPA匹配度。

Conclusion: ArtNet通过生成多样化且现实的人工数据集，有效解决了训练数据不足问题，显著提升了机器学习模型性能和设计技术协同优化效果。

Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has
become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and
design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but
face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design
flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist
generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet
replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization
and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing
realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters,
ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and
design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data
augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original
(real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA
match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of
targeted full-scale block designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEEG信号分析对脑机接口和神经科学研究至关重要，但由于输入通道数量大且相关性异质，传统通道选择方法难以扩展或提供有意义的可解释性。

Method: 提出EEGChaT模块，引入通道聚合令牌(CATs)跨通道聚合信息，利用改进的注意力展开技术计算可解释的定量通道重要性分数。

Result: 在DuIN数据集上评估，EEGChaT与现有分类模型结合能持续提高解码准确率，实现高达17%的绝对增益，且通道权重与人工选择通道有显著重叠。

Conclusion: EEGChaT是高维SEEG分析中有效且可推广的通道选择解决方案，既提升了性能又提供了神经信号相关性的洞察。

Abstract: Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet
poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and
their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle
to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we
propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to
automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings.
EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information
across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to
compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate
EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with
existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy,
achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced
by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting
the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an
effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional
SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural
signal relevance.

Motivation: 现代传感和成像技术产生了复杂几何域上的高维时空数据，但由于不规则空间结构、快速时间动态以及多变量联合预测的需求，有效建模这些数据仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了几何感知的多任务高斯过程模型来捕捉时空结构和任务间依赖关系，并通过基于物理的规则化方案将控制物理定律纳入模型，确保预测符合动态原理。

Conclusion: P-M-GP框架成功地将几何感知、多任务学习和物理约束相结合，为复杂时空动态系统提供了高保真度的建模解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the
collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric
domains. However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to
irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly
predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a
physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for
spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware,
multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the
model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a
physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be
consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP
framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over
existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical
constraints and geometric prior.

Motivation: 由于隐私法规和安全要求，必须能够从联邦学习模型中移除特定客户端的贡献。现有方法需要多轮通信，导致模型在移除过程中不可用，影响系统服务。

Method: 使用任务算术和神经正切核技术，开发快速移除客户端影响的方法，避免多轮通信需求。

Result: 该方法能够快速有效地从模型中移除特定客户端的数据影响，同时保持模型性能。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案解决了联邦学习中客户端贡献移除的效率和可用性问题，为隐私保护型AI系统提供了实用的知识移除机制。

Abstract: Nowdays, there are an abundance of portable devices capable of collecting
large amounts of data and with decent computational power. This opened the
possibility to train AI models in a distributed manner, preserving the
participating clients' privacy. However, because of privacy regulations and
safety requirements, elimination upon necessity of a client contribution to the
model has become mandatory. The cleansing process must satisfy specific
efficacy and time requirements. In recent years, research efforts have produced
several knowledge removal methods, but these require multiple communication
rounds between the data holders and the process coordinator. This can cause the
unavailability of an effective model up to the end of the removal process,
which can result in a disservice to the system users. In this paper, we
introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural
Tangent Kernel, to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统框架，为经典非线性降维方法构建神经解码器架构，首次实现双向映射，并在学习到的流形空间中实现基于扩散的生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典非线性降维技术（如t-SNE、Isomap、LLE）擅长创建低维嵌入用于数据可视化，但缺乏将这些嵌入映射回原始高维空间的能力，这种单向转换限制了它们在生成应用中的使用。

Method: 构建神经解码器架构用于主要NLDR方法，实现双向映射，并扩展该框架，在学习到的流形空间中实现基于扩散的生成过程。

Result: 在CelebA数据集上的实验表明，解码器能成功重建数据，但质量不如端到端优化的自编码器；流形约束扩散产生低质量样本，表明经典NLDR嵌入的离散稀疏特性不适合生成模型所需的连续插值。

Conclusion: 这项工作凸显了在主要为可视化和分析设计的NLDR方法上添加生成能力的内在挑战。

Abstract: Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE,
Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data
visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back
to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits
their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by
introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder
architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for
the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based
generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces.
Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and
generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard
diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while
the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by
end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion
yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of
classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation
required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in
retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for
visualization and analysis.

Motivation: 大多数量子储层计算研究针对单变量信号，忽视了近期硬件约束。本文旨在开发适用于多变量时间序列的硬件友好型量子储层计算方法。

Method: 使用注入和记忆量子比特配对，采用Trotterized最近邻横向场Ising演化，针对当前设备连接性和深度进行优化。

Result: 在Lorenz-63和ENSO数据集上分别获得0.0087和0.0036的均方误差，性能与经典储层计算相当，在某些设置上优于学习型RNN。在IBM Heron R2上保持准确性，有趣的是在ENSO上甚至优于无噪声模拟器。

Conclusion: 这些发现支持基于门的量子储层计算在NISQ硬件上进行多变量时间序列预测的实用性，并激励系统研究硬件噪声何时以及如何有益于量子储层计算输出。

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a hardware-friendly approach to
temporal learning, yet most studies target univariate signals and overlook
near-term hardware constraints. This work introduces a gate-based QRC for
multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and
uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized
for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method
achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively,
performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above
learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some
settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and,
interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value
analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature
directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this
regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS
forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how
hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain
classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class.
Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate
class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this
issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with
Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced
Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority
classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components
from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is
trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent
disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are
used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration
strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem
that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to
approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the
parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring
regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior classification performance compared to several baseline and
state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular
datasets.

Abstract: Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to
second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating
training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam
and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current
gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter
uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the
recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.
  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through
the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the
impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these
optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four
quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where
Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings.
Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for
linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results
are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward
over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to
its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward
models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of
suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level
constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we
propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant
information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that
reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent
space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.
Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that
penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape
while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to
the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present
Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying
reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online
mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs
and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of
InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively
advancing the state of RLHF.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了深度学习模型在气候降尺度中的可靠性，发现现有模型在地理泛化和物理一致性方面存在不足，并提出使用功率谱密度损失函数来改进小尺度物理结构的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 千米尺度的天气数据对实际应用至关重要，但传统天气模拟计算成本高。深度学习模型提供了更快的替代方案，但其可靠性仍存疑，因为评估通常使用标准机器学习指标而非大气物理学的见解。

Method: 对最先进的深度学习模型进行基准测试，引入基于物理的诊断方法来评估性能，特别关注地理泛化和物理一致性。提出使用功率谱密度损失函数来改进模型。

Result: 实验表明，即使在欧洲有限地理区域训练的模型（如CorrDiff）也难以泛化到其他地区（如伊比利亚、摩洛哥或斯堪的纳维亚），并且无法准确捕捉从预测速度场导出的二阶变量（如散度和涡度）。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在生成物理一致的预测方面面临挑战，功率谱密度损失函数可以经验性地改善地理泛化能力，但需要进一步研究来提高物理一致性。

Abstract: Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but
remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather
simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a
faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still
in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning
metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper
benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces
physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability,
with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency.
Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models
such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g.,
central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia,
Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately
capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from
predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution
geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent
predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral
density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by
encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures. The code for
reproducing the experimental results can be found at

Result: 该算法在可聚类的BMDP类上实现了O(√T+n)的遗憾，显著优于先前最好的O(√T+n²)界限，特别是在n较大时。

Conclusion: 证明了准确估计潜在状态确实能有效加速学习，并且在该BMDP类上该算法达到了渐近最优性，因为没有任何算法能在此类上实现更低的遗憾。

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical
in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces.
Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate
learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision
Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but
where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent
advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this
latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to
determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now
addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages
clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed
effectively speed up learning.
  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first
learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an
optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm
achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible
to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the
cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds
up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior
bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that
no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs.
This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic
optimality.

Conclusion: 该渐进式多保真度代理模型能够有效利用多保真度信息，提高代理模型的预测能力，同时适应不同可用输入数据的情况。

Abstract: Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often
expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for
applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple
scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate
models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data.
Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and
encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity
information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in
practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of
different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating
the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive
multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse
data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded
inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural
networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity
levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded
inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection
system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while
ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level
without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new
input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions
based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably
integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining
performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.

Conclusion: TGPS方法通过张量分解和高效训练策略，成功解决了传统PDE求解器的可扩展性和效率问题，为大规模高维PDE求解提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have
attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural
network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and
typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process
(GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from
scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often
needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that
models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs
and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution.
This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs,
substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to
massive collocation sets.
  For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and
Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating
least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby
substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical
guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof
and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on
several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy
and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at

Abstract: Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as
cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic
monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored
compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods
often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose
fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies.
Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.
  We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that
leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class
tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This
design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled
cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic
social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks.
It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and
structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining
topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph
learning.

Abstract: Small regularizers can preserve linear programming solutions exactly. This
paper provides the first average-case analysis of exact regularization: with a
standard Gaussian cost vector and fixed constraint set, bounds are established
for the probability that exact regularization succeeds as a function of
regularization strength. Failure is characterized via the Gaussian measure of
inner cones, controlled by novel two-sided bounds on the measure of shifted
cones. Results reveal dimension-dependent scaling laws and connect exact
regularization of linear programs to their polyhedral geometry via the normal
fan and the Gaussian (solid-angle) measure of its cones. Computable bounds are
obtained in several canonical settings, including regularized optimal
transport. Numerical experiments corroborate the predicted scalings and
thresholds.

Result: 证明了最优输运映射可能高度不稳定：1）当源密度无界时；2）即使在均匀密度情况下，接近最优计划唯一性丧失的配置时也会相当不稳定。

Conclusion: 最优输运映射的稳定性不仅取决于目标测度的变化，还受到源测度特性的显著影响，特别是密度的有界性和最优计划唯一性条件。

Abstract: The stability of optimal transport maps with respect to perturbations of the
marginals is a question of interest for several reasons, ranging from the
justification of the linearized optimal transport framework to numerical
analysis and statistics. Under various assumptions on the source measure, it is
known that optimal transport maps are stable with respect to variations of the
target measure. In this note, we focus on the mechanisms that can, on the
contrary, lead to instability. We identify two of them, which we illustrate
through examples of absolutely continuous source measures $\rho$ in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ for which optimal transport maps are less stable, or even very
unstable. We first show that instability may arise from the unboundedness of
the density: we exhibit a source density on the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^d$
which blows up superpolynomially at two points of the boundary and for which
optimal transport maps are highly unstable. Then we prove that even for uniform
densities on bounded open sets, optimal transport maps can be rather unstable
close enough to configurations where uniqueness of optimal plans is lost.

Abstract: We present a new algorithm for solving large-scale security-constrained
optimal power flow in polar form (AC-SCOPF). The method builds on Nonlinearly
Constrained augmented Lagrangian (NCL), an augmented Lagrangian method in which
the subproblems are solved using an interior-point method. NCL has two key
advantages for large-scale SC-OPF. First, NCL handles difficult problems such
as infeasible ones or models with complementarity constraints. Second, the
augmented Lagrangian term naturally regularizes the Newton linear systems
within the interior-point method, enabling to solve the Newton systems with a
pivoting-free factorization that can be efficiently parallelized on GPUs. We
assess the performance of our implementation, called MadNCL, on large-scale
corrective AC-SCOPFs, with complementarity constraints modeling the corrective
actions. Numerical results show that MadNCL can solve AC-SCOPF with 500 buses
and 256 contingencies fully on the GPU in less than 3 minutes, whereas Knitro
takes more than 3 hours to find an equivalent solution.

Result: 证明了TCS解的存在性和唯一性(对几乎所有时间范围)，建立了非渐近边界，表明弱交叉耦合和低/负对数范数能提供准确的目标VCS/AECS近似，特别是在短/中等时间范围内。

Conclusion: 在人脑网络实验中发现了权衡：短时间范围内目标VCS和AECS都能被简化公式良好近似，但长时间范围内目标AECS保持鲁棒而目标VCS会恶化。

Abstract: We introduce the target controllability score (TCS), a concept for evaluating
node importance under actuator constraints and designated target objectives,
formulated within a virtual system setting. The TCS consists of the target
volumetric controllability score (VCS) and the target average energy
controllability score (AECS), each defined as an optimal solution to a convex
optimization problem associated with the output controllability Gramian. We
establish the existence and uniqueness (for almost all time horizons) and
develop a projected gradient method for their computation. To enable
scalability, we construct a target-only reduced virtual system and derive
non-asymptotic bounds showing that weak cross-coupling and a low or negative
logarithmic norm of the system matrix yield accurate approximations of target
VCS/AECS, particularly over short or moderate time horizons. Experiments on
human brain networks reveal a clear trade-off: at short horizons, both target
VCS and target AECS are well approximated by their reduced formulations, while
at long horizons, target AECS remains robust but target VCS deteriorates.

Abstract: We study a generalized version of Zermelo's navigation problem in which the
admissible set of control velocities is a strictly convex compact set, rather
than the classical spherical or ball-shaped one. After establishing existence
results under the natural assumption of weak currents, we derive necessary
optimality conditions via Pontryagin's maximum principle and convex analysis.
In particular, we prove that strictly convex control sets ensure smoothness of
optimal controls. In dimension two, this regularity allows us to eliminate the
adjoint variables and obtain a second-order differential equation for the
optimal control, which extends the classical Zermelo navigation equation to
strictly convex control sets in a non-parametric setting. We also develop the
case of an affine current, with a particular emphasis on the constant one where
optimal trajectories reduce to straight lines. The results are illustrated with
examples relevant to ship routing with asymmetric or sail-assisted propulsion.

Motivation: 解决鲁棒MPC中反馈映射的学习问题，直接在学习阶段考虑近似误差，保证系统稳定性。

Method: 分两步：数据生成（将minmax问题重构为凸半无限规划并精确求解）和学习近似反馈映射（使用近似方案在预设误差界内学习反馈策略）。

Result: 算法确保递归可行性，在标准假设下保证闭环系统稳定性，并通过两个基准数值示例验证结果。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效学习鲁棒MPC的反馈映射，处理学习误差并保证系统性能。

Abstract: We establish an algorithm to learn feedback maps from data for a class of
robust model predictive control (MPC) problems. The algorithm accounts for the
approximation errors due to the learning directly at the synthesis stage,
ensuring recursive feasibility by construction. The optimal control problem
consists of a linear noisy dynamical system, a quadratic stage and quadratic
terminal costs as the objective, and convex constraints on the state, control,
and disturbance sequences; the control minimizes and the disturbance maximizes
the objective. We proceed via two steps -- (a) Data generation: First, we
reformulate the given minmax problem into a convex semi-infinite program and
employ recently developed tools to solve it in an exact fashion on grid points
of the state space to generate (state, action) data. (b) Learning approximate
feedback maps: We employ a couple of approximation schemes that furnish tight
approximations within preassigned uniform error bounds on the admissible state
space to learn the unknown feedback policy. The stability of the closed-loop
system under the approximate feedback policies is also guaranteed under a
standard set of hypotheses. Two benchmark numerical examples are provided to
illustrate the results.

### [99] [From Literal to Liberal: A Meta-Prompting Framework for Eliciting Human-Aligned Exception Handling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12864)
*Imran Khan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RID框架，一种零样本元提示技术，通过结构化认知模式解决LLM规则僵化问题，在20个场景测试中达到95%的人类对齐分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为智能体推理引擎时存在规则僵化问题，过度遵循显式规则而忽视人类常识和意图，阻碍可信自主智能体的构建。

Method: RID框架：低计算成本的元提示技术，提供结构化认知模式来解构任务、分类规则、权衡冲突结果并证明最终决策。

Result: 在20个需要细致判断的场景测试中，RID框架达到95%人类对齐分数，显著优于基线(80%)和思维链(75%)，产生更高质量的意图驱动推理。

Conclusion: RID框架为引导LLM从字面指令遵循转向自由、目标导向推理提供了实用、可访问且有效的方法，为更可靠实用的AI智能体铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

TL;DR: DeepPlanner是一个端到端的强化学习框架，通过熵基优势函数和选择性样本加权来增强深度研究代理的规划能力，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖推理阶段的隐式规划，要么引入显式规划器但未系统优化规划阶段。研究发现规划令牌的熵显著高于其他动作令牌，表明存在未优化的不确定决策点。

Method: 提出DeepPlanner框架：1）使用基于熵的优势函数在令牌级别分配更大的更新给高熵令牌；2）选择性加权规划密集型rollouts的样本级优势。

Result: 在七个深度研究基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DeepPlanner提高了规划质量，并在显著降低的训练预算下实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DeepPlanner通过系统优化规划阶段，有效增强了深度研究代理的规划能力，为复杂任务的长时程规划提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

TL;DR: Sentinel是首个基于形式化时序逻辑的LLM具身智能体物理安全评估框架，通过语义、规划和轨迹三个层次进行多级验证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式规则或主观的LLM判断，无法精确评估LLM具身智能体在物理环境中的安全性

Method: 使用时序逻辑形式化安全需求，构建语义级（需求形式化与对齐验证）、规划级（动作计划验证）和轨迹级（执行轨迹验证）的多层次验证管道

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFRED环境中评估多个LLM具身智能体，发现先前方法忽略的安全违规，并分析失败模式

Conclusion: 通过将物理安全基于时序逻辑并在多个层次应用验证方法，Sentinel为系统评估LLM具身智能体在物理环境中的安全性提供了严谨基础

Abstract: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical
safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic,
plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules
or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in
formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state
invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a
multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive
natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the
LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with
the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals
generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect
unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple
execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently
verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety
check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate
multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our
experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and
applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a
rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in
physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous
methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

TL;DR: 提出基于微调大语言模型的框架，自动从交通事故叙述中推断驾驶员危险行为，提高分类的有效性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两车碰撞占道路事故的70%，但手动编码驾驶员危险行为数据存在不一致性和劳动密集问题，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用MTCF的五年两车碰撞数据，在详细事故叙述上微调Llama 3.2 1B模型，并与随机森林、XGBoost、CatBoost和神经网络等传统分类器进行基准测试。

Result: 微调后的LLM达到80%的整体准确率，优于所有基线模型，在数据不平衡场景中表现尤为突出。通过概率推理方法分析模型输出变化，发现分心驾驶显著增加"一般不安全驾驶"概率，双方分心最大化"双方危险行为"概率，青少年驾驶显著增加"速度和停车违规"概率。

Conclusion: 该框架和分析方法为大规模自动化DHA检测提供了稳健且可解释的解决方案，为交通安全分析和干预提供了新机会。

Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

TL;DR: 本文主张将时间序列分析重新构想为基于大型语言模型的推理任务，强调因果结构和可解释性，而非仅依赖数值回归能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列分析需要超越表面趋势，揭示驱动因素。现有LLM方法大多忽视其深层推理潜力，仅使用数值回归能力。

Method: 将时间序列分析重新定义为推理任务，整合多模态输入，优先考虑因果结构和可解释性。

Result: 该方法使时间序列分析更接近人类对齐的理解，在复杂现实环境中提供透明和上下文感知的洞察。

Conclusion: 使用LLM进行时间序列分析应注重推理能力而非数值回归，以实现更透明和上下文感知的分析方法。

Abstract: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition,
trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world
settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events
unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the
actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating
multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain
cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most
existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and
ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time
series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and
explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned
understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex
real-world environments.

### [104] [Repairing Reward Functions with Human Feedback to Mitigate Reward Hacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13036)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Preference-Based Reward Repair (PBRR)框架，通过从人类偏好中学习一个加性的、状态转移相关的修正项来自动修复人工设计的代理奖励函数，以解决奖励函数错配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工设计的强化学习奖励函数经常与人类真实目标不一致，仅作为代理目标。优化错误的代理奖励函数会导致奖励黑客行为，产生与真实目标不一致的策略。而从头学习奖励函数需要大量的人类偏好数据，成本高昂。

Method: PBRR框架通过目标探索策略和新的偏好学习目标，识别需要修正的状态转移，学习一个加性的、状态转移相关的修正项来修复代理奖励函数。

Result: 在表格化领域证明PBRR的累积遗憾与先前的基于偏好的RL方法相当。在奖励黑客基准测试中，PBRR始终优于从头学习奖励函数或使用其他方法修改代理奖励函数的基线方法，需要更少的偏好数据来学习高性能策略。

Conclusion: PBRR能够有效解决奖励函数错配问题，通过少量偏好数据修正代理奖励函数，获得与真实目标一致的高性能策略，比从头学习奖励函数更高效。

Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在情感认知方面存在严重局限：无法模拟连接虚拟与现实服务的有限理性；缺乏经过实证验证的情感整合机制。

Method: 构建情感认知框架，包含欲望生成和目标管理，模拟LLM智能体的完整决策过程：状态演化、欲望生成、目标优化、决策生成和行动执行。

Result: 在专有多智能体交互环境中实施该框架，实验结果显示，受该框架控制的智能体不仅表现出与其情感状态一致的行为，而且在比较评估中展现出更高的生态效度，决策结果更接近人类行为模式。

Conclusion: 所提出的情感认知框架能够有效提升LLM智能体在模拟人类社会互动中的真实性和情感对齐能力。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent
virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions
within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit
severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded
rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack
empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent
decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework
incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve
emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete
decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,
desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action
execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary
multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with
their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent
types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes
that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

Motivation: 深度推理虽然能提升复杂任务性能，但对所有问题都使用计算成本过高，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 使用小型LLM生成初始答案，大型LLM进行验证，如果正确则直接采用，否则大型LLM进行深度推理。

Result: 在简单问题上，大型LLM的计算成本降低超过50%，准确率损失可忽略，复杂任务上保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该互补代理系统能有效平衡计算效率和任务性能，为LLM应用提供了一种实用的成本优化方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that
chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance
on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by
enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is
computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary
agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an
initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer
is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.
Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the
computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy
loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

for PLPP that integrates a reinforcement-based training paradigm and an
LLM-driven educational architecture. We design a structured learner state model
and an automated reward function that transforms abstract objectives into
computable signals. We train the policy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and deploy it within a
real-world learning platform. Extensive experiments validate Pxplore's
effectiveness in producing coherent, personalized, and goal-driven learning
paths. We release our code and dataset to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: EvoTest框架有效解决了AI代理在测试时学习复杂技能的挑战，为开发更实用的AI代理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

Conclusion: 提出的感知模型能够有效评估学习模型的效用，为自动驾驶车辆确定合适的感知方案。

Abstract: The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving
and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research
community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep
Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles
(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately
perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to
control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based
analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the
driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom
dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a
DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the
utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model
instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection
task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'
performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show
three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,
SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the
AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.)
still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892,
truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values,
confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed
function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above
encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of
learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

TL;DR: 提出了SAJA框架，联合攻击状态和动作，通过梯度上升方法和启发式正则化器实现协同攻击效果，在MPE环境中验证了其优于单独状态或动作攻击的性能和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MADRL模型对状态和动作的对抗扰动脆弱，但现有研究只关注单独的状态攻击或动作攻击，没有有效联合两者，简单组合无法发挥协同效应。

Method: SAJA框架包含两个阶段：状态攻击阶段使用多步梯度上升方法结合actor和critic网络计算对抗状态；动作攻击阶段基于扰动状态再次使用梯度上升通过critic网络生成最终对抗动作，并加入距离正则化器增强critic指导效果。

Result: 在MPE环境中验证，SAJA优于单独状态或动作攻击，更具隐蔽性，且现有防御方法无法有效防御其攻击。

Conclusion: SAJA框架通过协同攻击状态和动作，显著提升了攻击效果，揭示了MADRL模型的安全脆弱性，需要开发更有效的防御机制。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.
We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating
that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only
attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its
attacks.

Abstract: Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory
models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of
human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game
model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the
input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based
on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically
impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired
generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode
collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator
consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing
studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,
lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit
cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and
identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends
to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading
the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions
v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel
approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),
which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game
equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a
more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a
suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and
two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在隐式因果链发现任务中的机制性因果推理能力，发现LLMs主要通过关联模式匹配而非真正的因果推理来生成因果链，但生成的链在逻辑上具有连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型如何理解因果关系，以及它们能否发现连接原因和结果之间的中间因果步骤，特别是在论证场景中的机制性因果推理能力。

Method: 使用诊断性评估框架，让9个LLMs为气候变化讨论中的因果对生成所有可能的中间因果步骤，分析其生成的因果链数量、粒度、一致性和置信度。

Result: LLMs在生成的因果步骤数量和粒度上存在差异，虽然它们对中间因果连接具有自我一致性和高置信度，但主要依赖关联模式匹配而非真正的因果推理。人类评估确认了生成链的逻辑连贯性。

Conclusion: 该研究为推进论证场景中隐式机制性因果推理的未来工作奠定了坚实基础，提供了基线方法、诊断评估见解和带有因果链的基准数据集。

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用众包QoE数据进行移动网络覆盖和弱覆盖区域分析的新框架，采用OC-SVM算法计算覆盖范围，能够准确识别城市环境中的信号弱区。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动网络运营商需要有效评估网络覆盖并精确识别服务弱区，以提升用户体验质量(QoE)。

Method: 基于众包QoE数据，在单个天线级别进行覆盖分析，然后聚合到站点级别；应用OC-SVM算法将决策超平面建模为有效覆盖轮廓；扩展相同方法分析服务丢失报告。

Result: 该框架能够准确映射移动网络覆盖，并在复杂城市环境中突出显示细粒度的信号不足区域。

Conclusion: 该新颖框架在移动网络覆盖映射和弱覆盖区域识别方面表现出高效性，特别是在复杂城市环境中。

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

*He Du,Bowen Li,Chengxing Xie,Chang Gao,Kai Chen,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew)方法，利用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励信号，无需训练即可在数学推理任务中超越现有无训练奖励方法，甚至优于大多数训练过的奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型需要大量标注数据和昂贵训练，而无训练方法如LLM-as-a-Judge虽有效但未系统研究模型置信度作为奖励的潜力。

Method: 系统研究CRew方法，使用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励代理；提出CRew-DPO训练策略，结合置信度分数和正确性信号构建偏好数据进行微调。

Result: 在MATH500和RewardMATH基准测试中，CRew超越现有无训练奖励方法，甚至优于大多数训练过的奖励模型；CRew分数与模型实际推理性能强相关；CRew能有效筛选高质量训练数据。

Conclusion: CRew是一种简单而强大的无训练奖励方法，CRew-DPO进一步提升了模型的判断能力，持续优于现有自训练方法。

Abstract: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and
costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as
LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate
responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that
model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing
between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using
confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we
systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful
training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final
answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.
Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500
and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We
further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual
reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can
effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we
propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from
confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO
further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms
existing self-training methods.

Motivation: 生成式AI在金融服务行业采用时，历史机器学习指标往往无法泛化到GenAI工作负载，且广泛使用的基准测试无法适用于工业用途，需要更好的性能评估方法。

Method: 开发了一个风险评估框架，结合领域专家评估和机器学习指标，以更好地应用这些评估方法。

Result: 该框架能够解决选择特定指标时的各种独特风险，提高模型性能测量的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的风险评估框架有助于在金融服务行业更有效地采用生成式AI，解决当前性能测量面临的挑战。

Abstract: As Generative Artificial Intelligence is adopted across the financial
services industry, a significant barrier to adoption and usage is measuring
model performance. Historical machine learning metrics can oftentimes fail to
generalize to GenAI workloads and are often supplemented using Subject Matter
Expert (SME) Evaluation. Even in this combination, many projects fail to
account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics.
Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs
and educational institutions fail to generalize to industrial use. This paper
explains these challenges and provides a Risk Assessment Framework to allow for
better application of SME and machine learning Metrics

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为"串联训练"的强化学习方法，通过随机将控制权交给较弱模型来确保强模型的解决方案对弱模型保持可理解性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型快速发展，其推理过程对较弱代理和人类来说可能变得难以理解，这会影响可解释性和监督。本文旨在开发能产生对较弱合作者保持可理解性的解决方案的方法。

Method: 引入串联训练范式，在强化学习中随机从冻结的弱模型而非正在训练的强模型采样rollout tokens，只有当强模型的动作和推理过程能被弱模型继续时，rollout才能成功。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理任务中，串联训练能可靠地教会模型放弃专业术语，适应较弱合作伙伴的语言，同时保持高任务准确率。

Conclusion: 串联训练为构建对较弱代理保持可审计性的AI系统提供了一条有前景的路径，对人与AI协作和多智能体通信具有重要意义。

Abstract: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions
and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to
follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term
futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that
remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as
handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model
if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path
does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem
training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which
rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model
rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when
the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak
model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing
standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both
correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem
training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to
weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a
promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents,
with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

Abstract: Logic-based models can be used to build verification tools for machine
learning classifiers employed in the legal field. ML classifiers predict the
outcomes of new cases based on previous ones, thereby performing a form of
case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we introduce a modal logic of
classifiers designed to formally capture legal CBR. We incorporate principles
for resolving conflicts between precedents, by introducing into the logic the
temporal dimension of cases and the hierarchy of courts within the legal
system.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最大化人类赋权（empowerment）的辅助语言模型调优方法Empower，该方法仅需离线文本数据，无需额外人工反馈或可验证奖励，就能训练出更好的辅助AI助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辅助代理方法（如模仿专家或RL微调）往往鼓励代理独立完成任务而非真正协助人类实现目标，且需要昂贵的人工反馈。需要一种更有效、成本更低的辅助AI训练方法。

Method: Empower方法基于最大化人类赋权（影响环境的能力），仅使用离线文本数据进行自监督微调，无需额外人工反馈。

Result: 用户研究中78%的参与者偏好Empower助手（p=0.015），接受率提高31%，建议减少38%。在代码编程环境中，Empower代理使模拟程序员的成功率比SFT基线平均提高192%。

Conclusion: Empower提供了一个仅使用离线数据、无需额外人工反馈或可验证奖励的大规模有用对齐AI代理框架。

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

Conclusion: 分析了步骤级验证性能差的原因、验证器计算规模的影响，以及自验证和验证-生成动态等基本问题。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.
