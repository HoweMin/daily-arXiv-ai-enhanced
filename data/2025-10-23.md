### [1] [3D Optimization for AI Inference Scaling: Balancing Accuracy, Cost, and Latency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18905)
*Minseok Jung,Abhas Ricky,Muhammad Rameez Chatni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个3D优化框架，联合校准AI推理的准确性、成本和延迟，通过多目标优化实现约束感知的推理扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的1D启发式方法和2D双变量权衡无法同时考虑成本和延迟约束，需要更全面的优化方法。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛模拟在三个代表性场景和九个模拟大语言模型上评估四种优化方法，解决3D多目标优化问题。

Result: 膝点优化实现了最佳平衡，当精度优先时准确性最大化方法仍然有利，框架为部署感知的推理扩展建立了理论基础。

Conclusion: 3D多目标优化框架能够捕捉1D和2D优化无法覆盖的可行空间，实现环境自适应的推理扩展参数选择。

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

### [2] [Large Connectome Model: An fMRI Foundation Model of Brain Connectomes Empowered by Brain-Environment Interaction in Multitask Learning Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18910)
*Ziquan Wei,Tingting Dan,Guorong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多任务学习的脑功能图像基础模型，通过标记脑-环境交互进行预训练，并使用伪标签进行半监督微调，在多种神经影像应用中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在临床应用中受限于样本量不足，需要可靠的功能神经影像基础模型来提升性能

Method: 多任务预训练：标记脑-环境交互；半监督微调：使用预训练的BEI伪标签；可扩展的模型架构

Result: 在性别预测、人类行为识别以及自闭症、帕金森病、阿尔茨海默病、精神分裂症等疾病的早期诊断中取得了有前景的结果

Conclusion: 该基础模型在促进神经影像临床应用方面具有巨大潜力

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

### [3] [ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913)
*Wang Zixian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADPO是一个统一框架，扩展了DPO，引入软偏好概率、任意参考策略锚定和列表偏好建模，在噪声环境下显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO假设硬二元标签和成对比较，在存在不确定性和噪声时表现不佳。ADPO旨在通过软偏好、锚定机制和列表建模来解决这些问题

Method: 提出三个关键创新：(1)软偏好概率编码不确定性；(2)任意参考策略锚定提供训练稳定性；(3)Plackett-Luce分布的列表偏好建模。推导出DPO、Bradley-Terry等作为特例

Result: 在上下文赌博机中，锚定使WinMass提升38-63%；KDE平滑在重尾噪声下达到0.68 vs 0.32（112%相对增益）；在顺序RL任务中，锚定在噪声偏好下提升15-29%性能

Conclusion: 推荐使用成对锚定Soft-DPO处理干净或中等噪声数据，使用基于KDE的列表ADPO处理极端污染情况，框架成功从单步扩展到多步设置

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

### [4] [Benchmarking On-Device Machine Learning on Apple Silicon with MLX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18921)
*Oluwaseun A. Ajayi,Ogundepo Odunayo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对苹果硅设备上的MLX框架进行性能评估，重点关注transformer模型的推理延迟，并与PyTorch进行对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和机器学习的广泛应用，需要能够在笔记本电脑和移动设备等小型设备上部署这些模型的框架。MLX框架专门为苹果硅设备的机器学习计算优化而创建。

Method: 创建了MLX-transformers框架，包含MLX中的不同transformer实现，并将PyTorch模型检查点转换为MLX格式。在两种苹果硅MacBook设备上对BERT、RoBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa模型进行基准测试，并与NVIDIA CUDA GPU对比。

Result: 研究结果突显了MLX在苹果生态系统内实现高效且更易访问的端上机器学习应用的潜力。

Conclusion: MLX框架在苹果硅设备上表现出良好的性能，为端上机器学习应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

### [5] [Noise-corrected GRPO: From Noisy Rewards to Unbiased Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18924)
*Omar El mansouri,Mohamed El Amine Seddik,Salem Lahlou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了GRPO和Dr.GRPO框架，通过建模奖励噪声为伯努利噪声并进行噪声校正，提升RLHF在噪声环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF和RLVR对不一致或错误奖励的噪声高度敏感，而现有基于群体的策略优化方法与噪声的交互研究不足。

Method: 引入噪声鲁棒的GRPO框架，将奖励腐败建模为伯努利噪声，通过估计奖励翻转概率进行噪声校正，获得无偏梯度估计。

Result: 在数学和代码任务上获得一致改进，数学任务准确率提升高达6.7个百分点，代码任务提升1.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 将监督学习中的标签噪声校正与现代RLHF结合，为噪声现实部署提供理论洞见和实用算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

### [6] [Application of Reduced-Order Models for Temporal Multiscale Representations in the Prediction of Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18925)
*Elias Al Ghazal,Jad Mounayer,Beatriz Moya,Sebastian Rodriguez,Chady Ghnatios,Francisco Chinesta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了三种多尺度学习方法：基于分区统一方法的神经网络分解、奇异值分解提取主导模态，以及稀疏高阶SVD从有限测量重建多尺度动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂多尺度系统建模的挑战，包括非线性、初始条件敏感性，以及传统机器学习方法无法捕捉高频行为的问题。

Method: 1. 分区统一方法结合神经网络分解动力学；2. 奇异值分解提取宏观和微观尺度主导模态；3. 稀疏高阶SVD从有限测量重建多尺度动力学。

Result: 能够准确捕捉粗粒度和精细动力学，适用于现实世界复杂多尺度现象，并能处理不完整观测的高维系统。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多尺度系统建模问题，提供了所有时间尺度的近似和解释，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

### [7] [BAPO: Stabilizing Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for LLMs via Balanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18927)
*Zhiheng Xi,Xin Guo,Yang Nan,Enyu Zhou,Junrui Shen,Wenxiang Chen,Jiaqi Liu,Jixuan Huang,Zhihao Zhang,Honglin Guo,Xun Deng,Zhikai Lei,Miao Zheng,Guoteng Wang,Shuo Zhang,Peng Sun,Rui Zheng,Hang Yan,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了BAPO方法解决离策略强化学习中策略熵下降、优化不稳定问题，通过动态调整裁剪边界来平衡正负梯度贡献，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离策略强化学习虽然提高了样本效率，但会导致策略熵急剧下降、优化不稳定甚至崩溃，需要解决负优势样本主导和固定裁剪机制抑制探索的问题。

Method: 提出BAPO方法，基于熵裁剪规则动态调整裁剪边界，自适应地重新平衡正负梯度贡献，保持策略熵并稳定优化过程。

Result: 在AIME 2024和2025基准测试中，7B BAPO模型超越开源对手SkyWork-OR1-7B，32B BAPO模型在同等规模模型中达到最先进水平，甚至优于o3-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking等专有系统。

Conclusion: BAPO通过动态裁剪机制有效解决了离策略强化学习中的优化不平衡问题，实现了快速、稳定且数据高效的训练，在大语言模型对齐中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

### [8] [Position: Many generalization measures for deep learning are fragile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18934)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该立场论文指出许多深度神经网络的事后泛化度量是脆弱的——微小的训练修改可能显著改变度量值、趋势或缩放行为，建议新度量开发者应明确审计其脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络的泛化度量难以获得紧致边界，但通常被认为能重现定性泛化趋势。作者质疑这种假设，认为许多事后度量存在脆弱性问题。

Method: 通过实验展示微小超参数调整（如学习率变化或SGD变体切换）如何反转路径范数等广泛使用泛化度量的学习曲线斜率，并识别更微妙的脆弱形式。

Result: 发现路径范数、谱范数、Frobenius范数、平坦度代理和确定性PAC-Bayes代理等许多边界都是脆弱的。PAC-Bayes原点度量虽然对超参数调整不太敏感，但完全无法捕捉数据复杂性差异。

Conclusion: 许多事后泛化度量存在脆弱性问题，新度量开发者应明确审计其脆弱性，而函数基础的边际似然PAC-Bayes边界能捕捉数据复杂性差异，但不是事后度量。

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

### [9] [NeuroAda: Activating Each Neuron's Potential for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18940)
*Zhi Zhang,Yixian Shen,Congfeng Cao,Ekaterina Shutova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAda是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过识别重要参数并引入旁路连接，在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法存在权衡：基于添加的方法（如LoRA）内存效率高但表示能力有限，不适合细粒度适应；选择性原位适应方法能精确适应但内存消耗大。

Method: 首先识别网络中的重要参数，然后为这些选定参数引入旁路连接。微调时仅更新旁路连接，保持原始模型参数冻结。

Result: 在23+个自然语言生成和理解任务上，NeuroAda仅需≤0.02%可训练参数即可达到最先进性能，同时将CUDA内存使用减少高达60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda成功解决了PEFT方法在内存效率和细粒度适应能力之间的权衡问题，提供了一种高效的微调解决方案。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

*Yifei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出对抗性师生蒸馏框架，通过可微分数值求解器监督紧凑神经算子，使用PGD风格主动采样搜索最坏情况输入来扩展训练集，提升神经算子的分布外泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非线性PDE求解器需要精细的时空离散化和局部线性化，导致高内存成本和慢运行速度。神经算子虽然提供快速单次推理，但在分布外泛化方面表现不佳。

Method: 使用可微分谱求解器进行梯度对抗搜索，通过PGD风格主动采样循环在平滑性和能量约束下搜索最坏情况输入来扩展训练集，实现对抗蒸馏。

Result: 在Burgers和Navier-Stokes系统上的实验表明，对抗蒸馏显著提高了分布外鲁棒性，同时保持了神经算子的低参数成本和快速推理优势。

Conclusion: 对抗蒸馏框架有效解决了神经算子的分布外泛化问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的编码-分解范式，通过将编码表示分解为稳定和辅助表示，增强在污染时间序列训练时的鲁棒性，并使用基于互信息的新度量替代重构误差来识别异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自编码器在时间序列异常检测中广泛应用，但其学习到的表示对训练时间序列中的异常敏感，导致准确性降低。需要提高在污染训练数据下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出编码-分解范式：将编码表示分解为稳定表示和辅助表示；使用基于互信息的新度量替代重构误差进行异常识别。

Result: 在8个常用的多变量和单变量时间序列基准测试中表现出竞争性或最先进的性能，对不同污染率的时间序列展现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的编码-分解范式和基于互信息的异常度量方法有效提升了时间序列异常检测在污染训练数据下的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

### [12] [Natural Gradient VI: Guarantees for Non-Conjugate Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19163)
*Fangyuan Sun,Ilyas Fatkhullin,Niao He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对随机自然梯度变分推断（NGVI）的理论基础进行了深入研究，特别是在非共轭似然情况下。作者提出了满足相对平滑性的充分条件，设计了改进的NGVI算法并证明了其全局收敛性，并在特定结构假设下揭示了变分损失的隐藏凸性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NGVI在经验上很成功，但其理论基础仍然有限，特别是在非共轭似然情况下。现有收敛保证仅适用于共轭模型，无法扩展到非共轭设置，其中变分损失变得非凸且更难分析。

Method: 采用均值场参数化，首先推导变分损失满足相对平滑性的充分条件；然后提出包含非欧几里得投影的改进NGVI算法；最后在特定结构假设下分析变分损失的隐藏凸性。

Result: 证明了改进NGVI算法的全局非渐近收敛到驻点；在额外结构假设下建立了NGVI快速全局收敛到全局最优解的结果；为NGVI在挑战性推断设置中的几何和收敛行为提供了新见解。

Conclusion: 这项工作显著推进了对NGVI的理论理解，特别是在非共轭设置下，为变分推断的收敛行为提供了新的几何洞察和理论保证。

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗实践依赖标准化治疗框架和经验方法，忽视患者个体差异，导致次优健康结果，需要个性化医疗方案。

Method: 使用LLM处理非结构化医疗文本为结构化数据，CTGAN生成合成患者数据，T-learner预测个体治疗反应，上下文bandit优化在线治疗选择。

Result: LLM处理准确率93.2%，CTGAN生成数据55%准确率，T-learner预测准确率84.3%，KernelUCB在5000轮中获得0.60-0.61平均奖励分数。

Conclusion: 该系统克服了在线学习环境的冷启动限制，提高了计算效率，在个性化医疗方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to
suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks
(CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to
provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured
datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient
data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast
patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000
rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes
cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine
adapted to specific patient characteristics.

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了通信效率和协调性能，为通信受限的多智能体强化学习提供了理论保证和实用框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一个理论框架，解释人工神经网络中类别学习如何导致类别边界附近的神经表征扩展，这是通过最大化类别与神经活动之间的互信息来实现的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动物和人工神经网络中观察到的类别感知现象，即类别学习会增强类别边界附近的刺激辨别能力，从理论上解释这一现象的必要性。

Method: 扩展理论框架到人工网络，通过最小化贝叶斯成本（交叉熵损失均值）来最大化类别与决策层前神经活动的互信息，并分析Fisher信息矩阵在投影空间中的行为。

Result: 发现最优学习使神经Fisher信息遵循类别特定的Fisher信息，导致类别边界附近的神经空间扩展，且最大值通常不在边界上而是在边界附近。

Conclusion: 类别学习通过最大化互信息诱导神经表征在决策边界附近的扩展，建立了与信息瓶颈方法的联系，并展示了贝叶斯成本的偏差-方差分解。

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

TL;DR: 将机器遗忘重新定义为多目标优化问题，提出CUP算法通过梯度枢轴机制可控地导航帕累托前沿，使用单一超参数"遗忘强度"精确控制遗忘效果与模型保真度的权衡。

Method: 提出CUP算法，采用独特的枢轴机制，通过单一超参数"遗忘强度"可控地导航整个帕累托前沿，而非传统多目标优化方法收敛到单一解。

Conclusion: 将机器遗忘重新定义为多目标优化问题，并通过CUP算法实现了对遗忘过程的可控导航，为机器遗忘提供了更精细的控制和评估框架。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型决策树泛化方法——形状泛化树(SGT)，通过在每个内部节点应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数，实现非线性分割，在保持可解释性的同时提升性能并减小模型规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策树依赖简单的轴对齐线性分割，需要深度复杂的结构来捕捉非线性特征效应，这削弱了人类对构建树的理解。

Method: 提出SGT框架，每个内部节点对单个特征应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数；开发ShapeCART算法学习SGT；扩展为双变量形状函数(S²GT)和多路树(SGT_K)。

Result: 在各种数据集上的实验表明，SGT相比传统轴对齐线性树实现了更优的性能，同时减少了模型规模。

Conclusion: SGT通过引入可学习的形状函数，在保持决策树可解释性的同时，显著提升了非线性建模能力，实现了性能与模型复杂度的更好平衡。

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习后门攻击方法采用基于规则的层选择，未考虑层间相互关系，导致攻击效果不佳且容易被先进防御检测。

Method: 提出POLAR框架，使用强化学习动态学习攻击策略，通过策略梯度更新优化层选择，并引入正则化约束限制修改层数以保持隐蔽性。

Result: 实验表明POLAR在对抗六种最先进防御方法时，比最新攻击方法性能提升高达40%。

Conclusion: POLAR证明了强化学习在联邦学习后门攻击中的有效性，能够动态优化层选择策略，在保持隐蔽性的同时实现高攻击成功率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过大规模实证研究发现，Maximal Update Parameterization (muP) 的学习率缩放规则只在训练初期有效，而权重衰减才是真正稳定内部表示更新动态、实现学习率迁移的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究muP学习率缩放规则的有效性，探索在大型神经网络训练中实现学习率迁移的实际机制，因为超参数调优在大型模型训练中成本极高。

Method: 进行大规模实证调查，分析muP假设在实际训练场景（如LLM训练）中的有效性，比较muP和权重衰减对内部表示更新动态的影响。

Result: 发现muP的假设仅在训练初期成立，而权重衰减在整个训练过程中都能正确稳定不同宽度模型的更新动态，muP主要起到隐式学习率预热的作用。

Conclusion: 这些发现挑战了关于学习率迁移的普遍认知，解释了为什么muP需要独立权重衰减变体才能成功迁移，并表明可以通过修改预热计划来替代muP。

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决课程学习在LLMs中何时有效、哪种方向更好以及答案是否取决于评估指标等基本问题，因为现有研究使用不同的难度指标和训练设置。

Method: 使用统一的离线评估框架，将课程难度分解为五个维度：问题难度、模型惊讶度、置信度边际、预测不确定性和决策变异性，在数学推理基准上对Llama3.1-8B、Mistral-7B和Gemma3-4B进行受控后训练实验。

Result: 发现(i)没有统一的课程策略，(ii)同一指标内不同难度样本根据任务需求产生不同收益，(iii)任务对齐课程关注最终表示和泛化，而内部状态课程调节置信度和不确定性等内部状态。

Conclusion: 挑战了通用课程策略的概念，为不同模型和任务提供了可操作指导，某些指标表明优先处理决策不确定样本可以进一步提升学习效果。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

TL;DR: MetaCluster框架通过元学习和聚类技术，显著压缩Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks的参数存储，实现高达80倍的压缩率且不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs通过用基系数向量替换标量权重提高了表达能力，但导致参数和内存呈倍数增长，需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器将低维嵌入映射到系数向量，使其位于低维流形上，然后通过K-means聚类用共享质心替换每边向量，最后微调质心码本。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，MetaCluster实现了高达80倍的参数存储减少，且精度无损失。

Conclusion: MetaCluster成功解决了KANs参数爆炸问题，证明了向量化参数的可压缩性，为高效神经网络设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

Method: 采用上下文线性赌博机框架，提出不确定性引导的探索算法，通过调节参数在遗憾最小化与估计误差之间实现任意权衡。

Result: 在合成网络数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于静态方法和忽略这种权衡的上下文赌博机方法。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了学习同伴影响力概率时的基本权衡关系，提出的算法能够灵活平衡探索与利用，为信息扩散建模和营销策略优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

Motivation: 现有可控音乐生成方法通常需要模型重新训练或会产生可听伪影，需要一种能够对冻结预训练模型进行精细控制而不影响生成质量的方法。

Method: 使用RFM分析模型内部梯度，发现音乐属性对应的概念方向，训练轻量级RFM探针发现隐藏状态中的方向，在推理时将其注入模型进行实时引导。

Conclusion: MusicRFM成功平衡了控制与生成质量之间的权衡，为音乐领域的RFM应用提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有竞争优势

Conclusion: InvarGC能够有效处理存在潜在混杂因素和环境异质性的情况，建立了在这些条件下的可识别性

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 使用GPT-2构建师生实验设置，系统研究潜意识腐败的缩放规律、阈值和机制，包括行为分析、相变检测和可解释性分析。

Result: 实验发现三个关键结果：1）潜意识腐败导致行为交叉，降低模型整体对齐性；2）对齐性在污染数据临界阈值处发生急剧相变；3）腐败机制模仿自然微调过程，难以检测。

Conclusion: 结果表明依赖合成数据的AI系统存在关键脆弱性，需要能够考虑潜在威胁的新安全协议。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

Motivation: 解决模型微调中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是当下游领域数据有限或与预训练分布差异较大时，现有参数高效微调方法在权重空间操作可能导致模型过度专业化，覆盖预训练知识。

Method: 提出特征空间适配方法，包括LoRFA（低秩特征适配）和VeFA（基于向量的特征适配），通过轻量级特征级变换补偿下游潜变量的影响，保持预训练表示。

Result: 在图像分类、自然语言理解和生成任务上评估，特征空间适配方法在标准微调指标上表现相当，但在鲁棒性方面持续更强。

Conclusion: 特征空间适配能有效保留预训练知识，提高模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力，是解决灾难性遗忘问题的有效途径。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整合多样化数据对改善科学探索至关重要。该研究旨在建立能够编码视频和文本输入的视觉语言模型，以准确分类小鼠在环境中的各种行为，为跨学科研究人员提供全面的行为数据集。

Method: 使用开源Qwen2.5-VL模型，通过提示工程、上下文学习(ICL)使用标记示例和帧级预处理来增强模型性能，无需进行模型微调。

Result: 每种方法都能改善分类性能，组合使用时在所有行为类别（包括罕见的冻结和逃跑行为）上都获得了较高的F1分数，能够为每个受试者和每次实验生成准确的行为向量时间序列。

Conclusion: 该模型将支持跨学科研究人员研究小鼠行为，使他们能够整合跨多个时间点和环境测量的多样化行为特征，构建能够解决复杂研究问题的综合数据集。

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

TL;DR: 多任务后训练中存在梯度不平衡问题，大梯度任务主导优化过程，但梯度大小与学习收益不成正比，需要梯度级别的校正方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务后训练通常假设所有任务贡献相似幅度的梯度，但研究发现RL后训练中某些任务产生显著更大的梯度，导致优化偏向这些任务，而梯度大小与学习收益并不相关。

Method: 通过分析不同任务在RL后训练中的梯度大小和学习收益，研究梯度不平衡现象及其与训练统计量（如训练奖励或优势）的关系。

Result: 发现大梯度任务可以实现相似甚至更低的学习收益，梯度不平衡不能由典型训练统计量解释，表明其源于任务间的固有差异。

Conclusion: 需要避免简单的数据集混合，呼吁未来研究开发基于梯度级别的校正方法来解决LLMs中的梯度不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

Motivation: 传统基于扩散的GNN模拟被动热扩散，存在过平滑问题且难以捕获全局图信息。受宇宙热寂理论启发，认识到在封闭系统中节点表示会随时间收敛到相同特征向量。

Result: 在多个图任务上与最先进的GNN模型对比，ADGNN在准确性和效率上均有显著提升，能有效捕获全局图信息并保持节点独特性。

Conclusion: ADGNN通过主动扩散机制成功克服了传统GNN的过平滑问题，在保持节点独特性的同时高效获取图的全局结构信息，在多个任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Motivation: 理解时间序列基础模型训练过程中各种"旋钮"如何影响模型质量，而非开发新模型声称优于现有模型。通过理论和实证评估揭示设计选择导致的隐性偏差。

Method: 采用理论分析和受控实证评估相结合的方法，识别关键设计选择（补丁大小、嵌入选择、训练目标等），并分析它们如何影响模型的基本属性。

Result: 发现设计选择会导致模型在时间行为、几何结构和回归均值倾向等方面产生隐性偏差，这些偏差可能直观也可能违反直觉，取决于模型和数据的特性。

Conclusion: 通过异常值处理的案例研究展示了多个偏差如何复杂交互，讨论了这些结果对学习"苦涩教训"和构建时间序列基础模型的意义。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

TL;DR: SPOT是一种新颖的强化学习方法，通过混合整数线性规划优化决策树策略，显著提高了可解释性策略的计算效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险决策中，可解释的强化学习策略至关重要，但在马尔可夫决策过程中优化决策树策略仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 将优化问题建模为混合整数线性规划，采用降维分支定界方法，将MDP动态与树结构约束解耦，实现高效并行搜索。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，SPOT实现了显著加速，可扩展到具有更多状态的更大MDP，生成的可解释决策树策略紧凑且性能不妥协。

Conclusion: 该方法同时实现了可解释性和可扩展性，比现有方法快一个数量级地提供高质量策略。

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了SILVER with RL-guided labeling，通过将RL策略自身动作输出纳入边界点识别，将SILVER框架扩展到多动作和高维环境，提升深度强化学习的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习虽然性能卓越但缺乏可解释性，限制了对其策略行为的信任。现有的SILVER框架仅限于低维、二元动作领域。

Method: 首先从图像观察中提取紧凑特征表示，进行SHAP特征归因，然后使用RL引导标记生成行为一致的边界数据集，最后训练决策树和回归函数等替代模型来解释RL策略的决策结构。

Result: 在两个Atari环境中使用三种深度RL算法进行评估，并通过人类主体研究评估了可解释策略的清晰度和可信度。结果表明该方法在保持竞争性任务性能的同时，显著提高了透明度和人类对智能体行为的理解。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过将SILVER转变为可扩展且行为感知的框架，推进了可解释RL在高维多动作设置中解释深度RL智能体的能力。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

Motivation: 人类具有根据相似性对对象进行分组的先天能力，聚类算法旨在模拟这种认知机制。最近在社区检测方面的进展使得能够在多个分辨率尺度上发现有效的层次聚类配置，而无需标记数据。

Method: 引入GraMixC模块，该模块提取配置，使用反向合并/拆分（RMS）技术对齐它们，并通过注意力头融合它们，然后将其转发到任何下游预测器。

Result: 在DSN1 16S rRNA培养介质预测任务中，GraMixC将R2分数从0.6提高到0.9，在多个方法中创造了新的最先进水平。在标准表格基准测试中，它始终优于单分辨率和静态特征基线。

Conclusion: 配置表现出较低的冗余性，并且无需临时选择。它们可以通过无监督或自监督方法学习，但其选择或组合仍然特定于下游任务和输入。

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

Conclusion: FnRGNN为图神经网络节点回归任务提供了一个有效的多级公平性框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet
fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly
target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities
without sacrificing performance. Code is available at

Conclusion: 注意力知识可以有效迁移到循环模型中，为快速利用Transformer专业知识构建更强的SSM社区提供了可行途径。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

Motivation: 深度集成虽然能提供最先进的不确定性量化，但计算和内存需求大，难以部署到实际应用中。传统知识蒸馏在压缩集成时难以保持不确定性，特别是当DNN尺寸减小时会导致变异减少。

Method: 使用深度潜在因子模型（DLF）将教师集成视为随机过程的实现，通过期望最大化（EM）算法稳定估计DLF模型的均值和协方差函数，实现从教师集成到学生分布的压缩。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，高斯蒸馏方法优于现有基线方法，并且在语言模型微调和分布偏移问题上也表现良好。

Conclusion: 高斯蒸馏提供了一种有效的分布蒸馏方法，能够更好地保持集成模型的不确定性特性，同时实现模型压缩，适用于实际部署场景。

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,

Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: QiMeng-SALV通过信号级优化解决了功能奖励不足的问题，为Verilog代码生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

### [43] [Foundation Model Forecasts: Form and Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19345)
*Alvaro Perez-Diaz,James C. Loach,Danielle E. Toutoungi,Lee Middleton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文指出时间序列基础模型虽然预测准确，但预测形式（点预测、分位数预测、参数预测或轨迹集成）限制了其实际应用价值。研究发现三分之二的模型只产生点或参数预测，而许多操作任务需要保留时间依赖性的轨迹集成预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型主要关注预测准确性，但忽略了预测形式对实际应用任务的支持能力。许多操作任务需要轨迹集成预测来保留时间依赖性，而现有模型大多无法提供这种预测形式。

Method: 通过调查近期时间序列基础模型，分析不同预测类型之间的转换可能性，证明边际分布无法确定路径依赖事件概率，并将六种基本预测任务映射到最小充分预测类型。

Result: 研究发现轨迹集成可以转换为更简单的形式，但反向转换需要施加时间依赖性；边际分布相同的无限多联合分布对操作问题给出不同答案；提出了任务对齐的评估框架。

Conclusion: 预测类型而非准确性决定了实际效用，需要根据具体操作任务选择合适的预测形式，轨迹集成预测对于许多实际应用任务至关重要。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

TL;DR: 提出Loopholing机制，通过确定性隐式路径保留离散扩散模型中的分布信息，显著提升文本生成质量，缩小与自回归模型的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在并行解码方面有优势，但存在采样墙问题：一旦进行类别采样，丰富的分布信息就会坍缩为one-hot向量，无法在步骤间传播，导致后续步骤信息受限。

Method: 引入Loopholing机制，通过确定性隐式路径保留分布信息，结合自条件训练策略，构建Loopholing离散扩散模型(LDDMs)。

Result: 将生成困惑度降低高达61%，缩小甚至超越与自回归模型的差距，生成更连贯的文本，在Countdown和Game of 24等算术推理任务上性能提升。

Conclusion: Loopholing机制缓解了空闲步骤和振荡问题，为非自回归文本生成提供了可扩展的高质量路径。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

Motivation: 传统物种监测方法覆盖范围有限，物种分布模型(SDM)有助于填补这些空白。本研究旨在利用深度学习和数据预处理技术提高青蛙物种分布预测的准确性，以支持更精确的生物多样性监测。

Method: 采用深度学习和数据插补技术，包括数据平衡、特征选择和多模态集成模型，整合土地覆盖、NDVI和其他环境变量，融合图像和表格数据。

Result: 数据平衡将青蛙计数任务的MAE从189降至29；多模态集成模型在栖息地分类中达到84.9%准确率和0.90 AUC；特征选择识别出关键环境因素，在保持预测准确性的同时优化输入。

Conclusion: 多模态学习和数据预处理技术（如平衡和插补）能够显著改善生态预测模型，特别是在数据稀疏或不完整的情况下，为更精确和可扩展的生物多样性监测做出贡献。

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

TL;DR: FairNet是一个用于动态、实例级公平性校正的新框架，通过集成偏置检测器和条件低秩适配器，仅在识别为偏置的实例上激活公平性校正机制，从而在保持无偏实例性能的同时提升公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法往往牺牲性能、依赖静态校正策略、难以处理数据稀疏问题，特别是少数群体数据稀疏，且对敏感属性的利用不够优化。

Method: FairNet框架包含偏置检测器和条件LoRA模块，使用新的对比损失函数训练LoRA模块，最小化不同敏感群体间的类内表示差异，并能灵活处理完整、部分或缺失的敏感属性标签场景。

Result: 理论分析表明，在偏置检测器具有中等TPR/FPR的情况下，FairNet能够提升最差群体的性能而不降低整体模型性能，甚至可能带来轻微性能提升。多基准测试验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FairNet提供了一种动态、实例级的公平性校正方法，在保持性能的同时有效提升模型公平性，并能灵活适应不同的敏感属性标签可用性场景。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

Conclusion: NVDPs能够稳健地近似任务特定的丢弃率，处理广泛的功能模糊性和不确定性，实现全局学习共享神经网络在新任务中的快速重新配置

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

Conclusion: REBMBO有效克服了传统贝叶斯优化的局限性，在复杂优化任务中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: Scalable LinUCB算法显著降低了线性上下文赌博机的计算和内存需求，为大规模推荐系统提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

Conclusion: 联邦聚类方法能够有效分析分布式分子数据，但需要结合领域特定指标和可解释性分析来获得有意义的化学洞见。

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

Motivation: 深度学习惯性跟踪系统存在隐私泄露风险，现有差分隐私方案因引入过多噪声而影响模型性能，特别是在高频惯性测量中。

Method: 使用ConvNeXt块与Transformer编码器的混合架构，结合自适应梯度裁剪和梯度对齐噪声注入的差分隐私机制，利用截断奇异值分解进行梯度处理。

Result: 在OxIOD、RIDI、RoNIN等基准数据集上，ConvXformer超越现有方法，定位精度提升超过40%，同时保证(ε,δ)-差分隐私。在KAIST机械工程大楼收集的Mech-IO数据集上验证了在严重环境干扰下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架在保证隐私安全的同时显著提升了惯性导航性能，适用于网络物理系统中的安全智能导航。

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly

Motivation: 解决医疗AI中由于隐私限制导致真实电子健康记录数据难以获取，从而限制模型在人口亚组层面进行可信评估的问题。

Method: 在现有扩散和VAE生成器基础上，引入Enhanced TimeAutoDiff，通过分布对齐惩罚增强潜在扩散目标。

Result: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff将真实-合成评估差距减少70%以上，在32个交叉亚组中，大型合成队列将亚组级AUROC估计误差减少高达50%。

Conclusion: 该工作为重症监护提供了实用、保护隐私的可信模型评估路线图，能够在不同患者群体中进行稳健可靠的性能分析。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

TL;DR: 提出一种从多变量时间序列中提取系统'年龄'代理特征的方法，通过优化公式的单调性来发现潜在特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多系统会随时间老化或退化，但传感器数据中可能没有直接的'年龄'信息。需要从现有传感器数据中发现能代表系统'年龄'的代理特征。

Method: 使用精心定义的语法生成候选公式，通过优化这些公式与时间之间的Spearman秩相关系数的绝对值来评估单调性，从而发现高单调性的潜在特征。

Result: 在人工生成数据集和两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法能将低单调性的传感器组合成高单调性的潜在特征。在InfraWatch结构健康监测项目中，两个Spearman ρ值分别为0.13和0.09的特征被组合成ρ值为0.95的代理特征。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够找到可解释的方程，这些方程可以作为系统'年龄'的有效代理特征。

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAligner是一个动态、质量感知的图-文本对齐框架，通过实时评估监督质量来动态调整多对多和一对一对齐策略，解决了现有方法在噪声监督下的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP风格的图-文本对齐方法存在两个关键限制：假设严格的节点-文本一对一对应关系，忽略了现实图中固有的多对多关系；依赖无法适应不同数据质量的静态对齐目标，在噪声监督下表现脆弱。

Method: ADAligner框架实时估计批次级别的对齐可靠性，并根据监督质量动态调整优化策略：在监督干净时促进软性的子图级别多对多对齐，在噪声下通过动态过滤低置信度对来强调可靠的一对一对齐。

Result: 在九个不同的TAG数据集上的综合实验表明，ADAligner在零样本/少样本节点分类、链接预测和跨模态检索任务上持续优于先前的图-文本对齐方法。在噪声监督下保持强鲁棒性，相比多模态基线加速预训练约2-3倍。

Conclusion: ADAligner为现实网络环境中的图-文本表示学习建立了可扩展且可靠的基础，通过动态对齐机制解决了表达性与鲁棒性之间的核心困境。

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

Motivation: 传统基于像素重建的世界模型与规划目标不一致，强像素重建不一定对应好的规划决策。需要预测任务相关的语义信息而非像素。

Result: 在开放端机器人任务上实现了策略改进，相比基于重建的世界模型获得了显著的泛化改进。

Conclusion: 语义世界模型通过预测任务相关语义信息而非像素，能够更好地支持决策规划，并继承预训练视觉语言模型的泛化和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

Motivation: 现有SVD方法统一处理整个参数矩阵，忽略了不同矩阵部分SVD近似误差的显著差异，导致压缩效果不理想。

Method: CPSVD识别并直接保留高分解误差的矩阵列，仅对低分解误差列应用SVD，并自适应地为LLM中不同模块分配非均匀压缩率。

Result: 大量实验表明CPSVD在零样本任务上始终优于最先进的基于SVD的LLM压缩方法，获得更低的困惑度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: CPSVD通过智能矩阵分割和自适应压缩率分配，显著提升了SVD在LLM压缩中的性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法存在局限性：启发式算法搜索空间受限，基于掩码的训练难以高效捕捉奇异值谱与可训练参数关系，且忽视增益函数在压缩比为1时的非光滑特性，导致训练陷入局部最优

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B模型80%压缩比下，WikiText2困惑度从8.38降至6.42，零样本任务平均准确率相比均匀压缩提升9.72个百分点

Conclusion: ARA方法在SVD-based LLM压缩中有效解决了秩分配问题，实现了全局最优的压缩性能

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

Conclusion: IFeF-PINN通过傅里叶特征增强有效克服频谱偏差，显著提升高频PDE的逼近精度。

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

Motivation: 现有遗忘方法依赖梯度上升来降低特定目标响应的概率，但会导致概率质量重新分布到高似然区域（语义相关的改写），产生虚假遗忘问题。

Method: 提出引导框架，将挤压效应与模型自身高置信度生成（模型信念）联系起来。BS-T抑制高概率token，BS-S移除整个高置信度生成，联合抑制目标响应和模型信念。

Conclusion: 通过直接对抗挤压效应，提出的引导框架在语言模型遗忘任务中取得了更好的效果，解决了现有方法导致的虚假遗忘问题。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Method: 在不同数据集上测试对抗性鲁棒模型的表示相似性和预测行为，分析分类层对预测差异的影响，通过重新训练分类器来验证预测行为能否实现更高普适性。

Result: 在特定设置下验证了Jones关于高表示相似性的主要主张，但结果在不同数据集间不一致；预测行为不会随鲁棒性增加而收敛；预测差异主要源于分类层；通过重新训练分类器可以实现更普适的预测行为。

Conclusion: 神经网络在特定设置下具有部分普适性，但不存在严格的普适性概念，预测行为可以通过分类器重新训练实现更高程度的普适性。

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

*Xin Nie,Liang Dong,HaiCheng Zhang,JiaWang Xiao,G. Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELUTQ是一个高效的量化框架，通过引入分层线性量化（HLQ）格式，在CPU边缘设备上优化大型语言模型的部署，显著降低内存使用和延迟，同时保持推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CPU边缘设备上部署大型语言模型面临内存和计算资源有限的挑战，现有硬件友好的均匀量化方法无法很好地适应权重分布，且在低比特宽度下反量化开销较大。

Method: 提出ELUTQ框架，引入分层线性量化（HLQ）格式，该格式能更好地捕捉权重的统计特性，同时不增加基于位串行查找表的GEMM操作的计算成本，从而消除反量化开销。

Result: 实验表明，对于LLaMA3-8B模型，HLQ在3位精度下将困惑度降低约8%，在2位精度下降低85%，量化过程在一小时内完成。在推理效率方面，2位LLaMA2-7B在Apple M2芯片上达到超过25 tokens/s的速度。

Conclusion: ELUTQ框架通过HLQ量化格式有效解决了边缘设备上LLM部署的内存和延迟瓶颈，提供了一种高效且易于集成的量化解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

TL;DR: SpikeQuant是一种结合脉冲神经网络和混合精度量化的方法，通过将激活值重新编码为二进制脉冲计数，在W4A4量化下实现接近FP16的精度，同时将能耗降低4.6倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在边缘设备部署时的三个主要挑战：MAC操作能耗高、反量化引入额外开销、均匀位宽量化会损失重要值。

Method: 选择性对重要激活值应用混合精度量化，将其重新编码为二进制脉冲计数，并通过将量化尺度嵌入IF机制的阈值来避免显式反量化。

Result: 在W4A4量化下持续实现接近FP16的困惑度，同时能耗比现有方法降低高达4.6倍。

Conclusion: SpikeQuant为准确且节能的LLM部署提供了有效解决方案，特别适合能量受限的硬件环境。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模型一致性方法，通过结合来自不同训练数据、训练方案和模型架构的多个LLM的响应，在幻觉检测和缓解方面显著优于单模型一致性方法，同时还能降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单模型一致性方法虽然能缓解LLM幻觉问题，但仍受限于单个模型的训练数据不完美、偏见和信息不足等问题。

Method: 扩展单模型一致性方法，将来自多个不同LLM（共15个模型）的响应进行组合，形成"联盟一致性"方法，并探索不同模型组合的条件。

Result: 多模型一致性方法在幻觉检测和缓解能力上取得了显著提升，且通常伴随着推理成本的降低。

Conclusion: 通过组合多个不同LLM的响应，可以显著提升幻觉检测和缓解性能，同时克服单模型一致性方法的高推理成本问题。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

TL;DR: 提出Bi-level Decision-Focused Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL)方法，解决在线平台营销中的预测-决策错位和偏差-方差权衡问题，通过双层优化框架结合实验和观测数据，已在美团大规模部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两阶段方法存在预测-决策错位问题，ML只关注预测精度而忽略下游优化目标；同时面临偏差-方差困境，观测数据有偏差而实验数据稀缺且成本高。

Method: 开发基于实验数据的无偏OR决策质量估计器，通过代理损失函数连接离散优化梯度；建立双层优化框架，结合观测和实验数据，使用隐式微分求解。

Result: 在公开基准、工业营销数据集和大规模在线A/B测试中验证了有效性，相比现有方法有显著统计改进，已在美团平台成功部署。

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL通过决策导向的因果学习方法，系统性解决了营销优化中的关键挑战，实现了最优的偏差-方差权衡，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于多臂老虎机的乐观面对不确定性和汤普森采样方法在实际应用中存在局限性，需要替代方案来处理未知动态的线性系统控制问题。

Method: 利用LQR策略结构、灵敏度分析和稳定性分析，开发MED-LQ控制策略，将混淆实例原则和最小经验散度算法扩展到大规模设置。

Result: 在综合控制套件上的基准测试表明，MED-LQ在各种场景下实现了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: MED-LQ展示了在大型马尔可夫决策过程中更广泛应用潜力，为未知动态线性系统控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在传染病爆发预测中应用广泛，但针对地方性疾病的预测研究不足，特别是RSV疫情预测。

Method: 基于XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM的集成模型，结合高分辨率特征学习和长程时间依赖捕捉机制，通过自回归模块训练气候控制的滞后关系，使用随机推理返回概率区间。

Result: 在美国34个州的评估中，ForecastNet-XCL在州内和跨州场景中均可靠地优于统计基线、单个神经网络和传统集成方法，在延长预测时间范围内保持准确性。

Conclusion: ForecastNet-XCL的效率、性能和不确定性感知设计使其成为在气候压力加剧和监测资源受限情况下的可部署预警工具。

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

TL;DR: DiffEvac是一种基于生成模型的建筑疏散模拟新方法，使用扩散模型从模拟疏散热图中学习疏散模式，相比传统方法显著提升效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疏散模拟依赖精细建模和大量参数，难以在早期设计阶段进行快速迭代，需要更高效的模拟方法。

Method: 建立399个不同功能布局的数据集，提出解耦特征表示方法嵌入物理特征，基于图像提示的扩散模型学习疏散模式。

Result: 相比条件GAN方法，SSIM提升37.6%，PSNR提升142%，速度提升16倍，模拟时间缩短至2分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升设计迭代效率，为智能建筑安全优化提供新思路，降低建模负担并支持大规模假设探索。

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

Motivation: 最小二乘法在现代机器学习中的潜力远未被充分发掘，不仅限于线性模型拟合，应该将其发展为可微分算子以支持更广泛的应用。

Method: 推导自定义梯度，将最小二乘求解器转化为可微分算子，使其能够像神经网络层一样工作。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发可微分线性代数工具的重要进展，使这些工具能够更广泛地被机器学习从业者使用。

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a
tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom
gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a
neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA变体缺乏明确区分任务相关信息与残差信息的机制，限制了在下游任务中的性能表现。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习两个独立的潜在空间，通过新颖的证据下界公式促进潜在空间之间的因子分解，一个空间专门处理任务显著特征，另一个处理残差信息。

Result: 在文本、音频和图像任务上的广泛实验表明，FVAE-LoRA始终优于标准LoRA。虚假相关性评估证实该方法能更好地隔离任务相关信号，在分布偏移下具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA通过明确的因子分解机制有效提升了LoRA在下游任务中的性能，并增强了模型对分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间变化设置中估计异质性处理效应面临严重挑战，因为某些处理序列的观测概率随预测时间范围呈指数下降，导致数据支持不足和严重的重叠问题。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的Neyman正交总体风险函数，最小化重叠加权的oracle风险，构建了重叠加权正交元学习器，该方法是完全模型无关的。

Result: 通过使用transformer和LSTM骨干网络的广泛实验，证明了新WO学习器的优势，能够抵消现有元学习器的不稳定性，获得更可靠的HTE估计。

Conclusion: 提出的WO学习器具有Neyman正交性的有利特性，对nuisance函数的错误设定具有鲁棒性，能够有效解决时间变化设置中的重叠问题。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

Motivation: 现有策略学习方法在预测不确定时仍强制决策，这在高风险场景中很危险。需要允许策略在不确定时弃权，选择安全默认选项。

Method: 提出两阶段学习器：首先识别一组近似最优策略，然后基于它们的分歧构建弃权规则。使用双重稳健目标处理未知倾向得分情况。

Result: 在已知倾向得分时获得O(1/n)型快速遗憾保证，扩展到未知倾向得分情况。弃权工具可改善边界条件下的性能，连接分布鲁棒策略学习，支持安全策略改进。

Conclusion: 弃权是策略学习中的多功能工具，能在不确定时提供安全机制，同时提升其他核心问题的性能保证，具有广泛的应用价值。

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法通常只使用单个草稿模型，但实际应用中存在多个潜在草稿模型，从快速但不准确到慢速但可靠不等。如何有效利用这些模型来进一步降低推理延迟是研究动机。

Method: HSD将多个草稿模型堆叠成层次结构，每个模型提出token，下一个更大的模型在单次前向传播中验证这些token，最终由目标模型验证所有token。算法推导了任意此类层次结构的期望延迟表达式，并证明可以在多项式时间内选择延迟最优的层次结构。

Result: 实验表明，HSD相比最佳单草稿基线可获得高达1.2倍的加速，证明了该算法在减少生成延迟方面的实用性。

Conclusion: 分层推测解码通过有效利用多个草稿模型的层次结构，能够显著降低Transformer语言模型的推理延迟，超越了以往的技术方法。

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

Conclusion: SEMPO显著减少了预训练数据规模和模型大小，同时实现了强大的泛化性能，为资源受限环境中的时间序列预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available

Result: 证明当迭代次数增长为t ≳ d^{1+δ}时SGD迭代满足CLT，运行时间为O(td)，内存需求为O(d)，优于现有方法的O(td² + d³)。

Conclusion: 这些结果为在接近最优缩放机制t ≳ d^{1+δ}下构建SGD迭代的置信区间提供了首个完全在线和数据驱动的框架。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

<details>

Motivation: 现有深度学习物种分布模型在处理复杂异构数据时表现良好，但受限于数据的空间偏差，需要更有效的方法来结合局部观察与生态模式

Method: 引入BATIS框架，采用贝叶斯深度学习方法，迭代更新先验预测，同时捕捉任意性和认知不确定性，在eBird公民科学观测数据集上进行基准测试

Result: 贝叶斯深度学习方法能显著提高物种分布模型在数据稀缺地区的可靠性，有助于生态理解和保护工作

Conclusion: BATIS框架通过贝叶斯方法有效解决了物种分布模型中的空间数据偏差问题，为生态监测和保护提供了更可靠的工具

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

*Qilin Ye,Deqing Fu,Robin Jia,Vatsal Sharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文解释了Transformer在算法学习上的局限性，证明其只能学习直径不超过3^L的图连通性问题，超出此范围会退化为基于节点度的启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在学习通用算法时往往依赖脆弱的启发式方法而非真正的算法，本文旨在从理论和实验上解释这一现象。

Method: 使用简化的解耦Transformer架构，分析其训练动态，证明L层模型最多能解决直径3^L的图连通性问题，相当于计算邻接矩阵的幂。

Result: 当训练数据在模型容量内时，Transformer能学习正确的算法；超出容量时，会退化为基于节点度的启发式方法。限制训练数据在容量内可使模型学习精确算法。

Conclusion: Transformer的算法学习能力受限于其模型容量，适当限制训练数据范围可促进其学习真正的算法而非启发式方法。

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

TL;DR: CONFEX是一种新颖的不确定性感知反事实解释方法，结合了共形预测和混合整数线性规划，为模型预测提供具有局部覆盖保证的可靠解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法往往忽视预测不确定性，缺乏将不确定性纳入解释的机制和形式化保证，导致解释可能不可靠或误导。

Method: 使用共形预测和混合整数线性规划，通过离线树基输入空间分区开发局部化CP程序，实现高效的MILP编码。

Result: 在多个基准测试和指标上优于现有方法，产生更鲁棒和合理的解释。

Conclusion: CONFEX能够生成具有预测不确定性和最优性严格保证的反事实解释，解决了CFX生成违反可交换性的问题。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需参考模型即可评估模型对成员推理攻击脆弱性的新方法，通过分析训练和测试损失分布的不对称性和重尾特性来预测风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的最先进成员推理攻击需要训练大量计算昂贵的参考模型，限制了实用性。需要开发无需参考模型就能评估模型隐私风险的方法。

Method: 利用损失分布的不对称性和重尾特性，发现高风险点从分布尾部（高损失区域）转移到头部（低损失区域），通过分析高损失区域异常值的缺失来预测模型脆弱性。

Result: 该方法在多种架构和数据集上都能准确估计模型对最先进MIA攻击（LiRA）的脆弱性，优于低成本攻击（如RMIA）和其他分布差异度量方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为评估模型隐私风险提供了一种高效实用的替代方案，特别在大型语言模型的风险评估中显示出良好前景。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

TL;DR: GaLLoP是一种基于梯度的稀疏学习技术，仅微调梯度幅度大且预训练幅度小的参数，在保持预训练知识的同时提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏微调技术的效果依赖于最优参数选择，需要找到既对任务相关又对预训练知识破坏最小的参数。

Method: 选择梯度幅度最大（任务相关性强）且预训练幅度最小（对预训练知识破坏小）的参数进行微调。

Result: 在LLaMA3 8B和Gemma 2B上的实验表明，GaLLoP在分布内和分布外性能上优于或匹配LoRA、DoRA、SAFT等技术，缓解灾难性遗忘和任务数据记忆问题。

Conclusion: GaLLoP通过选择性微调关键参数，实现了稳定的性能提升和更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动方法依赖I.I.D.数据假设，但现有泛化技术需要环境标签，而这些标签在训练时往往由于数据采集挑战、隐私问题和环境变异性而不可得。

Method: 通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来推断环境规范，实现直接从数据中进行环境分配，解决了无标签场景下的交替优化问题。

Result: 实验表明DynaInfer优于现有环境分配技术，能快速收敛到真实标签，甚至在环境标签可用时也能实现更优性能。

Conclusion: DynaInfer为处理无环境标签情况下的动态系统分析提供了有效解决方案，在多种动态系统中都表现出色。

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种检测模型抄袭的方法，通过分析训练数据顺序相关性来证明Bob是否使用了Alice的模型，在查询设置和观察设置下都能有效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何证明Bob使用了Alice的开源模型的问题，特别是在Bob声称其模型为独立开发的情况下，需要提供统计证据来证明模型依赖性。

Method: 将问题建模为独立性测试，利用语言模型对后期训练数据记忆更强的特性，通过分析Bob模型输出与Alice训练数据顺序的相关性来检测模型依赖关系。在查询设置中直接估计Bob模型对Alice训练数据的似然度；在观察设置中使用两种方法：文本与训练数据重叠度分析，以及基于重新训练模型版本的似然度比较。

Result: 在查询设置中，对40多个Pythia和OLMo微调模型的分析显示，除6个案例外，其余都达到了p值≤1e-8的显著相关性。在观察设置中，第二种方法仅需几百个token就能可靠区分Bob的文本，第一种方法需要数十万个token才能达到高检测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测模型抄袭行为，为开源模型的知识产权保护提供了统计上可量化的证据，且不依赖于训练数据的具体内容。

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer是否能够作为元学习器，仅使用少量上下文示例适应新任务，而无需额外训练。

Method: 使用简化Transformer架构，在类别条件高斯混合模型的任务族上进行训练，其中均值向量位于共享的k维子空间中。

Result: 训练后，Transformer仅需O(k/R^4)个上下文示例就能泛化到新任务，这几乎匹配了知道共享子空间的最优学习器性能。

Conclusion: Transformer可以作为有效的元学习器，在任务间共享结构信息，显著优于仅依赖上下文数据的传统学习器。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练的计算需求加剧了高容量司法管辖区与全球南方国家之间的结构性不对称，需要研究在资源受限条件下建立AI主权的可行性。

Method: 采用双轴设计，变化加速器类型（NVIDIA H100 vs A100）和训练时长（90天 vs 150天），估算10万亿token模型的算力需求、能耗、资本支出和监管兼容性。

Result: 所有配置都低于出口管制和电力基础设施阈值，但财政可行性取决于硬件效率。H100方案总成本为800-1400万美元，A100方案需要1900-3200万美元。

Conclusion: 延长训练时间应被视为缓解硬件约束的政策杠杆，使中等收入国家能够在不参与全球前沿竞争的情况下，生产可用、可审计且本地对齐的模型，建立可持续的AI能力。

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

Motivation: 众包物流平台中供应商参与的不确定性给供需匹配带来挑战，需要开发能够处理供应商随机拒绝行为的优化方法。

Method: 提出两阶段推荐匹配模型，使用混合整数指数锥规划(MIECP)来近似求解随机优化问题，克服确定性线性近似方法的性能限制。

Result: 在合成数据和真实货运数据上的实验表明，MIECP方法实现了接近最优的匹配性能，同时相比基准方法减少了90%以上的计算时间。

Conclusion: MIECP方法能有效处理供应商不确定参与问题，在保持高质量匹配的同时大幅提升计算效率，为众包物流平台的供需匹配提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Matching demand with supply in crowd-sourcing logistics platforms must
contend with uncertain worker participation. Motivated by this challenge, we
study a two-stage ``recommend-to-match" problem under stochastic supplier
rejections, where each demand is initially recommended to multiple potential
suppliers prior to final matching decisions. We formulate a stochastic
optimization model that explicitly captures uncertain supplier acceptance
behavior. We show that an exact mixed-integer linear formulation is obtainable
for the special case with homogeneous and independent acceptance responses, but
the general problem does not admit an efficient formulation. Particularly, our
analysis reveals that deterministic linear approximation methods can perform
arbitrarily poorly in such settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
new approximation approach based on mixed-integer exponential cone programming
(MIECP) and establish its parametric performance guarantees. Extensive
experiments on synthetic data and real-world freight data validate the
effectiveness of our approach. Our MIECP-based solution achieves near-optimal
matching performance while reducing computation time by over 90% compared to
benchmark methods.

Motivation: 研究动态输出反馈控制的策略梯度方法收敛性，解决传统方法在非凸优化中缺乏理论保证的问题。

Method: 使用输入输出历史(IOH)表示将动态输出反馈控制等价转换为静态部分状态反馈，引入小过程噪声确保问题强凸性，应用策略梯度方法。

Result: 证明策略梯度方法在松弛问题中收敛到O(ε)-平稳点，数值实验显示收敛到全局最优LQG控制器附近。

Conclusion: IOH表示和松弛技术为动态输出反馈控制的策略梯度方法提供了理论收敛保证，展示了在实际问题中的有效性。

Abstract: We study the policy gradient method (PGM) for the linear quadratic Gaussian
(LQG) dynamic output-feedback control problem using an input-output-history
(IOH) representation of the closed-loop system. First, we show that any dynamic
output-feedback controller is equivalent to a static partial-state feedback
gain for a new system representation characterized by a finite-length IOH.
Leveraging this equivalence, we reformulate the search for an optimal dynamic
output feedback controller as an optimization problem over the corresponding
partial-state feedback gain. Next, we introduce a relaxed version of the
IOH-based LQG problem by incorporating a small process noise with covariance
$\epsilon I$ into the new system to ensure coerciveness, a key condition for
establishing gradient-based convergence guarantees. Consequently, we show that
a vanilla PGM for the relaxed problem converges to an
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$-stationary point, i.e., $\overline{K}$ satisfying
$\|\nabla J(\overline{K})\|_F \leq \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$, where $J$ denotes
the original LQG cost. Numerical experiments empirically indicate convergence
to the vicinity of the globally optimal LQG controller.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZO) has been a powerful framework for solving
black-box problems, which estimates gradients using zeroth-order data to update
variables iteratively. The practical applicability of ZO critically depends on
the efficiency of single-step gradient estimation and the overall query
complexity. However, existing ZO algorithms cannot achieve efficiency on both
simultaneously. In this work, we consider a general constrained optimization
model with black-box objective and constraint functions. To solve it, we
propose novel algorithms that can achieve the state-of-the-art overall query
complexity bound of $\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon^4)$ to find an
$\epsilon$-stationary solution ($d$ is the dimension of variable space), while
reducing the queries for estimating a single-step gradient from
$\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Specifically, we integrate block updates
with gradient descent ascent and a block gradient estimator, which leads to two
algorithms, ZOB-GDA and ZOB-SGDA, respectively. Instead of constructing full
gradients, they estimate only partial gradients along random blocks of
dimensions, where the adjustable block sizes enable high single-step efficiency
without sacrificing convergence guarantees. Our theoretical results establish
the finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithms for nonconvex
optimization. Finally, numerical experiments on a practical problem demonstrate
that our algorithms require over ten times fewer queries than existing methods.

Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite set of $n$ elements, $f: 2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ be
a nonnegative monotone supermodular function, and $k$ be a positive integer no
greater than $n$. This paper addresses the problem of maximizing $f(S)$ over
all subsets $S \subseteq V$ subject to the cardinality constraint $|S| = k$ or
$|S|\le k$.
  Let $r$ be a constant integer. The function $f$ is assumed to be {\em
$r$-decomposable}, meaning there exist $m\,(\ge1)$ subsets $V_1, \dots, V_m$ of
$V$, each with a cardinality at most $r$, and a corresponding set of
nonnegative supermodular functions $f_i : 2^{V_i} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$,
$i=1,\ldots,m$ such that $f(S) =\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(S \cap V_i)$ holds for each $S
\subseteq V$. Given $r$ as an input, we present a polynomial-time
$O(n^{(r-1)/2})$-approximation algorithm for this maximization problem, which
does not require prior knowledge of the specific decomposition.
  When the decomposition $(V_i,f_i)_{i=1}^m$ is known, an additional
connectivity requirement is introduced to the problem. Let $G$ be the graph
with vertex set $V$ and edge set $\cup_{i=1}^m \{uv:u,v\in V_i,u\neq v\}$. The
cardinality constrained solution set $S$ is required to induce a connected
subgraph in $G$. This model generalizes the well-known problem of finding the
densest connected $k$-subgraph. We propose a polynomial time
$O(n^{(r-1)/2})$-approximation algorithm for this generalization. Notably, this
algorithm gives an $O(n^{1/2})$-approximation for the densest connected
$k$-subgraph problem, improving upon the previous best-known approximation
ratio of $O(n^{2/3})$.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend the context of nonmonotone descent methods
to the class of nonsmooth and nonconvex functions called upper-$\mathcal{C}^2$,
which satisfy a nonsmooth and local version of the descent lemma. Under this
assumption, we propose a general subgradient method that performs a nonmonotone
linesearch, and we prove subsequential convergence to a stationary point of the
optimization problem. Our approach allows us to cover the setting of various
subgradient algorithms, including Newton and quasi-Newton methods. In addition,
we propose a specification of the general scheme, named Self-adaptive
Nonmonotone Subgradient Method (SNSM), which automatically updates the
parameters of the linesearch. Particular attention is paid to the minimum
sum-of-squares clustering problem, for which we provide a concrete
implementation of SNSM. We conclude with some numerical experiments where we
exhibit the advantages of SNSM in comparison with some known algorithms.

Abstract: A sensor has the ability to probe its surroundings. However, uncertainties in
its exact location can significantly compromise its sensing performance. The
radius of robust feasibility defines the maximum range within which robust
feasibility is ensured. This work introduces a novel approach integrating it
with the directional sensor networks to enhance coverage using a distributed
greedy algorithm. In particular, we provide an exact formula for the radius of
robust feasibility of sensors in a directional sensor network. The proposed
model strategically orients the sensors in regions with high coverage
potential, accounting for robustness in the face of uncertainty. We analyze the
algorithm's adaptability in dynamic environments, demonstrating its ability to
enhance efficiency and robustness. Experimental results validate its efficacy
in maximizing coverage and optimizing sensor orientations, highlighting its
practical advantages for real-world scenarios.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于求解单比率分数最小化问题的近端次梯度-凸差函数算法(PS-DCA)，该问题在球面上的非光滑优化中常见。算法结合了凸差优化，对初始点不敏感且能避免陷入低质量局部极小值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多科学领域中的球面非光滑优化问题可以转化为等价的分数规划问题，需要开发有效的算法来求解这类问题。

Method: 提出了PS-DCA算法，结合了近端次梯度和凸差函数优化。当移除DCA步骤时，算法简化为近端次梯度算法(PSA)。

Result: 证明了PS-DCA和PSA产生的序列的任何聚点都是问题的临界点。对于广义图傅里叶模式问题，建立了整个序列的全局收敛性。数值实验表明PS-DCA比近端梯度类算法更优。

Conclusion: PS-DCA算法通过整合凸差优化，对初始点不敏感且能避免陷入低质量局部极小值，在求解分数最小化问题上表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of single-ratio fractional minimization
problems, where both the numerator and denominator of the objective are convex
functions satisfying positive homogeneity. Many nonsmooth optimization problems
on the sphere that are commonly encountered in application scenarios across
different scientific fields can be converted into this equivalent fractional
programming. We derive local and global optimality conditions of the problem
and subsequently propose a proximal-subgradient-difference of convex functions
algorithm (PS-DCA) to compute its critical points. When the DCA step is
removed, PS-DCA reduces to the proximal-subgradient algorithm (PSA). Under mild
assumptions regarding the algorithm parameters, it is shown that any
accumulation point of the sequence produced by PS-DCA or PSA is a critical
point of the problem. Moreover, for a typical class of generalized graph
Fourier mode problems, we establish global convergence of the entire sequence
generated by PS-DCA or PSA. Numerical experiments conducted on computing the
generalized graph Fourier modes demonstrate that, compared to proximal
gradient-type algorithms, PS-DCA integrates difference of convex functions
(d.c.) optimization, rendering it less sensitive to initial points and
preventing the sequence it generates from being trapped in low-quality local
minimizers.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文分析了无终端条件的随机经济模型预测控制，基于随机耗散性和转向点特性构建闭环Lyapunov函数，确保在随机收敛意义下的稳定性，并推导了接近最优的性能界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定性MPC已有成熟理论，但随机MPC的严格稳定性和性能保证仍局限于终端约束和惩罚条件，需要建立无终端条件的随机经济MPC理论框架。

Method: 利用随机耗散性和转向点特性构建闭环Lyapunov函数，分析不同随机收敛概念下的稳定性，并比较基于分布知识和采样状态信息的两种实现方法。

Result: 证明了特定最优平稳过程的P-实际渐近稳定性，推导了平均和非平均性能的紧近优界，验证了理论结果在实际可实施算法中的适用性。

Conclusion: 将经典确定性MPC结果扩展到随机领域，建立了无终端条件的随机经济MPC理论框架，并通过数值示例验证了理论发现。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is well understood in the deterministic
setting, yet rigorous stability and performance guarantees for stochastic MPC
remain limited to the consideration of terminal constraints and penalties. In
contrast, this work analyzes stochastic economic MPC with an expected cost
criterion and establishes closed-loop guarantees without terminal conditions.
Relying on stochastic dissipativity and turnpike properties, we construct
closed-loop Lyapunov functions that ensure $P$-practical asymptotic stability
of a particular optimal stationary process under different notions of
stochastic convergence, such as in distribution or in the $p$-th mean. In
addition, we derive tight near-optimal bounds for both averaged and
non-averaged performance, thereby extending classical deterministic results to
the stochastic domain. Finally, we show that the abstract stochastic MPC scheme
requiring distributional knowledge shares the same closed-loop properties as a
practically implementable algorithm based only on sampled state information,
ensuring applicability of our findings. Our findings are illustrated by a
numerical example.

Method: 采用分层分析方法：首先分析算法的确定性公式，然后将结果扩展到由随机微分方程系统控制的全随机设置。

Result: 分析表明，包括几乎必然收敛和均方指数收敛在内的基本稳定性特性在两种机制中都持续存在，并提供了收敛速率的精确定量估计。

Conclusion: 该研究为CBO算法在有限种群规模下的稳定性提供了理论保证，证明了其收敛性能在有限代理设置中仍然有效。

Abstract: We study the finite-agent behavior of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO), a
recent metaheuristic for the global minimization of a function, that combines
drift toward a consensus estimate with stochastic exploration. While previous
analyses focus on asymptotic mean-field limits, we investigate the stability
properties of CBO for finite population size \( N \). Following a hierarchical
approach, we first analyze a deterministic formulation of the algorithm and
then extend our results to the fully stochastic setting governed by a system of
stochastic differential equations. Our analysis reveals that essential
stability properties, including almost sure and mean square exponential
convergence, persist in both regimes and provides sharp quantitative estimates
on the rates of convergence.

Abstract: This work develops a rigorous numerical framework for solving time-dependent
Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) governed by partial differential equations,
with a particular focus on biomedical applications. The approach deals with
adjoint-based Lagrangian methodology, which enables efficient gradient

therapy and (ii) a catheter-based drug delivery system in a patient-specific
coronary artery. Numerical experiments not only demonstrate the accuracy of the
approach, but also its flexibility and robustness in handling complex
geometries, heterogeneous parameters, and realistic boundary conditions,

Conclusion: 提出的算法为UBSR优化提供了高效的计算解决方案，特别适用于高维投资组合优化问题。

Abstract: Utility-based shortfall risk (UBSR), a convex risk measure sensitive to tail
losses, has gained popularity in recent years. However, research on
computational methods for UBSR optimization remains relatively scarce. In this
paper, we propose a fast and scalable algorithm for the UBSR-based portfolio
optimization problem. Leveraging the Sample Average Approximation (SAA)
framework, we reformulate the problem as a block-separable convex program and
solve it efficiently via the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM). In the high-dimensional setting, a key challenge arises in one of the
subproblems -- a projection onto a nonlinear feasibility set defined by the
shortfall-risk constraint. We propose two semismooth Newton algorithms to solve
this projection subproblem. The first algorithm directly applies a semismooth
Newton iteration to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system of the projection
problem. The second algorithm employs an implicit function transformation of
semismooth functions to reduce the problem to a univariate equation involving
the Lagrange multiplier and achieves global superlinear convergence with
enhanced numerical stability under mild regularity conditions. Theoretical
convergence guarantees of the proposed algorithms are established, and
numerical experiments demonstrate a substantial speedup over state-of-the-art
solvers, particularly in high-dimensional regimes.

Motivation: 现有稀疏识别方法在重现时间序列方面效果一般，但通常无法产生一致的、可解释的隔室模型，也无法保持总人口守恒，这是原则性隔室建模的常见特性。

Method: 提出线性规划公式，使用纯一范数目标，从设计矩阵的零空间采样，并对隔室间流动施加线性约束。

Result: 在合成数据上的数值实验表明，该方法能确保模型稀疏性，准确捕捉系统动态，并保持人口守恒。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了传统稀疏回归方法在流行病学隔室模型识别中的局限性，提供了更可靠和可解释的模型识别框架。

Abstract: We investigate the application of a framework for sparse model identification
of differential equations from timeseries data in the context of compartmental
models in epidemiology. Such frameworks often seek a sparse representation from
a polynomial basis in the state variables which reproduces the timeseries.
Out-of-the-box approaches for the underlying sparse regression problem have
moderate success reproducing the provided timeseries, but typically fail at
producing a consistent, interpretable compartment model and conserving the
total population, which are common properties in principled compartment
modeling. Additionally, the conserved polynomial quantities, such as the sum of
state variables, add algebraic nuances to a polynomial design matrix. We
propose a linear program formulation to solve these issues by posing a pure
one-norm objective, sampling from the nullspace of the design matrix, and
imposing a set of linear constraints for between-compartment flows. We conduct
several numerical experiments on synthetic data and succeed in ensuring model
sparsity, accurately capturing system dynamics, and preserving conservation of
population.

Motivation: 传统电力系统规划通常将负荷视为固定输入，但大型负荷（如数据中心和直接空气捕获设施）的选址和运行灵活性对系统成本和可靠性有重要影响，需要主动规划方法。

Method: 采用两阶段随机混合整数优化模型，包含跨场景期望约束，使用增强型渐进对冲算法在HPC平台上实现场景并行化，利用mpisppy的边界特性处理可扩展性挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的主动规划框架能够有效考虑大型负荷的选址和运行灵活性，为电力系统容量扩展提供更全面的优化方案。

Abstract: We propose explicitly incorporating large-scale load siting into a stochastic
nodal power system capacity expansion planning model that concurrently
co-optimizes generation, transmission and storage expansion. The potential
operational flexibility of some of these large loads is also taken into account
by considering them as consisting of a set of tranches with different
reliability requirements, which are modeled as a constraint on expected served
energy across operational scenarios. We implement our model as a two-stage
stochastic mixed-integer optimization problem with cross-scenario expectation
constraints. To overcome the challenge of scalability, we build upon existing
work to implement this model on a high performance computing platform and
exploit scenario parallelization using an augmented Progressive Hedging
Algorithm. The algorithm is implemented using the bounding features of mpisppy,
which have shown to provide satisfactory provable optimality gaps despite the
absence of theoretical guarantees of convergence. We test our approach to
assess the value of this proactive planning framework on total system cost and
reliability metrics using realistic testcases geographically assigned to San
Diego and South Carolina, with datacenter and direct air capture facilities as
large loads.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架来分析测试时缩放中验证器的作用，将可验证测试时缩放建模为传输问题，揭示了次优性-覆盖率曲线的三个机制，并分析了顺序和批量采样算法的计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然带有验证的测试时缩放显示出提升大语言模型性能的潜力，但验证器的作用及其不完善性仍未得到充分探索。现有研究只捕捉了这些因素的部分子集，缺乏量化它们相互作用的统一框架。

Method: 将可验证测试时缩放构建为传输问题，通过分析生成器的覆盖率、验证器的收敛区域和采样算法的次优性之间的相互作用，提出了顺序和批量两类采样算法。

Result: 理论分析表明次优性-覆盖率曲线存在三个机制：传输机制（次优性随覆盖率增加）、策略改进机制（次优性可能随覆盖率减少，取决于验证器的收敛区域）和饱和机制（次优性趋于稳定）。实证结果与Qwen、Llama和Gemma模型验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解测试时缩放中验证器的作用提供了统一的理论框架，揭示了覆盖率、验证器性能和采样算法之间的复杂相互作用，对优化大语言模型的测试时缩放策略具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习诊断方法依赖静态数据集，无法反映临床实践中顺序性、资源感知的推理过程。诊断在高压或资源有限环境中复杂且易出错，需要能帮助临床医生及时、经济决策的框架。

Method: 结合贝叶斯实验设计(BED)与大语言模型(LLM)，LLM作为灵活模拟器生成患者状态分布并支持信念更新，无需结构化任务特定训练数据。临床医生可参与审查测试建议、解释中间输出。

Result: 在真实数据集上评估显示，ACTMED能优化测试选择，提高诊断准确性、可解释性和资源使用效率。

Conclusion: 该框架向透明、自适应且与临床医生对齐的诊断系统迈进一步，能在减少领域特定数据依赖的情况下跨环境泛化。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类偏好的奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击和泛化能力差的问题，它们通过利用训练数据中的虚假特征（如回答冗长、讨好语气等）来获得高奖励分数，而非真正反映预期目标。

Method: 受核视角不变性理论启发，提出PRISM方法，通过闭式学习目标学习具有特征映射的群体不变核函数。

Conclusion: PRISM为基于偏好的对齐建立了一个鲁棒的框架，有效缓解了奖励模型中的捷径行为问题。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural

probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a

Method: 采用行为和元认知分析方法，使用专家验证的数据，在三种提示条件下系统比较了两个代表性的大型语言模型。

Result: 模型在处理不同CONSORT项目和提示类型时表现出明显差异，包括推理风格的转变、明确的不确定性表达和替代解释方式。

Conclusion: 结果突显了这些系统在临床合规自动化方面的当前局限性，并强调了理解其认知适应和策略行为对于开发更可解释和可靠的医疗AI的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

### [112] [The Zero-Step Thinking: An Empirical Study of Mode Selection as Harder Early Exit in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19176)
*Yuqiao Tan,Shizhu He,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了推理模型中的模式选择问题，将其识别为早期退出问题的更具挑战性变体，旨在通过零步思考减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但逐步思考过程常导致过度思考和不必要的计算开销。模式选择和早期退出方法都旨在减轻这种计算负担。

Method: 将模式选择定义为早期退出问题的变体，比较了基于提示的方法和利用模型内部信息的方法在九个基准上的表现。

Result: 基于提示的方法由于分类能力有限而经常失败，而利用内部信息的方法在大多数场景中表现更好但仍存在稳定性问题。

Conclusion: 现有仅依赖模型提供信息的方法在信息有限的情况下不足以有效解决模式选择问题，突显了该任务的持续挑战。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/Zero_Step_Thinking.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebGraphEval是一个将多智能体轨迹抽象为统一加权动作图的框架，用于评估网络智能体，能够捕捉结构多样性并识别关键决策点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络智能体评估主要依赖二元成功指标或单一参考轨迹，忽略了基准数据集中的结构多样性。

Method: 将多个智能体的轨迹抽象为统一加权动作图，进行规范编码、合并重复行为，并应用结构分析（奖励传播和成功加权边统计）。

Result: 在六个网络智能体的数千条轨迹评估中，图抽象捕捉了跨模型规律性，突出了冗余和低效，识别了基于结果指标忽略的关键决策点。

Conclusion: 通过将网络交互构建为图结构数据，WebGraphEval为网络智能体建立了多路径、跨智能体和效率感知评估的通用方法。

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

*Marianna Molinari,Ilaria Angela Amantea,Marinella Quaranta,Guido Governatori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过法律领域实验评估ChatGPT性能，发现即使具备相关知识能力，ChatGPT仍无法整合推理得出全面结果，揭示了其在复杂问题分解和综合解决方面的重大局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估ChatGPT在法律领域的实际表现，特别是与正则表达式基线对比，而非仅与人类表现比较，以揭示AI在复杂推理任务中的真实局限性。

Method: 在法律领域进行实验，将ChatGPT与正则表达式(Regex)基线方法进行性能对比，重点分析AI在提取法律决策关键段落和整合法律原则方面的能力。

Result: ChatGPT即使拥有必要知识和能力，也无法有效整合和推理以产生全面结果，在法律原则提取和综合理解方面表现不足。

Conclusion: 真正的智能需要分解复杂问题并基于多种能力提供统一全面解决方案的能力，这在法律领域仍是人类独有的特质，AI目前存在根本性局限。

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了推导状态论证框架(DSA-framework)，为容纳不一致先例的广义理由模型提供论证性解释方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统先例推理假设先例集合必须一致，而广义理由模型放松了这一假设。目前存在基于传统一致理由模型的论证解释方法，但缺乏针对容纳不一致先例的广义推理框架的相应论证解释方法。

Method: 扩展推导状态论证框架(DSA-framework)，以解释基于广义理由模型的推理过程。

Result: 开发了能够处理不一致先例的论证性解释框架。

Conclusion: 成功扩展了DSA框架，为广义理由模型提供了论证性解释能力，填补了不一致先例推理中解释方法的空白。

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体LLM模拟框架，通过行为奖励函数和情境学习来研究LLM智能体是否能再现人类在线社交动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型智能体是否能复制人类在线行为的复杂社交动态，包括同质性、互惠性和社会验证等特征，以及哪些记忆和学习机制能促成这种动态的出现。

Method: 设计了一个多智能体LLM模拟框架，智能体通过重复互动、相互评估和情境学习来适应行为，使用捕捉在线参与核心驱动因素的行为奖励函数，包括社交互动、信息寻求、自我呈现、协调和情感支持。

Result: 实验表明，经过指导的LLM智能体发展出稳定的互动模式并形成涌现的社交联系，产生的网络结构反映了真实在线社区的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LLM群体中的集体动态建立了原则性测试平台，揭示了人工智能体如何近似或偏离类人社交行为。

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了CKA-RL方法，通过持续知识适应策略和自适应知识合并机制，解决强化学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升跨任务知识利用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境通常是非平稳的，需要智能体持续适应新任务和变化条件。现有的持续强化学习方法存在灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题。

Method: 提出持续知识适应策略，维护任务特定知识向量池，动态使用历史知识适应新任务；引入自适应知识合并机制，合并相似知识向量以减少内存需求。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，CKA-RL优于最先进方法，整体性能提升4.20%，前向迁移提升8.02%。

Conclusion: CKA-RL通过有效的知识积累和适应机制，成功解决了持续强化学习中的关键挑战，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

*Jia-Kai Dong,I-Wei Huang,Chun-Tin Wu,Yi-Tien Tsai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSC-Bench是一个用于评估LLM代理在分层MCP生态系统中多跳端到端工具编排能力的大规模基准测试，通过构建"等函数集"作为真实标准，减少对LLM作为评判的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往孤立评估工具，忽略了功能重叠和跨服务器编排等挑战，导致评估过于乐观。

Method: 构建五级课程体系，从单工具编排到复杂跨服务器规划，系统测试代理能力，并通过等函数集构建真实标准。

Result: 实验表明，僵化的层次结构会阻碍性能，即使最先进的代理在鲁棒性方面也表现出系统性弱点。

Conclusion: MSC-Bench提供了一个诊断框架来暴露这些限制，并指导开发更强大、更高效的工具使用代理。

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at
https://github.com/snooow1029/MSC_Bench.

*Wonje Choi,Jooyoung Kim,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeSyPr是一个新颖的具身推理框架，通过神经符号程序化将知识编译为结构化表示，使语言模型代理能够在动态环境中进行高效推理，无需依赖外部符号规划器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态环境中采用语言模型进行具身任务时面临的延迟、连接性和资源限制问题，特别是在需要在线访问大规模推理引擎或符号规划器的情况下。

Method: 首先使用符号工具生成任务特定计划，然后将这些计划转化为可组合的程序表示，编码计划的隐式产生规则，使组合后的程序能够无缝集成到语言模型的推理过程中。

Result: 在PDDLGym、VirtualHome和ALFWorld等具身基准测试中，NeSyPr展示了比大规模推理模型和符号规划器更高效的推理能力，同时使用更紧凑的语言模型。

Conclusion: 神经符号程序化将多步符号结构化路径查找和推理抽象为单步语言模型推理，支持在延迟敏感和资源受限的物理系统中进行高效测试时推理。

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

TL;DR: 提出了DAIL方法，通过分布策略和语义对齐来解决语言指令的模糊性问题，在结构和视觉观察基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指令的灵活性导致语言条件任务中存在严重模糊性，这会显著降低算法性能。

Method: DAIL方法包含两个关键组件：分布策略和语义对齐。分布策略通过值分布估计机制增强任务可区分性，语义对齐模块捕捉轨迹与语言指令之间的对应关系。

Result: 在结构和视觉观察基准测试上的广泛实验结果表明，DAIL能有效解决指令模糊性问题，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DAIL方法通过分布对齐学习有效解决了语言指令的模糊性问题，在多个基准测试中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp是首个评估深度搜索代理在分层规则应用能力的电商基准测试，要求代理根据商品描述预测10位HS编码，结果显示最佳代理准确率仅46.8%，远低于人类专家的95.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试忽视了深度搜索代理应用复杂规则（如法律条款、关税规则）的关键能力，这些规则具有模糊边界和隐式逻辑关系，需要填补这一评估空白。

Method: 从大型电商平台收集真实数据构建HSCodeComp基准，包含632个产品条目，涵盖多样化产品类别，HS编码由多位人类专家标注。

Result: 在多个最先进LLM和代理上的实验显示巨大性能差距：最佳代理仅达到46.8%的10位准确率，远低于人类专家的95.0%，测试时扩展也无法进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 分层规则应用对深度搜索代理具有挑战性，现有代理在处理复杂规则方面能力有限，需要开发更强大的规则理解和应用能力。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Motivation: 现有的城市感知系统在多样化城市场景中泛化能力有限，决策过程缺乏可解释性。需要开发能够适应动态城市条件、考虑工作者偏好并提供透明解释的系统。

Method: 采用混合训练免费框架，结合经典规划器生成基线解决方案，然后通过多智能体进化系统迭代优化，将大语言模型集成到参与式城市感知中。

Result: 在两个大规模移动数据集和七种动态干扰类型上的实验表明，AgentSense在适应性和可解释性方面优于传统方法，相比单智能体LLM基线在性能和鲁棒性方面表现更优，并提供更合理透明的解释。

Conclusion: AgentSense代表了向部署自适应和可解释城市感知系统的重要进展，为基于网络的参与式城市感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

Motivation: 和弦音即兴演奏是爵士吉他理论的基础练习，但学习和实践难度较大，需要工具辅助学生掌握这一重要技能。

Method: 首先生成和弦音琶音，构建加权图（节点代表和弦琶音，边权重基于最优过渡音计算），然后寻找最短路径并重构和弦音即兴演奏线条。

Result: 开发了一个用户友好的系统，能够处理输入输出，为吉他学生提供可练习的和弦音即兴演奏建议。

Conclusion: 该图论引擎为吉他学生提供了有效的和弦音即兴演奏练习工具，有助于掌握这一重要的爵士吉他基础技能。

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE框架将大语言模型与概率建模结合，学习带权重的规则集，通过规则生成、逻辑回归学习权重、迭代优化和评估四个阶段，发现直接使用学习到的权重规则比将规则注入LLM效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的规则学习方法忽略规则间的相互作用，且未充分利用LLM与概率规则学习的结合潜力，需要开发更稳健的推理框架。

Method: 四阶段框架：1) LLM生成和筛选规则候选；2) 逻辑回归学习概率权重进行全局选择和校准；3) 基于预测误差迭代优化规则集；4) 评估加权规则集作为直接分类器的性能。

Result: 直接使用学习到的权重规则表现更优，而将规则、权重和逻辑模型输出提示给LLM反而会降低准确性，表明LLM擅长语义生成和解释，但在精确概率整合方面可靠性较低。

Conclusion: RLIE阐明了LLM在归纳推理中的潜力和局限性，通过将LLM与经典概率规则组合方法结合，实现了更可靠的神经符号推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的具身智能策略在处理长期任务时，视觉输入经常超出transformer的上下文限制，而人类能够将一生经验压缩为记忆进行利用。现有方法主要关注固定大小记忆的循环模型或完全依赖上下文的transformer，缺乏有效的记忆压缩机制。

Method: Memo采用transformer架构，在训练过程中通过在模型输入中插入周期性总结标记来实现记忆的创建和检索。这种方法允许模型学习如何压缩和利用历史信息。

Result: 在网格世界元强化学习基准和照片级真实室内环境的多目标导航任务中，Memo优于简单的长上下文transformer基线，同时具有更高的计算和存储效率。Memo在推理时对更长上下文具有更好的泛化能力，并在需要截断历史上下文的流式设置中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Memo通过引入记忆创建和检索机制，有效解决了transformer在长视野任务中的上下文限制问题，为具身智能在长期环境中的操作提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

TL;DR: PROBE是一个评估LLM智能体主动性的新基准，将主动性分解为三个核心能力：搜索未指定问题、识别具体瓶颈和执行适当解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主动性的基准局限于局部上下文，无法测试跨来源和长时间跨度的推理能力，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: PROBE将主动性分解为三个核心能力管道，并应用于评估领先的LLM和流行的智能体框架。

Result: 即使最先进的模型也难以解决该基准，GPT-5和Claude Opus-4.1的最佳端到端性能仅为40%，揭示了智能体系统自主行动的当前局限性。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了智能体系统自主行动的当前局限性，并揭示了有前景的未来研究方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

TL;DR: 提出了WorldTest评估协议，用于评估模型学习智能体，将无奖励交互与不同环境中的测试阶段分离，支持多种未知任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型学习和评估方法偏离了实际目标，训练和评估都局限于下一帧预测，成功标准是在同一环境中最大化奖励。

Method: 开发了WorldTest协议，包含无奖励探索、派生测试和行为评分三个模板，并实例化为AutumnBench测试套件，包含43个网格世界环境和129个任务。

Result: 人类参与者表现优于前沿模型，计算规模扩展只在某些环境中提升性能，在其他环境中无效。

Conclusion: WorldTest为评估智能体对环境动态的学习提供了新模板，AutumnBench揭示了世界模型学习的显著改进空间。

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.
