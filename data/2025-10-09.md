TL;DR: AlphaApollo是一个自演化的智能推理系统，通过整合多个模型和专业工具来解决基础模型推理能力有限和测试时迭代不可靠的问题，在AIME 2024/2025评估中显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础模型推理能力的两个瓶颈：模型内在能力有限和测试时迭代不可靠，通过工具整合提升推理质量。

Method: 使用计算工具（Python数值和符号库）和检索工具（任务相关外部信息）进行精确计算和决策基础，通过共享状态图支持多轮多模型解决方案演化。

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025评估中，Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct平均提升5.15%，通过率提升23.34%；Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct平均提升8.91%，通过率提升26.67%。超过80%的工具调用成功执行。

Conclusion: AlphaApollo通过工具整合和迭代优化，有效提升了基础模型的推理能力上限，实现了自演化的智能推理。

Abstract: We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to
address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited
model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo
orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate,
verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical
and symbolic libraries) and (ii) a retrieval tool (task-relevant external
information) to execute exact calculations and ground decisions. The system
further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state
map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative
refinement. In evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 across multiple models,
AlphaApollo delivers consistent gains: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32
for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and +8.91% Average@32 with +26.67% Pass@32 for
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Tool-use analysis shows that more than 80% of tool
calls are successfully executed, with consistent outperformance of non-tool
baselines, thereby lifting the capability ceiling of FMs. More empirical
results and implementation details will be updated at

### [2] [Bridging Reasoning to Learning: Unmasking Illusions using Complexity Out of Distribution Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06274)
*Mohammad Mahdi Samiei Paqaleh,Arash Marioriyad,Arman Tahmasebi-Zadeh,Mohamadreza Fereydooni,Mahdi Ghaznavai,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了复杂性分布外泛化框架，通过测试实例的最小解复杂度超过训练样本来定义和衡量推理能力，统一了学习和推理的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在推理能力方面缺乏清晰的定义和度量标准，需要建立系统性框架来形式化评估推理能力。

Method: 基于解描述的Kolmogorov复杂性和操作性代理指标，区分复杂性OoD与长度和组合OoD，提出在基准设计、监督方式、归纳偏差等方面的实践建议。

Result: 建立了复杂性OoD泛化框架，明确了推理能力的度量标准，并提供了实现复杂性OoD泛化的具体方法路径。

Conclusion: 复杂性OoD不能仅通过扩展数据解决，需要专门针对复杂性的架构和训练机制来发展稳健的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward
problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with
large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of
distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,
consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity
Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem
setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD
generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal
required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution
structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that
of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description
Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;
reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and
compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases
solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like
under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over
solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with
recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:
incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,
rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing
inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to
reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic
forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved
by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require
architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate
computation with respect to complexity.

### [3] [BuilderBench -- A benchmark for generalist agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06288)
*Raj Ghugare,Catherine Ji,Kathryn Wantlin,Jin Schofield,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了BuilderBench基准测试，用于评估智能体通过开放式探索学习构建结构的能力，包含物理模拟器和42个目标结构任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型主要通过模仿学习，难以解决超出已有数据范围的新问题，需要开发能够通过交互经验学习的智能体。

Method: 开发了包含硬件加速模拟器和多样化任务套件的基准测试，智能体在无监督下探索学习环境原理，然后构建未见过的目标结构。

Result: 实验表明当前算法在这些任务上表现不佳，因此提供了简化训练协议和六种算法的参考实现。

Conclusion: BuilderBench为研究开放式探索的智能体预训练提供了重要基准，需要体现推理能力而非单纯的语言理解。

Abstract: Today's AI models learn primarily through mimicry and sharpening, so it is
not surprising that they struggle to solve problems beyond the limits set by
existing data. To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for
exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning
mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major
open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to
accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended
exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure
using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated
simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and
$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully
curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon
planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles
about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation,
agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving
these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected
in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and
piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge
the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training
wheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single
target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file
implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for
researchers.

### [4] [Requirements for Game-Based Learning Design Framework for Information System Integration in the Context of Post-Merger Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06302)
*Ksenija Lace,Marite Kirikova*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨如何通过游戏化学习设计解决信息系统集成培训中学习曲线陡峭和学习动机低的问题，提出针对并购后信息系统集成的游戏化学习框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并购后信息系统集成面临独特挑战，现有AMILI和AMILP方法在实际应用中存在学习曲线陡峭和学习动机低的问题，需要更有效的培训方法。

Method: 分析基础学习理论、认知负荷和动机模型以及严肃游戏设计框架，识别游戏化学习设计的关键要求，构建包含转换过程和最终学习体验两部分的框架。

Result: 提出了针对并购后信息系统集成的游戏化学习设计框架，通过迭代设计和实际验证来开发和评估该框架。

Conclusion: 游戏化学习设计能够将静态方法培训转化为引人入胜的学习体验，有效解决信息系统集成培训中的学习动机和认知负荷问题。

Abstract: Post-merger integration states unique challenges for professionals
responsible for information system integration aimed on alignment and
combination diverse system architectures of merging organizations. Although the
theoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the
business level, there is a significant gap in training for information system
integration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support
method for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for
informed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system
integration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical
application was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This
paper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by
transforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The
study analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation
models, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential
requirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information
system integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in
two components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience.
The paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed
framework through iterative design and real-world validation.

### [5] [Belief-Calibrated Multi-Agent Consensus Seeking for Complex NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06307)
*Wentao Deng,Jiahuan Pei,Zhiwei Xu,Zhaochun Ren,Zhumin Chen,Pengjie Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了BCCS框架，通过选择最优合作者和校准共识判断来解决多智能体系统中共识不稳定问题，在MATH和MMLU基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统的共识寻求方法依赖投票机制，忽视了系统内部信念的矛盾，且采用无差别协作方式，无法为每个智能体找到最优合作者，导致共识不稳定。

Method: 提出了理论框架来选择最大化共识稳定性的最优合作者，并基于此开发了BCCS框架，通过选择最优合作者和校准系统内部信念的共识判断来促进稳定共识。

Result: 在MATH和MMLU基准数据集上的实验结果显示，BCCS框架在挑战性任务上的准确率分别比现有最佳结果高出2.23%和3.95%。

Conclusion: BCCS框架通过优化合作者选择和共识判断校准，有效解决了多智能体系统中共识不稳定的问题，显著提升了复杂NLP任务的性能。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) enhances its capacity to solve complex natural
language processing (NLP) tasks through collaboration among multiple agents,
where consensus-seeking serves as a fundamental mechanism. However, existing
consensus-seeking approaches typically rely on voting mechanisms to judge
consensus, overlooking contradictions in system-internal beliefs that
destabilize the consensus. Moreover, these methods often involve agents
updating their results through indiscriminate collaboration with every other
agent. Such uniform interaction fails to identify the optimal collaborators for
each agent, hindering the emergence of a stable consensus. To address these
challenges, we provide a theoretical framework for selecting optimal
collaborators that maximize consensus stability. Based on the theorems, we
propose the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to facilitate
stable consensus via selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the
consensus judgment by system-internal beliefs. Experimental results on the MATH
and MMLU benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCCS framework
outperforms the best existing results by 2.23% and 3.95% of accuracy on
challenging tasks, respectively. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/dengwentao99/BCCS.

### [6] [Off-Trajectory Reasoning: Can LLMs Collaborate on Reasoning Trajectory?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06410)
*Aochong Oliver Li,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了推理LLMs在共享轨迹中协作的能力，发现更强的模型在干扰下更脆弱，所有模型都难以有效利用合作者的正确推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理LLMs是否能在共享推理轨迹中有效协作，评估标准训练流程是否能产生所需的离轨迹推理行为。

Method: 提出双测试：可恢复性（从误导推理中回溯）和可引导性（基于更强合作者的正确推理构建），评估15个开源LLMs（1.5B-32B），并进行控制研究分析训练因素影响。

Result: 更强的LLMs在干扰下更脆弱；所有模型在超出自身能力的问题上利用指导步骤的解决率低于9.2%；教师模型的不佳可恢复性行为会传递给蒸馏学生。

Conclusion: 现有推理LLMs在协作推理方面存在局限，需要专门训练来培养强大的推理合作者，为多模型协作评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding
strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising
direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking
within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and
exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the
usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this
off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can
standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory
behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the
off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can
backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and
Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from
stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and
reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often
more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively
leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent
capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control
studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these
behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data
selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training
natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal
recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled
students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together,
this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in
shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf
reasoning LLMs.

### [7] [Flavonoid Fusion: Creating a Knowledge Graph to Unveil the Interplay Between Food and Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06433)
*Aryan Singh Dalal,Yinglun Zhang,Duru Doğan,Atalay Mert İleri,Hande Küçük McGinty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究创建了一个知识图谱，将食物与健康联系起来，重点关注类黄酮含量与癌症的关系，使用KNARM方法构建机器可操作的语义网络表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前很少有研究使用标准化的机器可读格式来表示食物与健康之间的关系，这限制了有效利用这些知识的能力。

Method: 使用KNARM方法构建知识图谱，整合USDA数据库中的类黄酮含量数据和文献中的癌症关联信息。

Result: 成功创建了一个连接食物与健康的知识图谱，为研究人员探索饮食选择与疾病管理之间的复杂关系提供了示例。

Conclusion: 该知识图谱为研究食物与健康关系提供了有效工具，未来需要扩展图谱范围、添加更多相关数据并进行推理以发现隐藏关系。

Abstract: The focus on "food as medicine" is gaining traction in the field of health
and several studies conducted in the past few years discussed this aspect of
food in the literature. However, very little research has been done on
representing the relationship between food and health in a standardized,
machine-readable format using a semantic web that can help us leverage this
knowledge effectively. To address this gap, this study aims to create a
knowledge graph to link food and health through the knowledge graph's ability
to combine information from various platforms focusing on flavonoid contents of
food found in the USDA databases and cancer connections found in the
literature. We looked closely at these relationships using KNARM methodology
and represented them in machine-operable format. The proposed knowledge graph
serves as an example for researchers, enabling them to explore the complex
interplay between dietary choices and disease management. Future work for this
study involves expanding the scope of the knowledge graph by capturing nuances,
adding more related data, and performing inferences on the acquired knowledge
to uncover hidden relationships.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PuzzlePlex基准测试，用于评估基础模型在复杂动态环境中的推理和规划能力，包含15种不同类型的谜题游戏，并开发了细粒度评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基础模型在复杂动态环境中的推理和规划能力及其可扩展性，需要设计一个全面的基准测试来评估这些能力。

Method: 设计PuzzlePlex基准测试框架，包含15种不同类型的谜题游戏（确定性和随机性、单人和双人场景），实现定制化游戏策略进行比较，开发细粒度评估指标，在指令基和代码基两种设置下分析前沿基础模型。

Result: 推理模型在指令基设置中表现最佳，代码基执行虽然更具挑战性但提供了可扩展和高效的替代方案。

Conclusion: PuzzlePlex能够进行针对性评估，指导基础模型在推理、规划和泛化方面的未来改进。

Abstract: This work investigates the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation
models and their scalability in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce
PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse
set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including
deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as
single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a
comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate
more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we
implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this
benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct
an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings:
instruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
their scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others
in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater
challenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative. PuzzlePlex enables
targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and
generalization for foundation models.

### [9] [Beneficial Reasoning Behaviors in Agentic Search and Effective Post-training to Obtain Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06534)
*Jiahe Jin,Abhijay Paladugu,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了行为引导技术，通过识别四种有益推理行为（信息验证、权威评估、自适应搜索、错误恢复）来训练更有效的智能搜索模型，在多个基准测试中相比直接RL训练获得超过35%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能搜索利用LLMs解释复杂用户信息需求并执行多步骤的规划、搜索和合成过程，但在与检索系统和网络交互时面临推理和智能能力的独特挑战。

Method: 提出推理驱动的LLM管道分析成功智能搜索轨迹，识别四种有益推理行为，然后通过行为引导技术合成展示这些行为的轨迹，通过监督微调和强化学习训练模型。

Result: 在三个基准测试（GAIA、WebWalker、HLE）上，行为引导在Llama3.2-3B和Qwen3-1.7B上相比直接RL训练获得超过35%的性能提升。SFT数据中期望的推理行为而非最终答案正确性是关键因素。

Conclusion: 引入的推理行为赋予模型更有效的探索能力和测试时扩展能力，为强化学习提供了坚实基础。期望推理行为的存在比答案正确性对最终性能更重要。

Abstract: Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex
user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching,
and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces
unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting
with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a
reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior
patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic
search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:
Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error
Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior
Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic
search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into
the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by
standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,
WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in
Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models
with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the
SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical
factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on
trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to
better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our
analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning
behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and
entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a
strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.

### [10] [Auto-Prompt Ensemble for LLM Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06538)
*Jiajie Li,Huayi Zhang,Peng Lin,Jinjun Xiong,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE)框架，通过自动学习评估维度来提升LLM评判者的可靠性，在Reward Bench上将GPT-4o的零样本一致性从87.2%提升到90.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评判者经常遗漏关键评估维度，因为它们无法识别人类评估背后的隐含标准，导致评估可靠性不足。

Method: APE自适应框架自动从失败案例中学习评估维度，采用基于置信度的集成机制，通过Collective Confidence方法决定何时采用额外评估维度的判断。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中，APE显著提升了LLM评判者的可靠性，特别是在Reward Bench上GPT-4o的零样本一致性提升了3.3个百分点。

Conclusion: APE为LLM评判者提供了一种利用测试时计算的原理性方法，弥合了人类与LLM评判者之间的评估差距。

Abstract: We present a novel framework that improves the reliability of LLM judges by
selectively augmenting LLM with auxiliary evaluation dimensions. Existing LLM
judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize
the implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge,
we propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that
automatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE
incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the
judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence
estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse
standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward
Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a
principled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge
the evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebDART是一个LLM代理框架，通过动态分解复杂网页任务为导航、信息提取和执行三个子任务，并持续重新规划，显著提升了长序列网页任务的完成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在简单网页任务上表现良好，但在需要长序列导航、大规模信息提取和约束推理的复杂任务中仍存在困难。

Method: 将目标动态分解为三个专注子任务（导航、信息提取、执行），并随着网页内容揭示持续重新规划分解策略。

Result: 在WebChoreArena上比之前SOTA代理提升13.7个百分点的成功率，在WebArena上保持同等性能，且导航步骤减少多达14.7步。

Conclusion: WebDART框架通过任务分解和动态重新规划，有效解决了LLM代理在复杂网页任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming competent at straightforward
web tasks, such as opening an item page or submitting a form, but still
struggle with objectives that require long horizon navigation, large scale
information extraction, and reasoning under constraints. We present WebDART, a
general framework that enables a single LLM to handle such complex chores.
WebDART (i) dynamically decomposes each objective into three focused subtasks:
navigation, information extraction, and execution, so the model concentrates on
one skill at a time, and (ii) continuously replans the decomposition as new
webpages are revealed, taking advantage of newly discovered filters or
shortcuts and avoiding redundant exploration. Evaluated on WebChoreArena,
WebDART lifts success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA
agents, while matching their performance on the easier WebArena suite and
completing tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.

TL;DR: 本文提出EICL方法，通过引入情感相似示例和动态软标签策略改进细粒度情感识别中的决策过程，显著优于传统ICL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL方法在细粒度情感识别中虽然改进了推理过程，但忽视了决策过程，且语义相似示例常引入情感差异导致错误。

Method: 提出EICL方法：1）引入情感相似示例；2）使用动态软标签策略改进查询表示；3）采用两阶段排除策略从多角度评估相似性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EICL方法显著优于ICL方法。

Conclusion: 通过原型理论优化决策过程，EICL方法有效解决了ICL在细粒度情感识别中的局限性，提升了识别准确性。

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in
queries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role
in various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the
representation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar
examples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the
reasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but
overlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making
in fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL
relies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional
prototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are
critical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional
discrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To
address this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL), which introduces
emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve
query representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion
strategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further
optimizing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments show that EICL
significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了Agent-in-the-Loop框架，通过实时反馈循环持续改进基于LLM的客服系统，将重训练周期从数月缩短至数周。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线方法依赖批量标注，无法实时改进系统。需要将人工反馈直接嵌入运营工作流，实现持续优化。

Method: 在实时客服运营中集成四种关键标注：响应偏好对、客服采纳与理由、知识相关性检查、缺失知识识别，形成数据飞轮。

Result: 生产试点显示检索准确率显著提升（召回率+11.7%，精确率+14.8%），生成质量提高（帮助性+8.4%），客服采纳率增长4.5%。

Conclusion: 将人工反馈循环直接嵌入运营工作流能有效持续改进基于LLM的客服系统，证明了实时反馈机制的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that implements a
continuous data flywheel for iteratively improving an LLM-based customer
support system. Unlike standard offline approaches that rely on batch
annotations, AITL integrates four key types of annotations directly into live
customer operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and
rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing
knowledge. These feedback signals seamlessly feed back into models' updates,
reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks. Our production pilot involving
US-based customer support agents demonstrated significant improvements in
retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality
(+8.4% helpfulness) and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). These results underscore
the effectiveness of embedding human feedback loops directly into operational
workflows to continuously refine LLM-based customer support system.

TL;DR: 本文分析了元代理在自动化设计代理系统时面临的三个关键挑战：跨迭代学习效率、行为多样性不足以及经济可行性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着元代理被用于自动化设计代理系统，需要深入理解其在学习机制、行为多样性和经济成本方面的实际表现和局限性。

Method: 通过实验比较不同学习策略（完全上下文vs忽略历史vs进化方法），评估代理行为多样性，以及分析设计成本与部署规模的经济效益。

Result: 进化方法优于完全上下文方法；设计的代理行为多样性低；仅在少数数据集上自动化设计在经济上可行。

Conclusion: 当前元代理方法在跨迭代学习和行为多样性方面存在显著局限，自动化设计的经济效益仅在特定条件下成立。

Abstract: Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using
meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In
this paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.
First, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that
simply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous
works, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the
performance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the
meta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a
single agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral
diversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess
when automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few
cases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying
the agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over
15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not
justify the design cost, regardless of scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MultiCNKG是一个创新框架，整合了认知神经科学知识图谱、基因本体和疾病本体，利用大语言模型进行实体对齐和语义相似度计算，构建了一个连接基因机制、神经系统疾病和认知功能的统一知识图谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在捕捉基因、疾病和认知过程之间复杂语义关系方面存在局限，大语言模型的出现为整合知识图谱提供了新的可能性。

Method: 整合三个关键知识源：认知神经科学知识图谱(2.9K节点,4.3K边)、基因本体(43K节点,75K边)和疾病本体(11.2K节点,8.8K边)，利用GPT-4等大语言模型进行实体对齐、语义相似度计算和图增强。

Result: 构建的MultiCNKG包含6.9K节点和11.3K边，评估指标显示精度85.20%、召回率87.30%、覆盖率92.18%、图一致性82.50%、新颖性检测40.28%、专家验证89.50%，链接预测性能与基准数据集相当。

Conclusion: 该知识图谱推动了个性化医疗、认知障碍诊断和认知神经科学假设制定等应用，为从分子到行为领域的多层面研究提供了支持。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the integration
of knowledge graphs (KGs) in biomedical and cognitive sciences, overcoming
limitations in traditional machine learning methods for capturing intricate
semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes. We introduce
MultiCNKG, an innovative framework that merges three key knowledge sources: the
Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph (CNKG) with 2.9K nodes and 4.3K edges
across 9 node types and 20 edge types; Gene Ontology (GO) featuring 43K nodes
and 75K edges in 3 node types and 4 edge types; and Disease Ontology (DO)
comprising 11.2K nodes and 8.8K edges with 1 node type and 2 edge types.
Leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we conduct entity alignment, semantic similarity
computation, and graph augmentation to create a cohesive KG that interconnects
genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions. The
resulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes,
Diseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes,
Associated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular
to behavioral domains. Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%),
recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty
detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and
coherence. Link prediction evaluations with models like TransE (MR: 391, MRR:
0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) show competitive performance against
benchmarks like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. This KG advances applications in
personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis
formulation in cognitive neuroscience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个自动化工具，用于验证基于LLM的策略在无记忆顺序决策任务中的安全性，通过增量构建MDP模型并使用Storm模型检查器验证PCTL安全属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在顺序决策任务中的应用日益增多，需要一种严谨的方法来验证这些基于LLM的策略是否满足安全要求，确保其在现实应用中的可靠性。

Method: 给定MDP、LLM策略和PCTL安全要求，增量构建可达的MDP状态，将状态编码为自然语言提示，解析LLM响应为动作，扩展可达后继状态，最后使用Storm模型检查器进行验证。

Result: 实验表明，通过Ollama访问的开源LLM在确定性种子下可以被验证，但性能通常不如深度强化学习基线方法。

Conclusion: 该工具与Ollama原生集成并支持PRISM规范任务，为正式验证日益强大的LLM奠定了实用基础，支持用户在指定顺序决策任务中进行持续基准测试。

Abstract: We introduce a tool for rigorous and automated verification of large language
model (LLM)- based policies in memoryless sequential decision-making tasks.
Given a Markov decision process (MDP) representing the sequential
decision-making task, an LLM policy, and a safety requirement expressed as a
PCTL formula, our approach incrementally constructs only the reachable portion
of the MDP guided by the LLM's chosen actions. Each state is encoded as a
natural language prompt, the LLM's response is parsed into an action, and
reachable successor states by the policy are expanded. The resulting formal
model is checked with Storm to determine whether the policy satisfies the
specified safety property. In experiments on standard grid world benchmarks, we
show that open source LLMs accessed via Ollama can be verified when
deterministically seeded, but generally underperform deep reinforcement
learning baselines. Our tool natively integrates with Ollama and supports
PRISM-specified tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking in user-specified
sequential decision-making tasks and laying a practical foundation for formally
verifying increasingly capable LLMs.

Motivation: 自动化端到端科学研究面临双重挑战：需要生成新颖且合理的高层计划，并在动态不确定条件下正确执行这些计划。

Method: DLMA框架包含领导循环（教授智能体）和跟随循环（博士生智能体）。领导循环使用进化算法通过参与、改进和整合会议迭代生成研究提案；跟随循环通过事前和事后会议动态调整计划执行。

Result: 在ACLAward和Laboratory基准测试中，DLMA生成的研究论文在自动评估中达到最先进分数，显著优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 消融研究证实两个循环的关键作用：进化驱动新颖性，执行确保合理性，DLMA成功解决了自动化科学研究的双层挑战。

Abstract: Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental
challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound,
and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To
address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent
(DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader
loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans.
It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and
integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research
proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop,
composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the
best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via
pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is
well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments
on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research
papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation,
significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the
critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution
ensuring soundness.

Motivation: 解决现有形式化模型在生成语法有效和语义一致的正式语句方面的不足

Method: 结合Lean 4编译器进行语法校正，使用多LLM判断进行一致性验证，通过工具反馈自适应优化生成语句，包含冷启动、专家迭代和直接偏好优化三阶段训练

Result: ATF在实验中显著优于基线模型，表现出优秀的推理扩展特性，并开源了包含75万条合成正式语句的数据集

Conclusion: ATF通过工具反馈机制有效提升了自动形式化的语法有效性和语义一致性，为自动定理证明研究提供了重要进展

Abstract: Autoformalization addresses the scarcity of data for Automated Theorem
Proving (ATP) by translating mathematical problems from natural language into
formal statements. Efforts in recent work shift from directly prompting large
language models to training an end-to-end formalizer model from scratch,
achieving remarkable advancements. However, existing formalizer still struggles
to consistently generate valid statements that meet syntactic validity and
semantic consistency. To address this issue, we propose the Autoformalizer with
Tool Feedback (ATF), a novel approach that incorporates syntactic and
consistency information as tools into the formalization process. By integrating
Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and employing a multi-LLMs-as-judge
approach for consistency validation, the model is able to adaptively refine
generated statements according to the tool feedback, enhancing both syntactic
validity and semantic consistency. The training of ATF involves a cold-start
phase on synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase to improve
formalization capabilities, and Direct Preference Optimization to alleviate
ineffective revisions. Experimental results show that ATF markedly outperforms
a range of baseline formalizer models, with its superior performance further
validated by human evaluations. Subsequent analysis reveals that ATF
demonstrates excellent inference scaling properties. Moreover, we open-source
Numina-ATF, a dataset containing 750K synthetic formal statements to facilitate
advancements in autoformalization and ATP research.

Motivation: 现有迭代精化方法依赖预定义启发式，面临探索-利用困境且无法根据过往结果自适应调整

Method: TGPR框架结合GRPO与Thompson采样树搜索，主动探索失败和成功的精化路径，生成更密集的训练轨迹和自适应策略

Result: 在HumanEval、MBPP和APPS基准测试中，相比GRPO基线，pass@1最高提升4.2个百分点(MBPP)，pass@10最高提升12.51个百分点(APPS)

Conclusion: TGPR为结合学习策略与结构化搜索方法提供了原则性方法，是增强LLM迭代精化和状态推理的通用框架

Abstract: Iterative refinement has been a promising paradigm to enable large language
models (LLMs) to resolve difficult reasoning and problem-solving tasks. One of
the key challenges, however, is how to effectively search through the enormous
search space of possible refinements. Existing methods typically fall back on
predefined heuristics, which are troubled by the exploration-exploitation
dilemma and cannot adapt based on past refinement outcomes. We introduce
Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), a novel framework that combines GRPO with
a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search. TGPR explores both failed and successful
refinement paths actively, with denser training trajectories and more adaptive
policies. On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, our method achieves up to
+4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to
+12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to
a competitive GRPO baseline. Apart from debugging code, TGPR focuses on a
principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search
methods, offering a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and
stateful reasoning in LLMs.

Method: 提出集成开发环境，通过大语言模型辅助智能体工程，降低建模门槛

Result: 开发了能够克服AJAN智能体建模障碍的工具环境

Conclusion: 该集成开发环境解决了语义Web标准在多智能体系统中的实际应用难题，同时利用LLM技术扩大了AJAN框架的用户群体

Abstract: There are many established semantic Web standards for implementing
multi-agent driven applications. The AJAN framework allows to engineer
multi-agent systems based on these standards. In particular, agent knowledge is
represented in RDF/RDFS and OWL, while agent behavior models are defined with
Behavior Trees and SPARQL to access and manipulate this knowledge. However, the
appropriate definition of RDF/RDFS and SPARQL-based agent behaviors still
remains a major hurdle not only for agent modelers in practice. For example,
dealing with URIs is very error-prone regarding typos and dealing with complex
SPARQL queries in large-scale environments requires a high learning curve. In
this paper, we present an integrated development environment to overcome such
hurdles of modeling AJAN agents and at the same time to extend the user
community for AJAN by the possibility to leverage Large Language Models for
agent engineering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型推理轨迹中信息密度的均匀性，发现正确的推理轨迹避免信息密度尖峰，而不正确的轨迹则呈现不规则信息爆发。通过提出的局部和全局均匀性评分，选择信息密度更均匀的推理轨迹可显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视均匀信息密度假说在LLM推理轨迹中的应用，探究步骤级信息密度均匀性是否反映推理质量。

Method: 提出基于熵的步骤级信息密度度量，引入局部和全局均匀性评分两种互补的均匀性衡量方法。

Result: 在六个推理基准测试中，步骤级信息密度均匀性不仅提供理论视角，还带来实际性能提升：选择信息密度更均匀的推理轨迹在AIME2025上相对基线提升准确率10-32%。

Conclusion: UID启发的信息密度度量优于其他内部信号作为推理质量预测指标，信息密度均匀性是构建更可靠、准确推理系统的稳健诊断和选择标准。

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective
communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit
this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces,
asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end,
we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce
two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores.
Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that
step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also
yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces
with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by
10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals
that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,
while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results
demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform
alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results
highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and
selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.

Motivation: 当前语言模型在需要最新知识或计算工具（如计算器、代码解释器）的复杂算术运算任务上表现不佳，需要克服这些限制。

Method: 采用改进的动态采样策略优化（DAPO）强化学习范式，专门针对工具调用场景进行适配，使模型能够动态地在复杂推理与按需工具使用之间切换。

Conclusion: 将高级推理与工具使用相结合，在知识密集型和计算密集型任务中具有显著提升模型性能的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have popularized test-time
scaling, where models generate additional reasoning tokens before producing
final answers. These approaches have demonstrated significant performance
improvements on benchmarks involving mathematical reasoning. However, language
models relying solely on direct inference still struggle with tasks demanding
up-to-date knowledge or computational tools such as calculators and code
interpreters for complex arithmetic operations. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel reinforcement
learning framework that systematically integrates multi-hop reasoning with
adaptive tool-calling capabilities. Our approach employs a modified version of
Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), a recently developed RL paradigm,
which we adapt specifically for tool invocation scenarios, enabling models to
dynamically interleave complex reasoning with on-demand tool usage (including
search APIs and Python interpreters).
  To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and
TAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based
reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Our experiments on
Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
with both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring
external knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable
parameters. Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than
baseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking.
These results highlight the significant potential of combining advanced
reasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive
and computationally demanding tasks.

Conclusion: 通过构建多样化LLM代理集，能够更好地代表人群体多样性，为使用LLMs作为人类行为代理提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: The difficulty and expense of obtaining large-scale human responses make
Large Language Models (LLMs) an attractive alternative and a promising proxy
for human behavior. However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce
homogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human
perspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity
with a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of
agents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population.
Each agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set
of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The
central challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents
from the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection
problem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop
methods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and
performance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational
domains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively
represent human populations compared to baselines. Moreover, behavioral
analyses on new tasks show that these agents reproduce the behavior patterns
and perspectives of the students and annotators they are designed to represent.

Abstract: Possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models are a major
variant of answer set programming (ASP). While its semantics (possibilistic
stable models) and properties have been well investigated, the problem of
inductive reasoning has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an
approach to extracting poss-programs from a background program and examples
(parts of intended possibilistic stable models). To this end, the notion of
induction tasks is first formally defined, its properties are investigated and
two algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin for computing induction solutions are
presented. An implementation of ilpsmmin is also provided and experimental
results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype
outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from
stable models on the datasets that are randomly generated.

Abstract: Designing high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is a
complex task that requires both intuition and deep domain knowledge. Large
language model (LLM)-based code generation has recently shown promise across
many domains, but it still falls short of producing heuristics that rival those
crafted by human experts. In this paper, we propose VRPAgent, a framework that
integrates LLM-generated components into a metaheuristic and refines them
through a novel genetic search. By using the LLM to generate problem-specific
operators, embedded within a generic metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent keeps
tasks manageable, guarantees correctness, and still enables the discovery of
novel and powerful strategies. Across multiple problems, including the
capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, and the prize-collecting VRP, our
method discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and
recent learning-based approaches while requiring only a single CPU core. To our
knowledge, \VRPAgent is the first LLM-based paradigm to advance the
state-of-the-art in VRPs, highlighting a promising future for automated
heuristics discovery.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了两种动作表示方法在长视野任务中的有效性：基于动作的规划（PwA）和基于模式的规划（PwS），发现在动作空间规模扩大时存在表示选择转折点，并提出了构建更强大PwS智能体的实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当环境动作空间组合爆炸时（如开放世界），传统的基于动作列表的规划方法变得不切实际，需要寻找最优的动作表示方法来实现可扩展的长视野自主性。

Method: 系统比较PwA（直接提供可执行动作列表）和PwS（将动作模式实例化为动作列表）两种表示方法，提出认知带宽视角作为概念框架，并在ALFWorld（~35动作）和SciWorld（~500动作）环境中进行实证研究。

Result: 观察到在ALFWorld和SciWorld之间存在表示选择转折点，证明了可扩展表示的必要性。更强的规划能力使转折点右移，而更好的模式实例化能力使其左移。

Conclusion: PwS在当前表现欠佳，但提供了构建更强大PwS智能体的实用指南，以实现更好的可扩展自主性。

Abstract: Enabling LLMs to effectively operate long-horizon task which requires
long-term planning and multiple interactions is essential for open-world
autonomy. Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable
action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation
choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial
exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As
environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation
for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the
effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is
conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its
effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas
(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ]
to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable
scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human
cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format
restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual
framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action
representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection
point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve
as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct
controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point
interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts
the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it
leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide
an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable
autonomy.

Abstract: Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be
avoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to
open-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological
organisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical
world with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the
conditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,
adaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions
for physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin
Heidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and
being-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal
states due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these
conditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining
integrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an
intrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing
inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,
we examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,
empowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to

Abstract: Process discovery aims to derive process models from event logs, providing
insights into operational behavior and forming a foundation for conformance
checking and process improvement. However, models derived solely from event
data may not accurately reflect the real process, as event logs are often
incomplete or affected by noise, and domain knowledge, an important
complementary resource, is typically disregarded. As a result, the discovered
models may lack reliability for downstream tasks. We propose an interactive
framework that incorporates domain knowledge, expressed in natural language,
into the process discovery pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
approach leverages LLMs to extract declarative rules from textual descriptions
provided by domain experts. These rules are used to guide the IMr discovery
algorithm, which recursively constructs process models by combining insights
from both the event log and the extracted rules, helping to avoid problematic
process structures that contradict domain knowledge. The framework coordinates
interactions among the LLM, domain experts, and a set of backend services. We
present a fully implemented tool that supports this workflow and conduct an
extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies. Our
empirical study includes a case study based on a real-life event log with the
involvement of domain experts, who assessed the usability and effectiveness of
the framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学定律发现基准存在评估三难问题（科学相关性、可扩展性、抗记忆性），且过度简化发现过程为静态函数拟合，未能捕捉真实科学探索过程。

Method: 采用元物理变换（对标准定律进行系统性改变）生成大量问题，构建包含12个物理领域的324个任务，要求智能体通过实验探索模拟复杂系统来发现隐藏原理。

Result: 前沿大语言模型展现出清晰但脆弱的发现能力：随着系统复杂性增加而急剧下降，对观测噪声极其敏感。工具辅助产生悖论效应：代码解释器可能阻碍更有能力的模型，使其过早从探索转向利用。

Conclusion: 在复杂交互环境中实现稳健、可泛化的发现仍是核心挑战。牛顿基准为衡量真实进展和开发下一代真正科学发现AI智能体提供了关键工具。

Abstract: Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law
discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing
benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,
forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance
to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function
fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering
embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising
324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design
mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic
alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are
scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we
elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model
discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems
to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but
fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades
precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme
sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of
tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by
inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to
satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,
generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core
challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic
testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and
guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine
scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于词典序偏好的多目标多智能体路径规划框架LCBS，直接计算符合用户偏好排序的最优解，避免了帕累托前沿构建，显著提升了多目标情况下的规划效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多目标多智能体路径规划算法通常通过计算帕累托前沿来生成无冲突路径，但无法直接优化用户定义的偏好，且在目标数量增加时扩展性差。

Method: 提出了词典序冲突搜索算法(LCBS)，将优先级感知的低层A*搜索与基于冲突的搜索相结合，直接根据目标偏好进行高效规划。

Result: LCBS能够计算最优解，并扩展到最多10个目标的情况，远超过现有方法的限制。在标准和随机MAPF基准测试中，随着目标数量增加，成功率始终高于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 词典序框架为多目标多智能体路径规划提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，能够直接利用用户偏好进行规划，避免了帕累托前沿的计算负担。

Abstract: Many real-world scenarios require multiple agents to coordinate in shared
environments, while balancing trade-offs between multiple, potentially
competing objectives. Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding
(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto
frontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even
when the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of
objectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along
with an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that
directly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference
over objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with
conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling
efficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights
into optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes
optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far
beyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard and
randomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates against
state-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.

Abstract: Generative AI has unlocked new possibilities in content discovery and

demonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and
analysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than
traditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user
query as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the
underlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved
through carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95
percent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10
minutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational
efficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and
engaging storylines.

Result: 在2024年（当前情景）和2035年（零碳情景）的模拟显示：提出的模型相比行业标准可节省高达28%的运行成本；水电储能在未来将发挥关键作用；构网型逆变器在投资回报方面显著优于同步调相机。

Conclusion: 水电储能在电力系统脱碳中具有重要价值，提出的频率约束机组组合模型能有效降低运行成本，构网型逆变器是比同步调相机更具经济效益的频率调节技术选择。

Abstract: The increasing participation of renewable energy sources in power systems has
entailed a series of challenges resulting from the replacement of conventional
synchronous machines with carbon-free Inverter-Based-Resources (IBRs). In this
context, the present work contributes to the existing literature on
Frequency-Constrained Unit Commitment (FCUC) models by studying the role of
hydro-reservoirs in the ongoing decarbonization of power systems. For this
purpose, a novel FCUC model is developed, which captures hydro-reservoir
dynamics and their impact on frequency Nadir requirements through a data-driven
approach. Moreover, the proposed FCUC model is used to simulate a series of
future scenarios in the Chilean power system, and to understand the role that
hydro-power units, thermal units, Grid-Forming (GFM) inverters, and Synchronous
Condensers (SCs) will play in the future in terms of frequency regulation.
Exhaustive simulations on the Chilean power system for years 2024 (current
scenario) and 2035 (carbon-free scenario) illustrate the benefits of the
proposed approach, which include: (i) significant cost-savings resulting from
the using the proposed FCUC model relative to the industry standard, achieving
operational cost reductions of up to 28% without compromising system security;
and (ii) providing insights into the key role that hydro-reservoirs will play
in the future. As a final analysis, the developed FCUC model is used to
evaluate the financial benefits of incorporating SCs and GFM inverters to
provide frequency regulation support to the grid in 2035. The results show
that, while both technologies contribute to reducing the system's annual
operational costs, GFM inverters significantly outperform SCs in terms of
investment return.

Motivation: 研究具有高阶动态移动边界的Stefan PDE模型的安全稳定控制问题，旨在设计边界热通量控制来稳定移动边界，同时满足模型对PDE状态和移动边界的约束条件。

Method: 应用PDE反步法进行控制设计，考虑控制律约束，通过抛物型PDE的最大值原理验证PDE和移动边界约束的满足性，并通过Lyapunov分析证明闭环系统的全局指数稳定性。

Conclusion: 成功开发了一种用于高阶动态移动边界Stefan PDE模型的安全稳定控制方法，该方法能有效稳定移动边界并满足所有约束条件，且可扩展到三阶移动边界动态。

Abstract: This paper presents a safe stabilization of the Stefan PDE model with a
moving boundary governed by a high-order dynamics. We consider a parabolic PDE
with a time-varying domain governed by a second-order response with respect to
the Neumann boundary value of the PDE state at the moving boundary. The
objective is to design a boundary heat flux control to stabilize the moving
boundary at a desired setpoint, with satisfying the required conditions of the
model on PDE state and the moving boundary. We apply a PDE backstepping method
for the control design with considering a constraint on the control law. The
PDE and moving boundary constraints are shown to be satisfied by applying the
maximum principle for parabolic PDEs. Then the closed-loop system is shown to
be globally exponentially stable by performing Lyapunov analysis. The proposed
control is implemented in numerical simulation, which illustrates the desired
performance in safety and stability. An outline of the extension to third-order
moving boundary dynamics is also presented. Code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然ABPG算法能在光滑部分缺乏全局Lipschitz连续梯度时收敛到稳定点，但其依赖Armijo线搜索会降低实际性能，需要改进以克服这一限制。

Method: 提出了带有变度量Armijo-Wolfe线搜索的ABPG算法，在变度量Armijo-Wolfe条件下保证全局收敛性。

Result: 数值实验表明，在ℓ_p正则化最小二乘问题和非负线性逆问题上，该算法优于现有算法。

Conclusion: 新算法不仅保持了ABPG的收敛性优势，还通过改进线搜索策略显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: We propose a variant of the approximate Bregman proximal gradient (ABPG)
algorithm for minimizing the sum of a smooth nonconvex function and a nonsmooth
convex function. Although ABPG is known to converge globally to a stationary
point even when the smooth part of the objective function lacks globally
Lipschitz continuous gradients, and its iterates can often be expressed in
closed form, ABPG relies on an Armijo line search to guarantee global
convergence. Such reliance can slow down performance in practice. To overcome
this limitation, we propose the ABPG with a variable metric Armijo--Wolfe line
search. Under the variable metric Armijo--Wolfe condition, we establish the
global subsequential convergence of our algorithm. Moreover, assuming the
Kurdyka--\L{}ojasiewicz property, we also establish that our algorithm globally
converges to a stationary point. Numerical experiments on $\ell_p$ regularized
least squares problems and nonnegative linear inverse problems demonstrate that
our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms.

Abstract: In this work, we study the affine-constrained $\ell_1$ regularizers, which
frequently arise in statistical and machine learning problems across a variety
of applications, including microbiome compositional data analysis and sparse
subspace clustering. With the aim of developing scalable second-order methods
for solving optimization problems involving such regularizers, we analyze the
associated proximal mapping and characterize its generalized differentiability,
with a focus on its B-subdifferential. The revealed structured sparsity in the
B-subdifferential enables us to design efficient algorithms within the proximal
point framework. Extensive numerical experiments on real applications,
including comparisons with state-of-the-art solvers, further demonstrate the
superior performance of our approach. Our findings provide new insights into
the sensitivity and stability properties of affine-constrained nonsmooth
regularizers, and contribute to the development of fast second-order methods
for a class of structured, constrained sparse learning problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最优传输和薛定谔桥方法通常只关注端点匹配，忽略了路径相关特性（特别是多智能体系统中的碰撞避免），这限制了它们在机器人学、经济学等需要智能体交互的领域中的实际应用。

Method: 使用流匹配作为核心建模工具，其中流模型与控制策略共同演化。该方法明确优化整个传输路径，能够纳入轨迹相关成本和碰撞避免约束，将最优传输理论与平均场控制相结合。

Conclusion: 该框架为多智能体协调问题提供了原则性方法，其中端点对齐和路径特性都至关重要，有效解决了现有方法在路径依赖特性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and Schr{\"o}dinger bridge (SB) problems have emerged
as powerful frameworks for transferring probability distributions with minimal
cost. However, existing approaches typically focus on endpoint matching while
neglecting critical path-dependent properties -- particularly collision
avoidance in multiagent systems -- which limits their practical applicability
in robotics, economics, and other domains where inter-agent interactions are
essential. Moreover, traditional density control methods often rely on
independence assumptions that fail to capture swarm dynamics. We propose a
novel framework that addresses these limitations by employing flow matching as
the core modeling tool, where the flow model co-evolves with the control
policy. Unlike prior methods that treat transport trajectories as mere
interpolations between source and target distributions, our approach explicitly
optimizes over the entire transport path, enabling the incorporation of
trajectory-dependent costs and collision avoidance constraints. Our framework
bridges optimal transport theory with mean field control, providing a
principled approach to multiagent coordination problems where both endpoint
alignment and path properties are critical. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method successfully generates collision-free transport plans while
maintaining computational efficiency comparable to standard flow matching
approaches.

Method: 采用组合方法，使用最小化连续优化理论，将SDP重新表述为秩揭示形式，并通过初等行操作和旋转连接Ramana对偶与正则面缩减序列。

Result: 完全刻画了Ramana对偶的可行解集，证明其是高维精确对偶的表示，并发现严格可行性意味着原问题只有零矩阵解。

Conclusion: 提供了Ramana对偶的简洁透明推导，建立了对偶可行解与正则面缩减序列的对应关系，使该理论更易被优化和理论计算机科学界理解。

Abstract: Thirty years ago, in a seminal paper Ramana derived an exact dual for
Semidefinite Programming (SDP). Ramana's dual has the following remarkable
features: i) it is an explicit, polynomial size semidefinite program ii) it
does not assume that the primal is strictly feasible, nor does it make any
other regularity assumptions iii) yet, it has strong duality with the primal.
The complexity implications of Ramana's dual are fundamental, and to date still
the best known. The most important of these is that SDP feasibility in the
Turing model is not NP-complete, unless NP = co-NP.
  We give a treatment of Ramana's dual which is both simpler and more complete,
than was previously available. First we connect it to a seemingly very
different way of inducing strong duality: reformulating the SDP into a rank
revealing form using elementary row operations and rotations. Second, while
previous works characterized its objective value, we completely characterize
its feasible set: in particular, we show it is a higher dimensional
representation of an exact dual, which, however is not an explicit SDP. We also
prove that -- somewhat surprisingly -- strict feasibility of Ramana's dual
implies that the only feasible solution of the primal is the zero matrix.
  As a corollary, we obtain a short and transparent derivation of Ramana's
dual, which we believe is accessible to both the optimization and the
theoretical computer science communities. Our approach is combinatorial in the
following sense: i) we use a minimum amount of continuous optimization theory
ii) we show that feasible solutions in Ramana's dual are identified with
regular facial reduction sequences, i.e., essentially discrete structures.

TL;DR: RareGraph-Synth是一个基于知识图谱引导的连续时间扩散框架，用于生成真实且保护隐私的超罕见疾病电子健康记录轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决超罕见疾病研究中数据稀缺和隐私保护的问题，需要生成既真实又能保护患者隐私的合成电子健康记录数据。

Method: 整合五个公共资源构建异质知识图谱，使用元路径分数调节扩散模型的前向噪声调度，引导生成生物学上合理的实验室-药物-不良事件共现模式。

Result: 在模拟超罕见疾病队列上，相比无引导扩散基线降低分类最大均值差异40%，相比GAN方法降低60%以上，同时保持下游预测效用。成员推理攻击的AUROC约为0.53，远低于安全发布阈值0.55。

Conclusion: 将生物医学知识图谱直接集成到扩散噪声调度中可以同时提高保真度和隐私性，为罕见疾病研究实现更安全的数据共享。

Abstract: We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion
framework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic
electronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases.
RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human
Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph
comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this
8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward
stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically
plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining
score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces
timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag
triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated
ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean
Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by
greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream
predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the
DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55
safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61
plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong
resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating
biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can
simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for
rare-disease research.

Conclusion: MCCE展示了混合LLM系统中实现持续进化的新范式，结合了知识驱动的探索和经验驱动的学习。

Abstract: Multi-objective discrete optimization problems, such as molecular design,
pose significant challenges due to their vast and unstructured combinatorial
spaces. Traditional evolutionary algorithms often get trapped in local optima,
while expert knowledge can provide crucial guidance for accelerating
convergence. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful priors and reasoning
ability, making them natural optimizers when expert knowledge matters. However,
closed-source LLMs, though strong in exploration, cannot update their
parameters and thus cannot internalize experience. Conversely, smaller open
models can be continually fine-tuned but lack broad knowledge and reasoning
strength. We introduce Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE), a hybrid
framework that unites a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable
model. The system maintains a trajectory memory of past search processes; the
small model is progressively refined via reinforcement learning, with the two
models jointly supporting and complementing each other in global exploration.
Unlike model distillation, this process enhances the capabilities of both
models through mutual inspiration. Experiments on multi-objective drug design
benchmarks show that MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality and
consistently outperforms baselines. These results highlight a new paradigm for
enabling continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, combining knowledge-driven
exploration with experience-driven learning.

Conclusion: RVFL-X通过将复数组件集成到随机神经网络中，成功解决了实数值数据集转换为复数值表示的挑战，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural networks, supported by foundational theoretical
insights, emphasize the superior representational power of complex numbers.
However, their adoption in randomized neural networks (RNNs) has been limited
due to the lack of effective methods for transforming real-valued tabular
datasets into complex-valued representations. To address this limitation, we
propose two methods for generating complex-valued representations from
real-valued datasets: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven
method. Building on these mechanisms, we propose RVFL-X, a complex-valued
extension of the random vector functional link (RVFL) network. RVFL-X
integrates complex transformations into real-valued datasets while maintaining
the simplicity and efficiency of the original RVFL architecture. By leveraging
complex components such as input, weights, and activation functions, RVFL-X
processes complex representations and produces real-valued outputs.
Comprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate that
RVFL-X consistently outperforms both the original RVFL and state-of-the-art
(SOTA) RNN variants, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness across diverse
application domains.

Conclusion: 两阶段方法展示了机器学习处理噪声视觉数据与传统不变量确保拓扑区分之间的互补性，为实现绳结自动识别提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically
recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate
this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular
convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and
traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones
polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly
from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures
can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to
combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar
diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot
classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between
machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which
enforce rigorous topological distinctions.

Conclusion: Transformer架构在轨迹生成任务中表现出色，能够生成更高质量的轨迹并解决传统方法的偏差问题。

Abstract: The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data
mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and
generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and
privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for
high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on
convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the
diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of
fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper,
we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer
backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We
explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and
longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different
scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory
Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively
alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.

Result: 与传统一维蒙特卡洛优化方案相比，该方法需要40倍更少的数据点，计算成本最多降低40倍。

Conclusion: 通过计算工程中的两个数值示例证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a challenging problem especially when the system
itself involves uncertainty. Due to noisy function evaluations, optimization
under uncertainty can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a
novel Bayesian optimization framework tailored for hyperparameter tuning under
uncertainty, with a focus on optimizing a scale- or precision-type parameter in
stochastic models. The proposed method employs a statistical surrogate for the
underlying random variable, enabling analytical evaluation of the expectation
operator. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimizer of the
random acquisition function, which significantly reduces computational cost per
iteration. Compared with a conventional one-dimensional Monte Carlo-based
optimization scheme, the proposed approach requires 40 times fewer data points,
resulting in up to a 40-fold reduction in computational cost. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method through two numerical examples in
computational engineering.

Conclusion: BlockGPT为降水临近预报提供了一种高效准确的解决方案，通过创新的空间-时间分解方法实现了优越的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Predicting precipitation maps is a highly complex spatiotemporal modeling
task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term
precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only
accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current
methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed
inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be
computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT,
a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block)
method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step.
Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT
factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal
attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation
nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI
(Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines
including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet)
models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event
localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x
faster than comparable baselines.

TL;DR: Medix是一个新颖的OOD检测框架，使用中位数操作从未标记数据中识别潜在异常值，然后结合标记的InD数据训练鲁棒的OOD分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中未标记数据通常混合了InD和OOD样本，缺乏明确的OOD样本集使得训练最优OOD分类器变得困难。

Method: 利用中位数操作的稳定性从未标记数据中识别异常值，然后使用这些识别出的异常值和标记InD数据训练OOD分类器。

Result: 理论分析显示Medix实现了低错误率，实证结果表明在开放世界设置中全面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Medix通过中位数操作有效识别异常值，结合理论保证和实证验证，为OOD检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the
robustness and reliability of machine learning systems deployed in real-world
applications. Recent approaches have explored the use of unlabeled data,
showing potential for enhancing OOD detection capabilities. However,
effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data remains challenging due to the
mixed nature of both in-distribution (InD) and OOD samples. The lack of a
distinct set of OOD samples complicates the task of training an optimal OOD
classifier. In this work, we introduce Medix, a novel framework designed to
identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation. We
use the median because it provides a stable estimate of the central tendency,
as an OOD detection mechanism, due to its robustness against noise and
outliers. Using these identified outliers, along with labeled InD data, we
train a robust OOD classifier. From a theoretical perspective, we derive error
bounds that demonstrate Medix achieves a low error rate. Empirical results
further substantiate our claims, as Medix outperforms existing methods across
the board in open-world settings, confirming the validity of our theoretical
insights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDAR提出了一种协同扩散-自回归范式，将自回归模型的训练效率与扩散模型的并行推理能力相结合，通过轻量级范式转换实现高效AR到扩散模型的转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在结合自回归模型的高训练效率和扩散模型的并行推理优势，避免昂贵的端到端扩散训练成本。

Method: 通过轻量级范式转换将训练好的自回归模型转换为块级扩散模型，推理时在块间自回归生成以保证全局一致性，在块内通过离散扩散过程并行解码所有token。

Result: SDAR在保持自回归模型性能的同时实现了并行生成，30B MoE模型在GPQA和ChemBench等科学推理基准上超越了其自回归对应模型，并通过多数投票和pass@k等测试时缩放方法获得进一步改进。

Conclusion: SDAR建立了一个实用的范式，结合了自回归和扩散的优势，实现了可扩展的高吞吐量推理。

Abstract: We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies
the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference
capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR
performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained
autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief,
data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences
autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens
within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive
experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient
than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.
Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion
with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel
generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures
confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger
robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups
without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning
and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on
challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and
gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting
and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that
combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable,
high-throughput reasoning.

### [49] [AutoBalance: An Automatic Balancing Framework for Training Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06684)
*Kang An,Chenhao Si,Ming Yan,Shiqian Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoBalance是一种新的PINNs训练范式，通过为每个损失分量分配独立的自适应优化器，并在之后聚合预条件更新，解决了传统PINNs训练中多损失项平衡困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs训练困难，因为需要平衡多个具有冲突目标和不同曲率的损失项（如PDE残差和边界条件）。现有方法在优化前操纵梯度（"预组合"策略）存在根本限制，因为强制单个优化器处理谱异质损失景观会破坏其内部预条件。

Method: 提出AutoBalance，一种"后组合"训练范式：为每个损失分量分配独立的自适应优化器，然后在之后聚合得到的预条件更新。

Result: 在具有挑战性的PDE基准测试中，AutoBalance始终优于现有框架，在MSE和L∞范数测量下显著降低解误差。

Conclusion: AutoBalance与其它流行的PINN方法正交且互补，能在要求高的基准测试中增强其有效性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a powerful and general
framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by embedding
physical laws into loss functions. However, training PINNs is notoriously
difficult due to the need to balance multiple loss terms, such as PDE residuals
and boundary conditions, which often have conflicting objectives and vastly
different curvatures. Existing methods address this issue by manipulating
gradients before optimization (a "pre-combine" strategy). We argue that this
approach is fundamentally limited, as forcing a single optimizer to process
gradients from spectrally heterogeneous loss landscapes disrupts its internal
preconditioning. In this work, we introduce AutoBalance, a novel "post-combine"
training paradigm. AutoBalance assigns an independent adaptive optimizer to
each loss component and aggregates the resulting preconditioned updates
afterwards. Extensive experiments on challenging PDE benchmarks show that
AutoBalance consistently outperforms existing frameworks, achieving significant
reductions in solution error, as measured by both the MSE and $L^{\infty}$
norms. Moreover, AutoBalance is orthogonal to and complementary with other
popular PINN methodologies, amplifying their effectiveness on demanding
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文分析了基础模型在动态环境中的局限性，提出分散式小代理网络架构作为替代方案，认为群体学习能实现优于单一基础模型的决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在复杂动态系统（如重症监护）中表现有限，需要开发能在数据有限、机制知识不足情况下自我适应的AI方法。

Method: 提出分散式小代理网络架构，每个代理覆盖系统功能的子集，通过群体学习实现自我适应。

Result: 分散式小代理网络在动态环境中能提供优于单一基础模型的决策能力，但牺牲了细节的可重现性。

Conclusion: 在基础模型承担更广泛决策角色前，AI需要在复杂动态环境中证明其明确优势，分散式架构是更有前景的方向。

Abstract: Foundation models have rapidly advanced AI, raising the question of whether
their decisions will ultimately surpass human strategies in real-world domains.
The exponential, and possibly super-exponential, pace of AI development makes
such analysis elusive. Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for
daily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is
diagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.
  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments.
Effective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly
interacting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires
reliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins
of highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively
understood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI
models with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge
extends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these
settings before assuming broader decision-making roles.
  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient
self-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual
limits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized
architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents
representing the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent
covers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical
results on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing
applications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable
self-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments
compared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced
reproducibility in detail.

Motivation: 尽管MoE架构在现代AI系统中广泛应用，但对其训练动态的理论理解仍局限于分离的专家-路由器优化或特定路由场景。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 在师生框架下分析软路由MoE模型的联合训练，考虑非线性路由器和专家，证明在适度过参数化下的收敛性。

Result: 证明了学生网络通过特征学习阶段能够恢复教师网络参数，后训练剪枝可有效消除冗余神经元，微调过程可收敛到全局最优。

Conclusion: 这是首个深入理解MoE架构优化景观的分析，为软路由MoE模型的联合训练提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a cornerstone of
modern AI systems. In particular, MoEs route inputs dynamically to specialized
experts whose outputs are aggregated through weighted summation. Despite their
widespread application, theoretical understanding of MoE training dynamics
remains limited to either separate expert-router optimization or only top-1
routing scenarios with carefully constructed datasets. This paper advances MoE
theory by providing convergence guarantees for joint training of soft-routed
MoE models with non-linear routers and experts in a student-teacher framework.
We prove that, with moderate over-parameterization, the student network
undergoes a feature learning phase, where the router's learning process is
``guided'' by the experts, that recovers the teacher's parameters. Moreover, we
show that a post-training pruning can effectively eliminate redundant neurons,
followed by a provably convergent fine-tuning process that reaches global
optimality. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to bring novel insights
in understanding the optimization landscape of the MoE architecture.

Motivation: 无人机通信需要准确且可解释的空对地信道模型，现有确定性模型和深度学习模型分别在可解释性和准确性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出物理启发的Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(PIKAN)，将自由空间路径损耗、双射线反射等物理原理作为灵活归纳偏置嵌入学习过程。

Result: 在无人机A2G测量数据上，PIKAN达到与深度学习模型相当的精度，仅需232个参数，比多层感知机轻37倍，同时提供符号化可解释表达式。

Conclusion: PIKAN是面向5G和6G网络的高效、可解释、可扩展的无人机信道建模解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications demand accurate yet
interpretable air-to-ground (A2G) channel models that can adapt to
nonstationary propagation environments. While deterministic models offer
interpretability and deep learning (DL) models provide accuracy, both
approaches suffer from either rigidity or a lack of explainability. To bridge
this gap, we propose the Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN)
that embeds physical principles (e.g., free-space path loss, two-ray
reflections) into the learning process. Unlike physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs), PIKAN is more flexible for applying physical information because it
introduces them as flexible inductive biases. Thus, it enables a more flexible
training process. Experiments on UAV A2G measurement data show that PIKAN
achieves comparable accuracy to DL models while providing symbolic and
explainable expressions aligned with propagation laws. Remarkably, PIKAN
achieves this performance with only 232 parameters, making it up to 37 times
lighter than multilayer perceptron (MLP) baselines with thousands of
parameters, without sacrificing correlation with measurements and also
providing symbolic expressions. These results highlight PIKAN as an efficient,
interpretable, and scalable solution for UAV channel modelling in beyond-5G and
6G networks.

Motivation: 神经ODE是强大的机器学习技术，但并非所有解都是物理的（即欧拉-拉格朗日方程）。需要量化ODE与物理系统的相似度。

Method: 使用Helmholtz指标量化ODE与欧拉-拉格朗日方程的相似度，结合二阶神经ODE构建拉格朗日神经ODE，仅使用位置数据学习。

Result: 能够区分拉格朗日和非拉格朗日系统，并在有噪声的基本系统上验证了方法的有效性，改善了神经ODE的解。

Conclusion: 拉格朗日神经ODE能够直接学习欧拉-拉格朗日方程，零额外推理成本，且能提高神经ODE解的物理准确性。

Abstract: Neural ODEs are a widely used, powerful machine learning technique in
particular for physics. However, not every solution is physical in that it is
an Euler-Lagrange equation. We present Helmholtz metrics to quantify this
resemblance for a given ODE and demonstrate their capabilities on several
fundamental systems with noise. We combine them with a second order neural ODE
to form a Lagrangian neural ODE, which allows to learn Euler-Lagrange equations
in a direct fashion and with zero additional inference cost. We demonstrate
that, using only positional data, they can distinguish Lagrangian and
non-Lagrangian systems and improve the neural ODE solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了关系变换器（RT）架构，可在不同关系数据库上预训练，并直接应用于未见过的数据集和任务，无需特定微调或上下文示例检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关系数据领域缺乏跨数据集和任务迁移的架构问题，核心挑战是关系数据的多样性，包括异构模式、图结构和函数依赖。

Method: RT通过（i）使用表/列元数据对单元格进行标记化，（ii）通过掩码标记预测进行预训练，（iii）采用新颖的关系注意力机制覆盖列、行和主外键链接。

Result: 在RelBench数据集上预训练后，RT在零样本设置下达到强大性能，二元分类任务平均达到94%的完全监督AUROC，仅需2200万参数模型的单次前向传播，而270亿参数LLM仅为84%。微调后可获得最先进结果且样本效率高。

Conclusion: RT为零样本迁移提供了实用路径，利用了任务-表上下文、关系注意力模式和模式语义，为关系数据的基础模型开辟了可行途径。

Abstract: Pretrained transformers readily adapt to new sequence modeling tasks via
zero-shot prompting, but relational domains still lack architectures that
transfer across datasets and tasks. The core challenge is the diversity of
relational data, with varying heterogeneous schemas, graph structures and
functional dependencies. In this paper, we present the Relational Transformer
(RT) architecture, which can be pretrained on diverse relational databases and
directly applied to unseen datasets and tasks without task- or dataset-specific
fine-tuning, or retrieval of in-context examples. RT (i) tokenizes cells with
table/column metadata, (ii) is pretrained via masked token prediction, and
(iii) utilizes a novel \textit{Relational Attention} mechanism over columns,
rows, and primary-foreign key links. Pretrained on RelBench datasets spanning
tasks such as churn and sales forecasting, RT attains strong zero-shot
performance, averaging 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification
tasks with a single forward pass of a 22M parameter model, as opposed to 84%
for a 27B LLM. Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample
efficiency. Our experiments show that RT's zero-shot transfer harnesses
task-table context, relational attention patterns and schema semantics.
Overall, RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational
data.

TL;DR: MCPS是一种改进GRAVE算法的通用MCTS算法，适用于无法使用深度强化学习或计算资源有限的情况。通过在节点探索项中包含从根节点到该节点路径上所有走法的统计信息，MCPS在多种游戏中表现优于GRAVE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无法使用深度强化学习或计算资源有限的情况下（如通用游戏博弈），需要改进现有的MCTS算法。GRAVE算法存在超参数敏感性问题，需要更好的替代方案。

Method: 提出MCPS算法，在节点探索项中包含从根节点到该节点路径上所有走法的统计信息。使用抽象代码代替精确代码来改进置换统计和AMAF统计，并提供数学推导的统计权重公式。

Result: 在多种游戏（棋盘游戏、战争游戏、投资游戏、视频游戏和多人游戏）上测试，MCPS在双人游戏中表现优于GRAVE，在多人游戏中表现相当。算法不再使用GRAVE的偏置超参数，且对ref超参数不敏感。

Conclusion: MCPS是GRAVE的有效改进，在双人游戏中表现更好，消除了偏置超参数需求，对ref超参数不敏感，适用于计算资源有限的场景。

Abstract: We propose Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS), a general-purpose Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that improves upon the GRAVE algorithm. MCPS
is relevant when deep reinforcement learning is not an option, or when the
computing power available before play is not substantial, such as in General
Game Playing, for example. The principle of MCPS is to include in the
exploration term of a node the statistics on all the playouts that contain all
the moves on the path from the root to the node. We extensively test MCPS on a
variety of games: board games, wargame, investment game, video game and
multi-player games. MCPS has better results than GRAVE in all the two-player
games. It has equivalent results for multi-player games because these games are
inherently balanced even when players have different strengths. We also show
that using abstract codes for moves instead of exact codes can be beneficial to
both MCPS and GRAVE, as they improve the permutation statistics and the AMAF
statistics. We also provide a mathematical derivation of the formulas used for
weighting the three sources of statistics. These formulas are an improvement on
the GRAVE formula since they no longer use the bias hyperparameter of GRAVE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于多分类预测任务的完全真实校准度量，推广了Hartline等人的二元预测工作，并证明该度量具有真实性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有校准度量大多是非真实的，会激励预测器通过说谎来显得更校准。虽然Hartline等人提出了二元预测的完全真实度量，但多分类任务仍缺乏类似的真实度量。

Method: 将二元预测的真实校准度量推广到多分类任务，研究从二元到多分类的扩展方法，识别哪些方法能保持真实性。

Result: 提出的多分类校准度量是完全真实的，并且在数学证明和实证验证中表现出优越的鲁棒性，能稳健地保持主导和从属预测器之间的排序关系。

Conclusion: 成功设计了首个多分类预测的完全真实校准度量，解决了分箱ECE的非鲁棒性问题，为多分类校准提供了可靠评估工具。

Abstract: Calibrated predictions can be reliably interpreted as probabilities. An
important step towards achieving better calibration is to design an appropriate
calibration measure to meaningfully assess the miscalibration level of a
predictor. A recent line of work initiated by Haghtalab et al. [2024] studies
the design of truthful calibration measures: a truthful measure is minimized
when a predictor outputs the true probabilities, whereas a non-truthful measure
incentivizes the predictor to lie so as to appear more calibrated. All previous
calibration measures were non-truthful until Hartline et al. [2025] introduced
the first perfectly truthful calibration measures for binary prediction tasks
in the batch setting.
  We introduce a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class
prediction tasks, generalizing the work of Hartline et al. [2025] beyond binary
prediction. We study common methods of extending calibration measures from
binary to multi-class prediction and identify ones that do or do not preserve
truthfulness. In addition to truthfulness, we mathematically prove and
empirically verify that our calibration measure exhibits superior robustness:
it robustly preserves the ordering between dominant and dominated predictors,
regardless of the choice of hyperparameters (bin sizes). This result addresses
the non-robustness issue of binned ECE, which has been observed repeatedly in
prior work.

*Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文揭示了非欧几里得基础模型在双曲几何等弯曲空间中存在的边界驱动不对称性，这种几何特性使得后门触发器能够利用边界附近的小输入变化产生不成比例的大表示空间偏移，从而逃避标准输入空间检测器的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着非欧几里得基础模型在弯曲空间（如双曲几何）中表示的应用日益增多，需要理解这些几何特性带来的安全漏洞。论文旨在揭示弯曲几何如何创建边界驱动的不对称性，使后门攻击能够利用这种几何特性。

Method: 通过理论分析形式化了边界附近小输入变化在表示空间中产生大偏移的效应，提出了一种简单的几何自适应触发器，并在多个任务和架构上进行了评估。

Result: 实证结果显示，攻击成功率随着接近边界而增加，而传统检测器的效果减弱，这与理论趋势一致。通过沿半径向内拉点的防御方法可以抑制此类触发器，但会牺牲模型在该方向上的有用敏感性。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了非欧几里得模型中特定于几何的脆弱性，并为设计和理解防御的局限性提供了分析支持的指导。

Abstract: Non-Euclidean foundation models increasingly place representations in curved
spaces such as hyperbolic geometry. We show that this geometry creates a
boundary-driven asymmetry that backdoor triggers can exploit. Near the
boundary, small input changes appear subtle to standard input-space detectors
but produce disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation
space. Our analysis formalizes this effect and also reveals a limitation for
defenses: methods that act by pulling points inward along the radius can
suppress such triggers, but only by sacrificing useful model sensitivity in
that same direction. Building on these insights, we propose a simple
geometry-adaptive trigger and evaluate it across tasks and architectures.
Empirically, attack success increases toward the boundary, whereas conventional
detectors weaken, mirroring the theoretical trends. Together, these results
surface a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models and offer
analysis-backed guidance for designing and understanding the limits of
defenses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了标签噪声对深度神经网络隐藏表示的影响，发现隐藏表示的信息内容随网络参数数量呈现双下降现象，类似于测试误差的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实世界数据集中，标签常因标注错误而存在噪声。虽然标签噪声对深度学习模型性能的影响已被广泛研究，但其对网络隐藏表示的影响仍知之甚少。

Method: 使用信息不平衡（Information Imbalance）这一计算效率高的条件互信息代理，系统比较隐藏表示。分析不同参数化程度下网络在干净标签和噪声标签下的表示学习。

Result: 在欠参数化状态下，噪声标签学习的表示比干净标签更信息丰富；在过参数化状态下，两者信息量相当。过参数化网络的表示对标签噪声具有鲁棒性。随机标签训练的表现比随机特征更差。

Conclusion: 过参数化网络的隐藏表示对标签噪声具有鲁棒性，且最后一层和softmax前层之间的信息不平衡随交叉熵损失减少，这为理解分类任务中的泛化提供了新视角。

Abstract: In supervised classification tasks, models are trained to predict a label for
each data point. In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to
annotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep
learning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden
representations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically
comparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a
computationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this
analysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations
follows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,
akin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the
underparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more
informative than those learned with clean labels, while in the
overparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our
results indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are
robust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the
penultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the
overparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding
generalization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to
representations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse
than random features. This indicates that training on random labels drives
networks much beyond lazy learning, as weights adapt to encode labels
information.

Method: 构建小型预训练模型组合，采用集成学习和模型选择策略，通过后训练基础模型创建多样化的专家模型。

Conclusion: 模型组合方法在时间序列预测中具有显著优势，能够以更少参数达到竞争性性能，为构建高效时序基础模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Is bigger always better for time series foundation models? With the question
in mind, we explore an alternative to training a single, large monolithic
model: building a portfolio of smaller, pretrained forecasting models. By
applying ensembling or model selection over these portfolios, we achieve
competitive performance on large-scale benchmarks using much fewer parameters.
We explore strategies for designing such portfolios and find that collections
of specialist models consistently outperform portfolios of independently
trained generalists. Remarkably, we demonstrate that post-training a base model
is a compute-effective approach for creating sufficiently diverse specialists,
and provide evidences that ensembling and model selection are more
compute-efficient than test-time fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Hellinger定位框架的新方法，用于多轨迹设置中的实例最优学习，显著扩展了现有方法的适用范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习中从时间相关数据学习是核心问题，但多轨迹设置下的序列学习理解仍不完整。现有方法要么只能应用于最小二乘回归，要么需要将多轨迹简化为i.i.d.学习或单轨迹混合假设，导致样本效率低下。

Method: 采用Hellinger定位框架，首先在路径测度级别通过简化为i.i.d.学习来控制平方Hellinger距离，然后在参数空间中以轨迹Fisher信息加权的二次形式进行定位。

Result: 该方法在四个不同案例研究中实现了实例最优边界：马尔可夫链混合、非高斯噪声下的依赖线性回归、非单调激活的广义线性模型以及线性注意力序列模型。在所有情况下，边界几乎匹配渐近正态性的实例最优率，显著优于标准简化方法。

Conclusion: Hellinger定位框架显著拓宽了多轨迹设置中实例最优率的适用范围，能够在广泛条件下实现与全数据预算成比例的样本效率提升。

Abstract: Learning from temporally-correlated data is a core facet of modern machine
learning. Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete,
particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many
independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important
regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation
models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing
assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal
bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates;
for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable
guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective
sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing
single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective
sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time.
  In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in
multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general
approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first
controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a
reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in
parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields
instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set
of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a
simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian
noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and
linear-attention sequence models. In all cases, our bounds nearly match the
instance-optimal rates from asymptotic normality, substantially improving over
standard reductions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的线性池化方法（从简单平均到动态权重更新）存在反应性限制，难以快速适应环境变化。需要一种能够预测模型性能的前瞻性方法。

Method: 在去中心化学习网络中增加性能预测工作器，使用机器学习模型预测每个模型在时间序列中的性能，基于预测结果分配权重。

Result: 预测后悔值或后悔z分数的模型比预测损失的模型表现更好，能够超越朴素网络推理（历史加权平均）。性能预测模型的性能对特征集和训练周期数选择敏感。

Conclusion: 性能预测方法可用于任何需要预测性而非反应性模型加权的场景，虽然最初为去中心化学习网络设计，但具有更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In decentralized learning networks, predictions from many participants are
combined to generate a network inference. While many studies have demonstrated
performance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing
strategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to
dynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations
that rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.
Due to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving
averages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing
circumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that
uses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at
each epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning
higher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We
show that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning
network, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the
accuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that
predict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret
z-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than
models predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network
inference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series
of optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model
can be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.
These properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each
domain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using
performance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any
situation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed.

Abstract: Transferability estimation metrics are used to find a high-performing
pre-trained model for a given target task without fine-tuning models and
without access to the source dataset. Despite the growing interest in
developing such metrics, the benchmarks used to measure their progress have
gone largely unexamined. In this work, we empirically show the shortcomings of
widely used benchmark setups to evaluate transferability estimation metrics. We
argue that the benchmarks on which these metrics are evaluated are
fundamentally flawed. We empirically demonstrate that their unrealistic model
spaces and static performance hierarchies artificially inflate the perceived
performance of existing metrics, to the point where simple, dataset-agnostic
heuristics can outperform sophisticated methods. Our analysis reveals a
critical disconnect between current evaluation protocols and the complexities
of real-world model selection. To address this, we provide concrete
recommendations for constructing more robust and realistic benchmarks to guide
future research in a more meaningful direction.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了注意力沉没点与压缩谷之间的关联，两者都源于残差流中的大规模激活。作者提出了Mix-Compress-Refine理论，解释LLM通过控制大规模激活来组织深度计算的过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究注意力沉没点和压缩谷这两个在大型语言模型中观察到的神秘现象之间的联系，探索它们共同的成因机制。

Method: 通过理论证明大规模激活必然导致表征压缩，并在多个模型（410M-120B参数）上进行实验验证，包括针对性消融研究。

Result: 实验证实当序列开始token在中间层产生极端激活范数时，压缩谷和注意力沉没点会同时出现，验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 提出了Mix-Compress-Refine信息流理论，认为Transformer-based LLM在三个不同阶段处理token：早期层广泛混合、中间层压缩计算、后期层选择性精炼，这解释了不同任务对层深度的依赖差异。

Abstract: Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention
as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in
isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention
sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive
activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive
activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish
bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several
models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence
token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression
valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies
validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose
the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain
how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and
representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit
that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad
mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in
the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our
framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate
layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying
differences in task-dependent representations.

TL;DR: Sequential-EDFL是一种用于语言模型生成停止的序列测试方法，通过跟踪信息提升（完整模型与弱化骨架基线的对数似然比）来实现任意时间有效的错误控制，减少22-28%的生成量，同时保持delta级错误控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决语言模型生成过程中何时停止的问题，同时确保任意停止时间下的正式错误控制，减少不必要的生成计算开销。

Method: 使用自归一化经验-伯努利e过程跟踪信息提升，处理未知中心化问题，通过混合e过程组合多个参数，支持分布漂移下的自适应重置，并引入自动化骨架（蒸馏子模型、随机化logits）。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，Sequential-EDFL相比序列基线减少22-28%的生成量，保持delta级控制，计算开销为12%。与轻量级正确性门控结合时，可提高端任务正确性。

Conclusion: EDFL作为第一阶段过滤器，可将验证负担减少83%，但不能作为安全关键领域的独立解决方案，因为10.9%的停止序列即使有门控仍不正确。

Abstract: We introduce Sequential-EDFL (Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift), applying
anytime-valid sequential testing to language model generation stopping. Our
approach tracks information lift -- the log-likelihood ratio between full
models and deliberately weakened "skeleton" baselines -- using self-normalized
empirical-Bernstein e-processes that provide formal delta-level error control
regardless of stopping time. We handle unknown centering through online mean
estimation, combine multiple parameters via mixture e-processes, and support
adaptive resets under distributional drift. On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL
reduces generation by 22-28% vs. sequential baselines while maintaining
delta-level control with 12% computational overhead. We introduce automated
skeletons (distilled submodels, randomized logits) and show robustness across
skeleton families. Composing EDFL with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence
boundaries + verifier) improves end-task correctness while preserving
anytime-valid guarantees by only delaying stopping. Our certificates control
information sufficiency, not factual correctness -- 10.9% of stopped sequences
remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2-22.7% without it). EDFL serves as a
first-stage filter reducing verification burden by 83%, not as a standalone
solution for safety-critical domains.

Conclusion: GUIDE单独应用比知识蒸馏效果更好，且不引入任何训练或推理开销，质量提升几乎是免费的。

Abstract: Algorithmic efficiency techniques such as distillation
(\cite{hinton2015distillation}) are useful in improving model quality without
increasing serving costs, provided a larger teacher model is available for a
smaller student model to learn from during training. Standard distillation
methods are limited to only forcing the student to match the teacher's outputs.
Given the costs associated with training a large model, we believe we should be
extracting more useful information from a teacher model than by just making the
student match the teacher's outputs.
  In this paper, we introduce \guide (Guided Initialization and Distillation of
Embeddings). \guide can be considered a distillation technique that forces the
student to match the teacher in the parameter space. Using \guide we show
25-26\% reduction in the teacher-student quality gap when using large student
models (400M - 1B parameters) trained on $\approx$ 20B tokens. We also present
a thorough analysis demonstrating that \guide can be combined with knowledge
distillation with near additive improvements. Furthermore, we show that
applying \guide alone leads to substantially better model quality than applying
knowledge distillation by itself.
  Most importantly, \guide introduces no training or inference overhead and
hence any model quality gains from our method are virtually free.

Abstract: Accurate time-series predictions in machine learning are heavily influenced
by the selection of appropriate input time length and sampling rate. This paper
introduces ATLO-ML, an adaptive time-length optimization system that
automatically determines the optimal input time length and sampling rate based
on user-defined output time length. The system provides a flexible approach to
time-series data pre-processing, dynamically adjusting these parameters to
enhance predictive performance. ATLO-ML is validated using air quality

for generalization across various time-sensitive applications, offering a
robust solution for optimizing temporal input parameters in machine learning

Abstract: Generative AI leaderboards are central to evaluating model capabilities, but
remain vulnerable to manipulation. Among key adversarial objectives is rank
manipulation, where an attacker must first deanonymize the models behind
displayed outputs -- a threat previously demonstrated and explored for large
language models (LLMs). We show that this problem can be even more severe for
text-to-image leaderboards, where deanonymization is markedly easier. Using
over 150,000 generated images from 280 prompts and 19 diverse models spanning
multiple organizations, architectures, and sizes, we demonstrate that simple
real-time classification in CLIP embedding space identifies the generating
model with high accuracy, even without prompt control or historical data. We
further introduce a prompt-level separability metric and identify prompts that
enable near-perfect deanonymization. Our results indicate that rank
manipulation in text-to-image leaderboards is easier than previously
recognized, underscoring the need for stronger defenses.

Abstract: We establish that randomly initialized neural networks, with large width and
a natural choice of hyperparameters, have nearly independent outputs exactly
when their activation function is nonlinear with zero mean under the Gaussian
measure: $\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[\sigma(z)]=0$. For example, this
includes ReLU and GeLU with an additive shift, as well as tanh, but not ReLU or
GeLU by themselves. Because of their nearly independent outputs, we propose
neural networks with zero-mean activation functions as a promising candidate

Motivation: POMDP中信念状态的连续性给学习最优策略带来了显著的计算挑战，需要找到有效的近似方法来处理这种复杂性。

Abstract: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant
computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we
consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning
(PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a
finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first
derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the
optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value
function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning
approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the
Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be
approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by
treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We
show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of
this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the
first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD
learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.

TL;DR: 该论文从数学角度研究了强化学习中目标条件化自回归模型产生的策略不连贯性问题，证明了在线RL微调离线学习策略可以减少不连贯性并提高回报，建立了训练-推断权衡的三重对应关系。

Motivation: 研究强化学习策略中由朴素目标条件化自回归模型引起的不连贯性结构问题，特别是分析通过在线RL重新训练离线学习策略的过程。

Method: 通过重新构建控制即推断和软Q学习的标准概念，建立了三重对应关系：将后验折叠到奖励中，在确定性情况下降低温度参数，并通过软条件生成模型分析不连贯性与有效视野的联系。

Result: 证明了在线RL微调离线学习策略可以减少策略不连贯性并提高回报，建立了训练-推断权衡的计算内容对应关系。

Conclusion: 迭代重新训练过程可以通过多重角度理解，不连贯性与有效视野之间存在联系，这为改进强化学习策略提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We investigate mathematically the notion of incoherence: a structural issue
with reinforcement learning policies derived by naive goal-conditioning of
autoregressive models. We focus on the process of re-training models on their
own actions, that is, fine-tuning offline-learned policies with online RL. We
prove that it decreases incoherence and leads to an improvement in return, and
we aim to characterize the resulting trajectory of policies. By re-framing
standard notions of control-as-inference and soft Q learning, we establish a
three-way correspondence with two other ways of understanding the iterative
re-training process: as folding the posterior into the reward and, in the
deterministic case, as decreasing the temperature parameter; the correspondence
has computational content via the training-inference trade-off. Through
soft-conditioning generative models, we discuss the link between incoherence
and the effective horizon.

TL;DR: 提出了Markovian Thinking范式，将推理过程分解为固定大小的块，实现线性计算复杂度和常数内存使用，显著提升长推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL推理环境中状态随推理长度增长而无限扩大，导致注意力机制需要二次计算复杂度，限制了长推理链的可扩展性

Method: 设计Delethink RL环境，将推理结构化到固定大小的块中，在每个块边界重置上下文并用简短摘要重新初始化提示，通过RL学习在块结束时写入足够的文本状态以实现无缝推理延续

Result: 1.5B模型在8K token块中推理但总思考长度可达24K token，性能匹配或超过使用24K预算的LongCoT-RL，在96K平均思考长度下成本从27 H100月降至7 H100月

Conclusion: 重新设计思考环境是实现高效可扩展推理LLMs的强大杠杆，能够在没有二次开销的情况下实现超长推理

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training
reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard
RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior
reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies
to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment
itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances
reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking
length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear
compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL
environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each
chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the
context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the
policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient
for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this
environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up
to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget.
With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus.
The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K
average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink.
Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B)
often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing
positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that
redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long
reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient,
scalable reasoning LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较了两种AI框架与纯人工评估在医学影像疾病评估中的表现，发现AI作为辅助阅片者(AI-SR)是最适合临床试验的方法，即使在模型性能较差时也能保持可靠性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在临床试验中具有巨大潜力，但无保障措施地部署AI存在显著风险，特别是在评估直接影响试验结论的患者终点指标时。

Method: 比较两种AI框架与纯人工评估，测量成本、准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。通过注入从随机猜测到简单预测的劣质模型来压力测试框架，确保在严重模型退化情况下仍能保持有效的治疗效果评估。使用两个基于脊柱X光图像的随机对照试验进行评估。

Result: AI作为辅助阅片者(AI-SR)方法在所有标准上表现最佳，能够提供可靠的疾病估计，保持临床试验治疗效果估计和结论的有效性，并在应用于不同人群时保持这些优势。

Conclusion: AI-SR是临床试验中最合适的方法，即使在模型性能较差的情况下也能确保试验结论的可靠性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for supporting clinical
trials, from patient recruitment and endpoint assessment to treatment response
prediction. However, deploying AI without safeguards poses significant risks,
particularly when evaluating patient endpoints that directly impact trial
conclusions. We compared two AI frameworks against human-only assessment for
medical image-based disease evaluation, measuring cost, accuracy, robustness,
and generalization ability. To stress-test these frameworks, we injected bad
models, ranging from random guesses to naive predictions, to ensure that
observed treatment effects remain valid even under severe model degradation. We
evaluated the frameworks using two randomized controlled trials with endpoints
derived from spinal X-ray images. Our findings indicate that using AI as a
supporting reader (AI-SR) is the most suitable approach for clinical trials, as
it meets all criteria across various model types, even with bad models. This
method consistently provides reliable disease estimation, preserves clinical
trial treatment effect estimates and conclusions, and retains these advantages
when applied to different populations.

TL;DR: 提出DPA-Net双路径注意力神经网络，从稀疏的SMBG数据直接估计AGP血糖指标，解决CGM成本高、可及性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CGM设备成本高、可及性差，限制了在低收入地区的广泛应用；而SMBG虽然便宜易得，但数据稀疏难以生成有临床意义的血糖指标。

Method: 使用双路径注意力神经网络：空间通道注意力路径重建CGM轨迹，多尺度ResNet路径直接预测AGP指标，并引入对齐机制减少偏差。

Result: 在大型真实数据集上验证，DPA-Net实现了稳健的准确性和低误差，同时减少了系统偏差。

Conclusion: 这是首个从SMBG数据估计AGP指标的监督机器学习框架，为无法使用CGM的场景提供了实用的临床决策支持工具。

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides dense and dynamic glucose
profiles that enable reliable estimation of Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP)
metrics, such as Time in Range (TIR), Time Below Range (TBR), and Time Above
Range (TAR). However, the high cost and limited accessibility of CGM restrict
its widespread adoption, particularly in low- and middle-income regions. In
contrast, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is inexpensive and widely
available but yields sparse and irregular data that are challenging to
translate into clinically meaningful glycemic metrics.
  In this work, we propose a Dual-Path Attention Neural Network (DPA-Net) to
estimate AGP metrics directly from SMBG data. DPA-Net integrates two
complementary paths: (1) a spatial-channel attention path that reconstructs a
CGM-like trajectory from sparse SMBG observations, and (2) a multi-scale ResNet
path that directly predicts AGP metrics. An alignment mechanism between the two
paths is introduced to reduce bias and mitigate overfitting. In addition, we
develop an active point selector to identify realistic and informative SMBG
sampling points that reflect patient behavioral patterns.
  Experimental results on a large, real-world dataset demonstrate that DPA-Net
achieves robust accuracy with low errors while reducing systematic bias. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first supervised machine learning framework
for estimating AGP metrics from SMBG data, offering a practical and clinically
relevant decision-support tool in settings where CGM is not accessible.

TL;DR: POME是一种后优化模型编辑算法，通过应用muon-style投影到微调权重与预训练权重的差异ΔW上，使用截断SVD来均衡主导更新方向的影响并修剪小奇异值，从而提升微调后大语言模型的性能，无需额外数据或进一步优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的微调方法往往在性能提升上存在瓶颈，且微调后的模型权重可能包含噪声或某些更新方向过度主导，导致性能未达最优。POME旨在通过简单的后处理步骤解决这一问题，实现零成本的性能提升。

Method: POME算法核心是对权重差异ΔW应用muon-style投影，使用截断奇异值分解(SVD)来均衡主导更新方向的影响，并修剪代表噪声的小奇异值。该过程完全解耦于训练流程，无需修改训练过程或引入额外开销。

Result: POME在多个任务上带来一致性能提升：GSM8K任务平均性能提升+2.5%，代码生成任务提升+1.0%。该算法适用于从7B基础模型到72B RLHF指导模型的各种规模模型。

Conclusion: POME作为一种实用、零成本的增强方法，可广泛应用于任何微调流程，通过简单的后处理步骤显著提升模型性能，且与优化器和分布式框架完全兼容。

Abstract: We introduce Post-Optimization Model Edit (POME), a new algorithm that
enhances the performance of fine-tuned large language models using only their
pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints, without requiring extra data or further
optimization. The core idea is to apply a muon-style projection to $\Delta W$,
the difference between the fine-tuned and pretrained weights. This projection
uses truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) to equalize the influence of
dominant update directions and prune small singular values, which often
represent noise. As a simple post-processing step, POME is completely decoupled
from the training pipeline. It requires zero modifications and imposes no
overhead, making it universally compatible with any optimizer or distributed
framework. POME delivers consistent gains, boosting average performance by
+2.5\% on GSM8K and +1.0\% on code generation. Its broad applicability -- from
7B foundation models to 72B RLHF-instructed models -- establishes it as a
practical, zero-cost enhancement for any fine-tuning pipeline. Code is
available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/POME.

Motivation: 地下水和污水管道对城市运行至关重要，但存在泄漏和渗透等异常问题，导致大量水资源损失、环境破坏和高昂维修成本。传统人工检查效率低下，密集传感器部署成本过高。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从有限的传感器部署中实现准确的网络范围预测，可有效扩展到各种地下水管网络。

Abstract: Underground water and wastewater pipelines are vital for city operations but
plagued by anomalies like leaks and infiltrations, causing substantial water
loss, environmental damage, and high repair costs. Conventional manual
inspections lack efficiency, while dense sensor deployments are prohibitively
expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly and is
increasingly applied to urban infrastructure. In this research, we propose an
integrated AI and remote-sensor framework to address the challenge of leak
detection in underground water pipelines, through deploying a sparse set of
remote sensors to capture real-time flow and depth data, paired with HydroNet -
a dedicated model utilizing pipeline attributes (e.g., material, diameter,
slope) in a directed graph for higher-precision modeling. Evaluations on a
real-world campus wastewater network dataset demonstrate that our system
collects effective spatio-temporal hydraulic data, enabling HydroNet to
outperform advanced baselines. This integration of edge-aware message passing
with hydraulic simulations enables accurate network-wide predictions from
limited sensor deployments. We envision that this approach can be effectively
extended to a wide range of underground water pipeline networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然α-散度在NMF中提供了优化的灵活性，但将其扩展到多层架构时难以确保收敛性，需要新的理论分析方法。

Method: 受化学反应中能量势垒的玻尔兹曼概率启发，提出了Chem-NMF方法，引入边界因子来稳定收敛，首次从物理化学视角严格分析NMF算法的收敛行为。

Result: 实验结果表明，在生物医学信号上聚类准确率提升5.6%±2.7%，在面部图像上提升11.1%±7.2%。

Conclusion: 这是首个从物理化学视角严格分析NMF收敛行为的研究，提出的Chem-NMF方法有效提升了多层NMF的收敛稳定性和聚类性能。

Abstract: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning method
offering low-rank representations across various domains such as audio
processing, biomedical signal analysis, and image recognition. The
incorporation of $\alpha$-divergence in NMF formulations enhances flexibility
in optimization, yet extending these methods to multi-layer architectures
presents challenges in ensuring convergence. To address this, we introduce a
novel approach inspired by the Boltzmann probability of the energy barriers in
chemical reactions to theoretically perform convergence analysis. We introduce
a novel method, called Chem-NMF, with a bounding factor which stabilizes
convergence. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a physical
chemistry perspective to rigorously analyze the convergence behaviour of the
NMF algorithm. We start from mathematically proven asymptotic convergence
results and then show how they apply to real data. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves clustering accuracy by 5.6%
$\pm$ 2.7% on biomedical signals and 11.1% $\pm$ 7.2% on face images (mean
$\pm$ std).

Motivation: 建模任意数据分布之间的转换是科学应用中的基本挑战，但现有流匹配方法主要关注噪声到数据的设置，在分布到分布转换场景中应用不足，且标准方法在源分布也是从有限样本学习时因监督稀疏而失败。

Method: 提出简单高效的方法，通过对源样本和流插值注入随机性来增强训练过程，解决监督稀疏问题。

Conclusion: 该方法使流匹配成为模拟科学中出现的多样化分布转换的更实用工具，能更好地突出转换的真实效果。

Abstract: Modeling transformations between arbitrary data distributions is a
fundamental scientific challenge, arising in applications like drug discovery
and evolutionary simulation. While flow matching offers a natural framework for
this task, its use has thus far primarily focused on the noise-to-data setting,
while its application in the general distribution-to-distribution setting is
underexplored. We find that in the latter case, where the source is also a data
distribution to be learned from limited samples, standard flow matching fails
due to sparse supervision. To address this, we propose a simple and
computationally efficient method that injects stochasticity into the training
process by perturbing source samples and flow interpolants. On five diverse
imaging tasks spanning biology, radiology, and astronomy, our method
significantly improves generation quality, outperforming existing baselines by
an average of 9 FID points. Our approach also reduces the transport cost
between input and generated samples to better highlight the true effect of the
transformation, making flow matching a more practical tool for simulating the
diverse distribution transformations that arise in science.

Motivation: 传统符号回归方法缺乏从时间序列观测中提取结构化物理先验的机制，难以捕获反映系统全局行为的符号表达式。

Method: 使用PINN进行局部泰勒展开获取导数结构信息，引入基于掩码的归因机制量化子树贡献，通过混合适应度函数联合最小化物理残差和泰勒系数失配。

Result: 在基准PDE系统实验中，StruSR相比传统基线方法提高了收敛速度、结构保真度和表达式可解释性。

Conclusion: StruSR为基于物理的符号发现提供了一个有原则的范式，能够有效提取物理先验并指导符号表达式演化。

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by
searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system
behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws.
However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical
priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic
expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose
a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages
trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured
physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on
the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural
information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of
expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that
quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical
residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover
operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high
physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less
informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics
residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the
governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN.
Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves
convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability
compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for
physics-grounded symbolic discovery.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion
models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains
underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained
ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing
future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming
observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the
context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial
differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often
computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse
observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout
with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or
optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and
physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We
will release code and checkpoints publicly.

TL;DR: 本文评估了机器学习算子(MLOs)在零样本超分辨率任务中的表现，发现MLOs无法在未经额外训练的情况下处理不同分辨率的数据，存在混叠问题。作者提出了一个简单的多分辨率训练方案来解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习中的一个核心挑战是如何建模连续现象，这些现象在实践中通常以离散形式表示。MLOs被引入作为实现这一目标的手段，但需要评估其是否能够实现零样本超分辨率推理。

Method: 将多分辨率推理解耦为两个关键行为：1)对不同频率信息的推断；2)在不同分辨率间的插值。通过实证研究发现MLOs在这两个任务上都失败，然后提出了一个计算效率高、数据驱动的多分辨率训练方案。

Result: 实证研究表明MLOs无法在零样本方式下执行准确的多分辨率推理，它们对训练分辨率之外的推理很脆弱，容易受到混叠影响。提出的多分辨率训练方案能够克服混叠问题并提供稳健的多分辨率泛化能力。

Conclusion: MLOs本身无法实现零样本超分辨率，但通过提出的多分辨率训练协议可以解决混叠问题并实现稳健的多分辨率泛化。

Abstract: A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing
more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are
represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced
as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can
perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether
this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot
super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on
higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We
comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution
(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution
inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency
information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically
demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.
Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at
resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they
are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we
propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution
training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust
multi-resolution generalization.

Conclusion: ARQ方法简单且具有生物学基础，在强化学习中表现出色，为无反向传播学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm is a recently proposed learning procedure
for neural networks that employs two forward passes instead of the traditional
forward and backward passes used in backpropagation. However, FF remains
largely confined to supervised settings, leaving a gap at domains where
learning signals can be yielded more naturally such as RL. In this work,
inspired by FF's goodness function using layer activity statistics, we
introduce Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ), a novel value
estimation method that applies a goodness function and action conditioning for
local RL using temporal difference learning. Despite its simplicity and
biological grounding, our approach achieves superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art local backprop-free RL methods in the MinAtar and the DeepMind

Conclusion: GMNM是一个强大灵活的非线性模块，能够有效提升各种机器学习应用的效率和准确性

Abstract: Neural networks in general, from MLPs and CNNs to attention-based
Transformers, are constructed from layers of linear combinations followed by
nonlinear operations such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Softmax. Despite their strength,
these conventional designs are often limited in introducing non-linearity by
the choice of activation functions. In this work, we introduce Gaussian
Mixture-Inspired Nonlinear Modules (GMNM), a new class of differentiable
modules that draw on the universal density approximation Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) and distance properties (metric space) of Gaussian kernal. By
relaxing probabilistic constraints and adopting a flexible parameterization of
Gaussian projections, GMNM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse neural
architectures and trained end-to-end with gradient-based methods. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating GMNM into architectures such as
MLPs, CNNs, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs consistently improves performance
over standard baselines. These results highlight GMNM's potential as a powerful
and flexible module for enhancing efficiency and accuracy across a wide range
of machine learning applications.

Abstract: Transformer has become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, yet a
detailed understanding of how its structural parameters influence expressive
power remains limited. In this work, we study the approximation properties of
transformers, with particular emphasis on the role of the number of attention
heads. Our analysis begins with the introduction of a generalized $D$-retrieval
task, which we prove to be dense in the space of continuous functions, thereby
providing the basis for our theoretical framework. We then establish both upper
and lower bounds on the parameter complexity required for
$\epsilon$-approximation. Specifically, we show that transformers with
sufficiently many heads admit efficient approximation, whereas with too few
heads, the number of parameters must scale at least as $O(1/\epsilon^{cT})$,
for some constant $c$ and sequence length $T$. To the best of our knowledge,
this constitutes the first rigorous lower bound of this type in a nonlinear and
practically relevant setting. We further examine the single-head case and
demonstrate that an embedding dimension of order $O(T)$ allows complete
memorization of the input, where approximation is entirely achieved by the
feed-forward block. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with
experiments on both synthetic data and real-world tasks, illustrating the
practical relevance of our results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XRPO是一个强化学习框架，通过探索-利用的视角重新构建策略优化，在GRPO基础上改进探索和利用机制，在数学和编程基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO等强化学习方法在LLM推理中存在探索不足和反馈信号利用不充分的问题，主要由于跨提示的上下文无关rollout分配和过度依赖稀疏奖励。

Method: XRPO引入数学基础的rollout分配器自适应优先处理不确定性减少潜力大的提示；使用上下文种子策略注入精选示例；开发基于序列似然性的组相对、新颖性感知优势锐化机制。

Result: 在多样化的数学和编程基准测试中，XRPO比现有方法（如GRPO和GSPO）在pass@1上提升达4%，在cons@32上提升达6%，训练收敛速度加快达2.7倍。

Conclusion: XRPO通过探索-利用的统一框架有效解决了LLM推理中的探索不足和稀疏奖励问题，显著提升了强化学习在语言模型推理中的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO have driven recent advances in
large language model (LLM) reasoning. While scaling the number of rollouts
stabilizes training, existing approaches suffer from limited exploration on
challenging prompts and leave informative feedback signals underexploited, due
to context-independent rollout allocation across prompts (e.g., generating 16
rollouts per prompt) and relying heavily on sparse rewards. This paper presents
XRPO(eXplore - eXploit GRPO), a unified framework that recasts policy
optimization through the principled lens of rollout exploration-exploitation.
To enhance exploration, XRPO introduces a mathematically grounded rollout
allocator that adaptively prioritizes prompts with higher potential for
uncertainty reduction. It further addresses stagnation on zero-reward prompts
through an in-context seeding strategy that injects curated exemplars, steering
the model into more difficult reasoning trajectories. To strengthen
exploitation, XRPO develops a group-relative, novelty-aware advantage
sharpening mechanism that leverages sequence likelihoods to amplify
low-probability yet correct responses, thereby extending the policy's reach
beyond sparse rewards. Experiments across diverse math and coding benchmarks on
both reasoning and non-reasoning models demonstrate that XRPO outperforms
existing advances (e.g., GRPO and GSPO) up to 4% pass@1 and 6% cons@32, while
accelerating training convergence by up to 2.7X.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TimeFormer，一种针对时间序列数据设计的Transformer架构，通过改进的自注意力机制和时序先验来提升时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer在时间序列预测中表现不佳，主要因为未能充分考虑文本数据与时间序列数据的模态差异，特别是时间序列的单向性和影响力衰减特性。

Method: 提出TimeFormer，核心创新是带有两个调制项的自注意力机制(MoSA)，基于Hawkes过程和因果掩码捕获时间序列的时序先验；同时引入多尺度和子序列分析框架来捕获不同时间尺度的语义依赖。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，TimeFormer显著优于现有最优方法，在MSE上相比最佳基线降低7.45%，在94.04%的评估指标上创造了新记录。

Conclusion: TimeFormer通过有效整合时间序列的时序特性，显著提升了Transformer在时间序列预测中的性能，且MoSA机制可广泛应用于其他基于Transformer的模型。

Abstract: Although Transformers excel in natural language processing, their extension
to time series forecasting remains challenging due to insufficient
consideration of the differences between textual and temporal modalities. In
this paper, we develop a novel Transformer architecture designed for time
series data, aiming to maximize its representational capacity. We identify two
key but often overlooked characteristics of time series: (1) unidirectional
influence from the past to the future, and (2) the phenomenon of decaying
influence over time. These characteristics are introduced to enhance the
attention mechanism of Transformers. We propose TimeFormer, whose core
innovation is a self-attention mechanism with two modulation terms (MoSA),
designed to capture these temporal priors of time series under the constraints
of the Hawkes process and causal masking. Additionally, TimeFormer introduces a
framework based on multi-scale and subsequence analysis to capture semantic
dependencies at different temporal scales, enriching the temporal dependencies.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets show that
TimeFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to
a 7.45% reduction in MSE compared to the best baseline and setting new
benchmarks on 94.04\% of evaluation metrics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
MoSA mechanism can be broadly applied to enhance the performance of other
Transformer-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多玩家多臂老虎机问题中的分布式协调挑战，避免玩家选择同一臂导致的碰撞，在无中心协调的情况下最大化累积奖励。

Method: 设计分布式算法，采用自适应高效通信协议，玩家仅能观察自身动作和碰撞反馈，通过有限通信实现协调。

Result: 算法实现了近最优的群体和个人遗憾，通信成本仅为O(log log T)，实验显示相比现有方法显著降低了个人遗憾。

Conclusion: 提出的分布式算法在通信效率和性能上都优于现有方法，并成功扩展到异步设置，实现了对数遗憾。

Abstract: We study the stochastic Multiplayer Multi-Armed Bandit (MMAB) problem, where
multiple players select arms to maximize their cumulative rewards. Collisions
occur when two or more players select the same arm, resulting in no reward, and
are observed by the players involved. We consider a distributed setting without
central coordination, where each player can only observe their own actions and
collision feedback. We propose a distributed algorithm with an adaptive,
efficient communication protocol. The algorithm achieves near-optimal group and
individual regret, with a communication cost of only $\mathcal{O}(\log\log T)$.
Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing
baselines. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach achieves a
notable reduction in individual regret. Finally, we extend our approach to a
periodic asynchronous setting, proving the lower bound for this problem and
presenting an algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret.

Motivation: 现有基于硬标签的模型提取攻击在深层网络中需要指数级查询量，实际不可行。本文旨在解决这一关键限制，使模型提取在深层网络中仍保持多项式时间复杂度。

Method: 提出CrossLayer Extraction方法，不直接提取特定神经元的秘密参数，而是利用跨层神经元交互从更深层提取信息，从而避免指数级成本。

Conclusion: 跨层提取技术为深层神经网络的安全分析提供了更实用的攻击方法，揭示了现有安全假设的不足，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have attracted significant attention, and their
internal models are now considered valuable intellectual assets. Extracting
these internal models through access to a DNN is conceptually similar to
extracting a secret key via oracle access to a block cipher. Consequently,
cryptanalytic techniques, particularly differential-like attacks, have been
actively explored recently. ReLU-based DNNs are the most commonly and widely
deployed architectures. While early works (e.g., Crypto 2020, Eurocrypt 2024)
assume access to exact output logits, which are usually invisible, more recent
works (e.g., Asiacrypt 2024, Eurocrypt 2025) focus on the hard-label setting,
where only the final classification result (e.g., "dog" or "car") is available
to the attacker. Notably, Carlini et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) demonstrated that
model extraction is feasible in polynomial time even under this restricted
setting.
  In this paper, we first show that the assumptions underlying their attack
become increasingly unrealistic as the attack-target depth grows. In practice,
satisfying these assumptions requires an exponential number of queries with
respect to the attack depth, implying that the attack does not always run in
polynomial time. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel attack
method called CrossLayer Extraction. Instead of directly extracting the secret
parameters (e.g., weights and biases) of a specific neuron, which incurs
exponential cost, we exploit neuron interactions across layers to extract this
information from deeper layers. This technique significantly reduces query
complexity and mitigates the limitations of existing model extraction
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成真实时间序列数据在医疗、金融和科学领域至关重要，但不规则采样和缺失值带来重大挑战。现有方法处理这些不规则性时效果不佳且计算成本高。

Method: 首先使用时间序列变换器补全不规则序列，创建自然邻域；然后使用带掩码的视觉扩散模型，最小化对补全值的依赖。

Result: 实现了最先进的性能，判别分数相对提升70%，计算成本相对降低85%。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了补全和掩码的优势，能够稳健高效地生成真实时间序列数据。

Abstract: Generating realistic time series data is critical for applications in
healthcare, finance, and science. However, irregular sampling and missing
values present significant challenges. While prior methods address these
irregularities, they often yield suboptimal results and incur high
computational costs. Recent advances in regular time series generation, such as
the diffusion-based ImagenTime model, demonstrate strong, fast, and scalable
generative capabilities by transforming time series into image representations,
making them a promising solution. However, extending ImagenTime to irregular
sequences using simple masking introduces "unnatural" neighborhoods, where
missing values replaced by zeros disrupt the learning process. To overcome
this, we propose a novel two-step framework: first, a Time Series Transformer
completes irregular sequences, creating natural neighborhoods; second, a
vision-based diffusion model with masking minimizes dependence on the completed
values. This approach leverages the strengths of both completion and masking,
enabling robust and efficient generation of realistic time series. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving a relative improvement in
discriminative score by $70\%$ and in computational cost by $85\%$. Code is at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标条件强化学习中的状态表示可能包含外生噪声且依赖于原始状态表示，需要一种更鲁棒和通用的目标表示方法。

Method: 开发双目标表示学习框架，通过计算状态与所有其他状态间的时序距离来构建表示，该方法可与现有GCRL算法结合使用。

Result: 在OGBench任务套件的20个状态和像素任务上，双目标表示方法一致提升了离线目标达成性能。

Conclusion: 双目标表示提供了一种理论上有保证且实用的目标表示方法，能够有效提升目标条件强化学习的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce dual goal representations for goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning (GCRL). A dual goal representation characterizes a state
by "the set of temporal distances from all other states"; in other words, it
encodes a state through its relations to every other state, measured by
temporal distance. This representation provides several appealing theoretical
properties. First, it depends only on the intrinsic dynamics of the environment
and is invariant to the original state representation. Second, it contains
provably sufficient information to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy,
while being able to filter out exogenous noise. Based on this concept, we
develop a practical goal representation learning method that can be combined
with any existing GCRL algorithm. Through diverse experiments on the OGBench
task suite, we empirically show that dual goal representations consistently
improve offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based
tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效处理异质领域的因果发现问题，结合专家反馈，提高了因果结构学习的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Bayesian causal discovery benefits from prior information elicited from
domain experts, and in heterogeneous domains any prior knowledge would be badly
needed. However, so far prior elicitation approaches have assumed a single
causal graph and hence are not suited to heterogeneous domains. We propose a
causal elicitation strategy for heterogeneous settings, based on Bayesian
experimental design (BED) principles, and a variational mixture structure
learning (VaMSL) method -- extending the earlier differentiable Bayesian
structure learning (DiBS) method -- to iteratively infer mixtures of causal
Bayesian networks (CBNs). We construct an informative graph prior incorporating
elicited expert feedback in the inference of mixtures of CBNs. Our proposed
method successfully produces a set of alternative causal models (mixture
components or clusters), and achieves an improved structure learning
performance on heterogeneous synthetic data when informed by a simulated
expert. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is capable of capturing
complex distributions in a breast cancer database.

Abstract: Function regression/approximation is a fundamental application of machine
learning. Neural networks (NNs) can be easily trained for function regression
using a sufficient number of neurons and epochs. The forward-forward learning
algorithm is a novel approach for training neural networks without
backpropagation, and is well suited for implementation in neuromorphic
computing and physical analogs for neural networks. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, the Forward Forward paradigm of training and inferencing NNs is
currently only restricted to classification tasks. This paper introduces a new
methodology for approximating functions (function regression) using the
Forward-Forward algorithm. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the developed
methodology on univariate and multivariate functions, and provides preliminary
studies of extending the proposed Forward-Forward regression to Kolmogorov
Arnold Networks, and Deep Physical Neural Networks.

Conclusion: 证明了PINNs在局部化、长期流行病学建模中的实用性。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for quantitative modeling and
analysis to understand real-world disease dynamics. In particular, post hoc
analyses using compartmental models offer valuable insights into the
effectiveness of public health interventions, such as vaccination strategies
and containment policies. However, such compartmental models like SIR
(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) often face limitations in directly
incorporating noisy observational data. In this work, we employ
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the inverse problem of the
SIR model using infection data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Our main
contribution is a fine-grained, spatio-temporal analysis of COVID-19 dynamics
across all German federal states over a three-year period. We estimate
state-specific transmission and recovery parameters and time-varying
reproduction number (R_t) to track the pandemic progression. The results
highlight strong variations in transmission behavior across regions, revealing
correlations with vaccination uptake and temporal patterns associated with
major pandemic phases. Our findings demonstrate the utility of PINNs in
localized, long-term epidemiological modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出RICH假设：推理计算防御的效益取决于模型训练数据是否更好地反映被攻击数据的组成成分。通过组合泛化，即使面对对抗性OOD数据，模型也能遵循防御规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明LLM推理能提高对防御规范的遵循，但在攻击者获得梯度或多模态输入时，这种测试计算效益会减弱。本文旨在填补这一空白，证明推理计算在这些情况下仍能提供益处。

Method: 提出RICH假设，通过组合泛化机制使OOD数据可通过其ID组件理解。在视觉语言模型和多种攻击类型上进行实证验证，分析推理计算防御与基础模型鲁棒性的相关性。

Result: 研究发现，如果组合泛化能够解锁对OOD数据的规范遵循，测试时计算就能带来鲁棒性增益。通过提示增强防御规范强调，可降低基于梯度的多模态攻击成功率，但仅对经过对抗预训练的鲁棒模型有效。

Conclusion: 推理计算的鲁棒性效益与基础模型鲁棒性相关，形成富者愈富的动态。建议将训练时和测试时防御层叠使用，以获得协同效益。

Abstract: Models are susceptible to adversarially out-of-distribution (OOD) data
despite large training-compute investments into their robustification. Zaremba
et al. (2025) make progress on this problem at test time, showing LLM reasoning
improves satisfaction of model specifications designed to thwart attacks,
resulting in a correlation between reasoning effort and robustness to
jailbreaks. However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are
given access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying
that inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues
that compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via
its in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive
specifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness
from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as
the model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We
empirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack
types, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification
following on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL
finetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing
emphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of
gradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial
pretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to
not-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness
benefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH:
attacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding
compositional generalization to OOD data. Accordingly, we advise layering
train-time and test-time defenses to obtain their synergistic benefit.

Conclusion: 在在线持续图学习中，通过架构简化和稳定性可以最小化灾难性遗忘，无需复杂的重放或正则化机制。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the main obstacles for Online Continual
Graph Learning (OCGL), where nodes arrive one by one, distribution drifts may
occur at any time and offline training on task-specific subgraphs is not
feasible. In this work, we explore a surprisingly simple yet highly effective
approach for OCGL: we use a fixed, randomly initialized encoder to generate
robust and expressive node embeddings by aggregating neighborhood information,
training online only a lightweight classifier. By freezing the encoder, we
eliminate drifts of the representation parameters, a key source of forgetting,
obtaining embeddings that are both expressive and stable. When evaluated across
several OCGL benchmarks, despite its simplicity and lack of memory buffer, this
approach yields consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods, with surprising
improvements of up to 30% and performance often approaching that of the joint
offline-training upper bound. These results suggest that in OCGL, catastrophic
forgetting can be minimized without complex replay or regularization by
embracing architectural simplicity and stability.

Conclusion: BitTokens通过提高token效率，扩展了语言模型可解决问题的长度和复杂度，为科学和工程应用提供了更好的数值处理能力。

Abstract: To drive progress in science and engineering, large language models (LLMs)
must be able to process large amounts of numerical data and solve long
calculations efficiently. This is currently only possible through the use of
external tools or extensive reasoning chains, either limiting the numerical
intuition of LLMs or limiting the length of problems they can solve. We show
that frontier LLMs require excessive amounts of reasoning tokens to solve even
basic calculations, which is exacerbated by their tokenization strategies that
split single numbers into multiple tokens. This motivates the need for
efficient and effective single-token number encodings. We introduce a set of
desiderata for such encodings and show that existing approaches fail to fulfill
them. To address these shortcomings, we propose BitTokens, a novel tokenization
strategy that embeds any number into a single token using its IEEE 754 binary
floating-point representation. Through extensive experiments we show that our
BitTokens allow even small language models to learn algorithms that solve basic
arithmetic operations nearly perfectly. This newly gained efficiency could
expand the length and complexity of problems language models can solve.

Motivation: 挑战当前大语言模型中仅依赖注意力机制的趋势，指出完全并行化的架构无法表示长期智能体任务中某些重要问题类别，特别是在超越临界时间点后无法正确聚合输入。

Method: 引入具有循环完整性的架构，在GitHub行为序列上进行训练，使用固定参数数量但增加训练序列长度。

Conclusion: 循环机制对于长期智能体任务至关重要，仅靠注意力机制不足以处理超越临界时间点的输入聚合问题，提出的循环完整架构在时间效率上表现优越。

Abstract: In recent years, attention-like mechanisms have been used to great success in
the space of large language models, unlocking scaling potential to a previously
unthinkable extent. "Attention Is All You Need" famously claims RNN cells are
not needed in conjunction with attention. We challenge this view. In this
paper, we point to existing proofs that architectures with fully parallelizable
forward or backward passes cannot represent classes of problems specifically
interesting for long-running agentic tasks. We further conjecture a critical
time t beyond which non-recurrence-complete models fail to aggregate inputs
correctly, with concrete implications for agentic systems (e.g., software
engineering agents). To address this, we introduce a recurrence-complete
architecture and train it on GitHub-derived action sequences. Loss follows a
power law in the trained sequence length while the parameter count remains
fixed. Moreover, longer-sequence training always amortizes its linearly
increasing wall-time cost, yielding lower loss as a function of wall time.

Abstract: Alarm data is pivotal in curbing fault behavior in Wind Turbines (WTs) and
forms the backbone for advancedpredictive monitoring systems. Traditionally,
research cohorts have been confined to utilizing alarm data solelyas a
diagnostic tool, merely indicative of unhealthy status. However, this study
aims to offer a transformativeleap towards preempting alarms, preventing alarms
from triggering altogether, and consequently avertingimpending failures. Our
proposed Alarm Forecasting and Classification (AFC) framework is designed on
twosuccessive modules: first, the regression module based on long short-term
memory (LSTM) for time-series alarmforecasting, and thereafter, the
classification module to implement alarm tagging on the forecasted alarm.
Thisway, the entire alarm taxonomy can be forecasted reliably rather than a few
specific alarms. 14 Senvion MM82turbines with an operational period of 5 years

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in numerous machine learning and artificial
intelligence models. This work focuses on the acceleration of attention kernel
using FlashAttention algorithm, in vector processors, particularly those based
on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). This work represents the
first effort to vectorize FlashAttention, minimizing scalar code and
simplifying the computational complexity of evaluating exponentials needed by
softmax used in attention. By utilizing a low-cost approximation for
exponentials in floating-point arithmetic, we reduce the cost of computing the
exponential function without the need to extend baseline vector ISA with new
custom instructions. Also, appropriate tiling strategies are explored with the
goal to improve memory locality. Experimental results highlight the scalability
of our approach, demonstrating significant performance gains with the
vectorized implementations when processing attention layers in practical
applications.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures offer
strengths for modeling temporal data: CNNs excel at capturing local patterns
and translational invariances, while transformers effectively model long-range
dependencies via self-attention. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture
integrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer
(TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module
first applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill
salient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and
dimensionality. The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which
applies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies
and to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a
hydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models,
with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the
model is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head
attention weights (SHAP-MHAW). Our novel architecture, named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW,
is promising for applications requiring high-fidelity, multivariate time series
forecasts, being available for future analysis at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计方法（如Altman Z-Score）存在假设僵化和预测精度低的问题，需要更准确有效的银行破产预测方法来维护金融系统稳定。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、随机森林和支持向量机三种机器学习方法，分别基于土耳其44家活跃银行和21家破产银行的年度财务报表（1994-2004），以及印尼43家活跃和43家破产农村银行的季度财务报告（2013-2019）进行建模。

Conclusion: 提出的创新机器学习方法有助于实施降低破产成本的政策，为银行风险管理提供更有效的工具。

Abstract: Context: Financial system stability is determined by the condition of the
banking system. A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial
system, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual
banks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the
probability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is
safe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such
as Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a
bankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and
sometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.
New approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are
developed using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),
random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several
studies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical
methods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present
Research: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial
statements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to
2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports
of 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.
Five rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the
feasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The
results of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from
commercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine
learning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank
bankruptcy. Contribution and Conclusion: The proposed innovative machine
learning approach help to implement policies that reduce the costs of
bankruptcy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合异构消息传递神经网络(HH-MPNN)，用于解决交流最优潮流(ACOPF)问题，实现了在14-2000节点电网上的可扩展性和拓扑适应性，计算速度比内点法快1000-10000倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ACOPF求解器计算成本高，机器学习方法虽然能加速计算但缺乏可扩展性和拓扑适应性，需要昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 使用混合异构消息传递神经网络，将电网中的母线、发电机、负荷、并联设备、输电线路和变压器建模为不同的节点或边类型，结合可扩展的Transformer模型处理长程依赖关系。

Result: 在默认拓扑上达到小于1%的最优性差距；零样本应用于数千个未见拓扑时，最优性差距小于3%；在较小电网上预训练可改善较大电网的结果；计算速度比内点法快1000-10000倍。

Conclusion: HH-MPNN为实时电力系统操作提供了实用、可泛化的机器学习解决方案，推进了电力系统优化领域的发展。

Abstract: AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale
power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times.
Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with
scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable
scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose
a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models
buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as
distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for
handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN
achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot
to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap
despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also
improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to
10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical,
generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SaFeR-VLM框架，通过安全对齐的强化学习将安全直接嵌入多模态推理过程，解决了多模态大推理模型在对抗性或不安全提示下放大安全风险的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大推理模型在跨模态推理方面表现出色，但在对抗性或不安全提示下会放大安全风险，这种现象被称为"推理税"。现有防御主要在输出层面，未能约束推理过程，使模型面临隐式风险。

Method: SaFeR-VLM框架包含四个组件：(I) QI-Safe-10K数据集，强调安全关键和推理敏感案例；(II) 安全感知的rollout，不安全生成经过反思和修正而非丢弃；(III) 结构化奖励建模，具有多维加权标准和明确惩罚幻觉和矛盾；(IV) GRPO优化，强化安全和修正的轨迹。

Result: SaFeR-VLM-3B在六个基准测试中安全性和帮助性平均得分分别为70.13和78.97，超越了同规模和>10倍大的模型。SaFeR-VLM-7B在安全指标上分别超过GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash 6.47和16.76分，且不降低帮助性性能。

Conclusion: 该框架将安全从被动保护转变为推理的主动驱动，支持可扩展和通用的安全感知推理，对显式和隐式风险均表现出鲁棒性，超越了表面级过滤的安全决策。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal
reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a
phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at
the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models
exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a
safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly
into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I)
QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and
reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations
undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured
reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties
for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which
reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts
safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling
scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further
demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting
dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.
SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and
helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$
larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B.
Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass
GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points
respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any
degradation in helpfulness performance. Our codes are available at

Conclusion: MoRE-GNN提供了一个自适应、可扩展且可解释的多组学整合框架，尽管性能可能随数据集复杂度变化，但整体表现优秀。

Abstract: The integration of multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging due to
high-dimensionality and complex inter-modality relationships. To address this,
we introduce MoRE-GNN (Multi-omics Relational Edge Graph Neural Network), a
heterogeneous graph autoencoder that combines graph convolution and attention
mechanisms to dynamically construct relational graphs directly from data.
Evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN
captures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing
methods, particularly in settings with strong inter-modality correlations.
Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream
cross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity,
MoRE-GNN offers an adaptive, scalable and interpretable framework for advancing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度约束聚类方法要么受限于端到端建模中的锚点问题，要么难以学习判别性欧几里得嵌入，限制了可扩展性和实际应用。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中与最先进的深度约束聚类方法比较，验证了其优越性能、可扩展性和实际有效性。

Conclusion: SpherePair方法能够保持成对关系无冲突、无需指定确切聚类数量、泛化到未见数据、快速推断聚类数量，并具有严格的理论保证。

Abstract: Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise
constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are
either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with
learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and
real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a
novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using
the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes
pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in
angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering.
SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to
specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid
inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical
guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on
diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights,
confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world
effectiveness. Code is available at

TL;DR: DecompGAIL通过分解真实感为ego-map和ego-neighbor组件，过滤误导性的邻居间交互，结合社会PPO目标，在WOMD Sim Agents 2025基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法难以模拟真实交通行为：行为克隆存在协变量偏移问题，而生成对抗模仿学习在多智能体设置中不稳定，主要原因是无关交互误导。

Method: 提出分解多智能体GAIL，将真实感分解为ego-map和ego-neighbor组件，过滤邻居间和邻居与地图的误导性交互；引入社会PPO目标，用距离加权的邻居奖励增强自我奖励。

Result: 在轻量级SMART骨干网络上集成DecompGAIL，在WOMD Sim Agents 2025基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DecompGAIL通过分解真实感和过滤误导性交互，有效解决了多智能体模仿学习中的稳定性问题，提升了交通模拟的真实性。

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous
driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning
approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning
suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
(GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key
source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a
discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic
interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed
Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map
and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and
neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that
augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging
overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based
backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim
Agents 2025 benchmark.

Result: 在公开数据集上达到竞争性性能，同时显著降低能耗，在太阳能逆变器功率削减事件检测中验证了实用性

Conclusion: 该方法为可持续和高效的异常检测提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a key task across domains such as industry, healthcare,
and cybersecurity. Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing
multiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for
such problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in
this field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their
deployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge
computing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces the \textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural
Network-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a
new detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather
than reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike
Time-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural
activity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also
proposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals,
assigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a
single spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to
conventional encoding methods. Experimental results on publicly available
datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance
while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to a wide set of deep
learning and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, its practical utility is
validated in a real-world case study, where the model successfully identifies
power curtailment events in a solar inverter. These results highlight its
potential for sustainable and efficient anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 提出分组差分注意力（GDA），通过不平衡的头部分配策略，将更多注意力头分配给信号提取组，更少分配给噪声控制组，从而在最小计算开销下增强信号保真度和模型可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自注意力机制存在效率问题，经常将大量注意力分配给冗余或噪声上下文。现有的差分注意力方法虽然通过减法注意力图处理信号和噪声，但其平衡的头部分配限制了表示灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: GDA采用不平衡头部分配策略，将注意力头分为信号保留组和噪声控制组，为信号提取分配更多头部，为噪声控制分配较少头部并通过受控重复来稳定。还提出组差异化增长策略，仅选择性复制信号聚焦头部以实现高效容量扩展。

Result: 大规模预训练和持续训练实验表明，GDA中的适度不平衡比率相比对称基线在泛化性和稳定性方面带来显著改进。

Conclusion: 比率感知的头部分配和选择性扩展为设计可扩展、计算高效的Transformer架构提供了有效且实用的路径。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, while foundational to modern Transformer
architectures, suffers from a critical inefficiency: it frequently allocates
substantial attention to redundant or noisy context. Differential Attention
addressed this by using subtractive attention maps for signal and noise, but
its required balanced head allocation imposes rigid constraints on
representational flexibility and scalability.
  To overcome this, we propose Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a novel
approach that introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving
and noise-control groups. GDA significantly enhances signal focus by
strategically assigning more heads to signal extraction and fewer to
noise-control, stabilizing the latter through controlled repetition (akin to
GQA). This design achieves stronger signal fidelity with minimal computational
overhead. We further extend this principle to group-differentiated growth, a
scalable strategy that selectively replicates only the signal-focused heads,
thereby ensuring efficient capacity expansion.
  Through large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments, we
demonstrate that moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial
improvements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines.
Our results collectively establish that ratio-aware head allocation and
selective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing
scalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.

We examine two classification tasks: (i) a binary classification problem
focused on predicting driver alertness states, and (ii) a multilabel
classification problem based on the yeast dataset. Three state-of-the-art LLMs
(i.e. OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek) are prompted to design
training pipelines for four common classifiers: Random Forest, XGBoost,
Multilayer Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. The generated
models are evaluated in terms of predictive performance (recall, precision, and
F1-score) and explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
Specifically, we measure Average SHAP Fidelity (Mean Squared Error between SHAP
approximations and model outputs) and Average SHAP Sparsity (number of features
deemed influential). The results reveal that LLMs are capable of producing
effective and interpretable models, achieving high fidelity and consistent
sparsity, highlighting their potential as automated tools for interpretable ML
pipeline generation. The results show that LLMs can produce effective,
interpretable pipelines with high fidelity and consistent sparsity, closely

Motivation: 联邦学习中的数据删除面临两大挑战：公平性问题（现有方法对所有客户端强制重训练或粗粒度干预）和评估不现实（依赖合成数据假设，忽略真实异构性）

Method: 提出FedCCCU方法，通过联邦跨客户端约束删除机制，在保证公平性的同时实现高效数据删除

Result: 实验表明现有方法在真实场景下表现不佳，而FedCCCU方法在所有测试中均优于现有方法

Conclusion: FedCCCU为现实世界联邦学习数据删除提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，有效解决了公平性和异构数据挑战

Abstract: Machine unlearning is critical for enforcing data deletion rights like the
"right to be forgotten." As a decentralized paradigm, Federated Learning (FL)
also requires unlearning, but realistic implementations face two major
challenges. First, fairness in Federated Unlearning (FU) is often overlooked.
Exact unlearning methods typically force all clients into costly retraining,
even those uninvolved. Approximate approaches, using gradient ascent or
distillation, make coarse interventions that can unfairly degrade performance
for clients with only retained data. Second, most FU evaluations rely on
synthetic data assumptions (IID/non-IID) that ignore real-world heterogeneity.
These unrealistic benchmarks obscure the true impact of unlearning and limit
the applicability of current methods. We first conduct a comprehensive
benchmark of existing FU methods under realistic data heterogeneity and
fairness conditions. We then propose a novel, fairness-aware FU approach,
Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), to explicitly address
both challenges. FedCCCU offers a practical and scalable solution for
real-world FU. Experimental results show that existing methods perform poorly
in realistic settings, while our approach consistently outperforms them.

Conclusion: FlexMol框架能够学习统一的分子表示，支持单模态输入，在数据不完整场景下表现鲁棒。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing
applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work
leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training,
aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However,
these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model
effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing
limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or
computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose
FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified
molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically,
inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach
employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter
sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate
features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous
learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during
training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior
performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we
also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code

Abstract: Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal
graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender
systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting
state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity
prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving
Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in
training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction
and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS -
Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the
equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising,
training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss
function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that
it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is

Motivation: 研究语义在自监督定位框架中对定位性能和鲁棒性的影响，探究模型是否能够过滤环境噪声并优先识别显著地标。

Method: 训练定位网络于原始和扰动地图上，进行事后内省分析，验证多种可解释性方法，并进行语义类别消融实验。

Conclusion: 模型能够学习噪声鲁棒的语义显著关系，从而在具有挑战性的视觉和结构变化下实现可解释的配准。

Abstract: This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and
robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation
framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed
maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether
the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks
over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present
a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights
consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A
semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent
objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model
learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition,
thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and
structural variations.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了量子神经网络中基于Fisher信息矩阵的评估指标如何有效预测训练和预测性能，揭示了有效维度和模型偏差之间的相互作用及其对训练的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子机器学习特别是量子神经网络兴趣的增长，研究基于Fisher信息矩阵的评估指标如何有效预测QNNs的训练和预测性能。

Method: 利用QNNs与傅里叶模型的等价性，推导傅里叶模型的FIM解析表达式，构建具有可调有效维度和偏差的模型，并比较它们的训练过程。

Result: 对于完全无偏的模型，更高的有效维度可能带来更好的可训练性和性能；而对于偏向目标函数的模型，较低的有效维度在训练中可能更有益。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了几何特性、模型-任务对齐和训练之间相互作用的具体示例，对更广泛的机器学习社区具有相关性。

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular
quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation
metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for
predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the
equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the
interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model
towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and
performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased,
towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results
in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that
are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is
likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an
analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features
controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models
with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We
furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier
models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN
models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay
between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are
relevant for the broader machine learning community.

Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在时间序列预测中过度强调时间依赖性，导致计算开销增加但性能提升有限，性能高度依赖于嵌入方法的质量

Method: 提出HTME嵌入提取器，集成轻量级时间特征提取模块和精心设计的多变量特征提取模块，提供互补特征，平衡模型复杂度和性能

Result: 在8个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: HTMformer通过增强的特征提取能力构建了轻量级预测器，证明了改进嵌入方法对提升Transformer在时间序列预测中性能的重要性

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in time series
forecasting. However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in
sequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This
incurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding
performance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly
dependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To
address this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective
information captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional
embeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations.
These representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand
the series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate
Embeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature
extraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction
module to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between
model complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer
architecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction
capability of the HTME extractor to build a lightweight forecaster. Experiments
conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文使用梯度流分析框架研究线性化Transformer的训练动态，发现注意力模块训练分为两个阶段：第一阶段权重扰动促进逃离小初始化，第二阶段键查询矩阵参与训练导致秩塌缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型表现出优异的实证性能，但其训练动态的基本原理在配置特定研究之外缺乏充分表征。受语言模型在小初始化尺度下改进推理能力的实证证据启发，需要系统研究Transformer训练动态。

Method: 采用[Zhou et al. NeurIPS 2022]建立的梯度流分析框架，系统研究线性化Transformer训练动态，理论分析将注意力模块动态分解为两个不同阶段。

Result: 第一阶段：随机初始化的不对称权重扰动维持参数矩阵中的非退化梯度动态，促进系统逃离小初始化；第二阶段：先前静态的键查询矩阵积极参与训练，驱动归一化矩阵向渐近秩塌缩发展。

Conclusion: 这个两阶段框架推广了经典的方向收敛结果，为理解Transformer训练动态提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown exceptional empirical
performance, the fundamental principles governing their training dynamics are
inadequately characterized beyond configuration-specific studies. Inspired by
empirical evidence showing improved reasoning capabilities under small
initialization scales in language models, we employ the gradient flow
analytical framework established in [Zhou et al. NeurIPS 2022] to
systematically investigate linearized Transformer training dynamics. Our
theoretical analysis dissects the dynamics of attention modules into two
distinct stages. In the first stage, asymmetric weight perturbations from
random initialization sustain non-degenerate gradient dynamics in parameter
matrices, facilitating systematic escape from small initialization regimes.
Subsequently, these matrices undergo condensation, progressively aligning
toward the target orientation. In the second stage, the previously static
key-query matrices actively participate in training, driving the normalized
matrices toward asymptotic rank collapse. This two-stage framework generalizes
classical directional convergence results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无状态推理方法在处理多步骤任务时由于缺乏持久状态而表现不佳，任务特定的微调方法在需要深度推理和长距离依赖的任务上仍然脆弱。

Method: 结合持久推理状态、对抗性变异和进化保留的状态保持多智能体进化搜索框架，通过专门的智能体顺序提出、变异和评分候选方案，控制器在代际间保持持久状态。

Conclusion: 将持久推理状态与进化搜索相结合，能显著改进单元测试生成的效果。

Abstract: Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured,
multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on
multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,
task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level
code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and
long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful
multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from
prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,
(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of
edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,
where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A
controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary
preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This
yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge
cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent
inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless
single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as
HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,
Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time
state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixout是一种替代Dropout的随机正则化技术，通过在训练中概率性地将微调权重与预训练权重交换来平衡适应性和先验知识保留，在领域泛化任务中表现出色且大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成多个微调模型能提高分布偏移下的鲁棒性，但计算和存储成本高；Dropout虽轻量但会破坏预训练模型的关键表示。需要一种既能保持泛化能力又能降低计算成本的方法。

Method: 提出High-rate Mixout方法，使用高掩码概率（ViT为0.9，ResNet为0.8）在训练时随机将微调权重替换为预训练权重，惩罚偏离预训练参数的行为。

Result: 在PACS、VLCS、OfficeHome、TerraIncognita和DomainNet五个领域泛化基准测试中，使用ResNet和ViT架构，High-rate Mixout达到了与集成方法相当的域外准确率，同时梯度计算减少45%，梯度内存使用减少90%。

Conclusion: High-rate Mixout在领域泛化任务中实现了与集成方法相当的性能，同时显著降低了训练成本，为高效领域泛化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is
a common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes
with substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store
multiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating
ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to
pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical
representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate
Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to
Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout
mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned
weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby
maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our
study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain
generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9
for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it
yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates
more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting
better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking
substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by
up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five
domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and
DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach,
High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based
methods while significantly reducing training costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实机器人需要在部分可观测性和长视野下行动，但现有方法依赖瞬时信息，标准循环或Transformer模型难以处理长期依赖关系

Method: 每层维护记忆嵌入，通过双向交叉注意力与记忆交互，使用LRU记忆模块通过替换或凸混合进行更新

Result: 将有效视野扩展到注意力窗口的100,000倍，在T-Maze任务中达到100%成功率，在POPGym和MIKASA-Robo稀疏奖励任务中显著超越基线

Conclusion: 结构化、层局部外部记忆为部分可观测性下的决策提供简单可扩展的方法

Abstract: Real-world robotic agents must act under partial observability and long
horizons, where key cues may appear long before they affect decision making.
However, most modern approaches rely solely on instantaneous information,
without incorporating insights from the past. Standard recurrent or transformer
models struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies: context
windows truncate history, while naive memory extensions fail under scale and
sparsity. We propose ELMUR (External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite), a
transformer architecture with structured external memory. Each layer maintains
memory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and
updates them through an Least Recently Used (LRU) memory module using
replacement or convex blending. ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000
times beyond the attention window and achieves a 100% success rate on a
synthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it
outperforms baselines on more than half of the tasks. On MIKASA-Robo
sparse-reward manipulation tasks with visual observations, it nearly doubles
the performance of strong baselines. These results demonstrate that structured,
layer-local external memory offers a simple and scalable approach to decision
making under partial observability.

Motivation: 传统微调方法在提升域内准确性的同时会损害模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。作者旨在开发一种方法，既能保持微调的性能提升，又能维持预训练模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出GMixout方法：1) 使用指数移动平均快照作为动态锚点替代固定锚点；2) 通过显式重采样频率超参数调节掩码周期；3) 采用稀疏核实现，仅更新小部分参数，无推理开销。

Result: 在ImageNet、DomainNet、iWildCam和CIFAR100-C等多个基准测试中，GMixout在保持域内准确性提升的同时，在分布偏移下的鲁棒性超越了Model Soups和参数高效微调基线方法。

Conclusion: GMixout通过动态权重锚点和可控的掩码策略，有效平衡了微调性能和鲁棒性，为视觉基础模型的微调提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Finetuning vision foundation models often improves in-domain accuracy but
comes at the cost of robustness under distribution shift. We revisit Mixout, a
stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with
their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing
implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern
robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and
\emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i)
replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that
adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit
resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates
only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling
training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate
shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet,
iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy
beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong
parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.

Abstract: The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance
in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological
structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in
capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates
both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This
paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal
Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these
limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting
hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core
innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism,
implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves
original feature information through residual connections, which is critical
for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity
for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive
experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to
validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming
existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

TL;DR: EvoIF是一个轻量级蛋白质突变适应性预测模型，通过整合同源序列信息和跨家族结构进化约束，在ProteinGym基准测试中达到最先进性能，仅需0.15%训练数据和较少参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质突变适应性预测对蛋白质工程至关重要，但受限于有限的实验数据与庞大序列空间之间的矛盾。现有蛋白质语言模型(pLMs)在零样本适应性预测方面表现良好，需要提供统一的理论框架来解释这一现象。

Method: 将自然进化视为隐式奖励最大化，将掩码语言建模(MLM)视为逆强化学习(IRL)，提出EvoIF模型整合两种进化信号：来自同源序列的家族内谱和来自逆折叠logits的跨家族结构进化约束，通过紧凑转换块融合序列-结构表示。

Conclusion: EvoIF提供了一个统一的理论框架来解释pLMs的适应性预测能力，并通过整合互补的进化信号实现了高效准确的突变适应性预测，为蛋白质工程提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering
but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space.
Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM)
exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by
interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert
demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this
perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two
complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from
retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints
distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure
representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding
calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational
assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve
state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the
training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm
that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving
robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The
codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained
full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common
idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for
quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural
networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the
previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized
model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a
novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in
synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first
demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient
matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and
real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem
of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with
the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors.
Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in
low-bit quantization settings.

Motivation: 当前机器学习工程(MLE)训练数据获取受限，现有基准测试依赖静态手动策划任务，扩展性差且适用性有限，需要大量时间和人工投入。

Method: 采用多智能体管道驱动结构化任务设计和标准化重构，结合混合验证机制强制执行严格结构规则和高级语义正确性，通过交互式执行验证经验可解性和真实世界保真度。

Result: 在224个真实世界数据集上生成606个任务，涵盖多个类别、目标和模态，显示主流LLM在MLE-Smith任务上的表现与人工设计任务表现高度相关。

Conclusion: MLE-Smith能够有效扩展MLE任务规模，同时保持任务质量，为机器学习工程提供了可扩展的高质量基准测试解决方案。

Abstract: While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating
machine learning engineering (MLE), the acquisition of high-quality MLE
training data is significantly constrained. Current MLE benchmarks suffer from
low scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually
curated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We
introduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw
datasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient
generate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality,
real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in
MLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled
with a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and
high-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and
real-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of
real-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories,
objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively
across a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks
shows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on
MLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully
human-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to
scaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的方法，通过合成组合简单问题为复杂多步依赖链，使用结果奖励和自动增加复杂度的课程训练，显著提升大语言模型的长程推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在短程推理任务上表现出色，但推理长度增加时性能下降。现有方法依赖推理时支架或昂贵的步骤级监督，难以扩展。

Method: 将简单问题合成组合成任意长度的复杂多步依赖链，使用结果奖励进行课程强化学习训练，自动增加复杂度。

Result: 在6年级数学问题上进行课程训练，在更长竞赛级基准测试（GSM-Symbolic、MATH-500、AIME）上准确率提升高达2.06倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为使用现有数据扩展强化学习解决长程问题提供了高效路径，理论上证明课程强化学习比全时域训练在样本复杂度上有指数级改进。

Abstract: Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance
drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this
rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of
which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap
long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon
data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,
multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data
using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in
complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.
Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on
composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,
competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.
Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than
baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning
paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards
achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon
training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1
therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon
problems using only existing data.

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个评估LLM智能体在旅行规划场景中能力的基准，将旅行规划建模为约束偏好优化问题，要求智能体在满足硬约束的同时优化软用户偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的LLM智能体需要通过多轮交互掌握策略性工具使用和用户偏好优化，以协助用户完成复杂规划任务。

Method: 构建了覆盖20个美国国家公园的交通、住宿和票务的旅行数据库，以及模拟商业预订平台的综合工具生态系统，将旅行规划建模为约束偏好优化问题。

Result: 评估发现两个关键差距：(i)可接受-最优差距：智能体可靠满足约束但未能优化偏好；(ii)计划协调差距：在多服务协调任务上性能崩溃，特别是开源模型。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过在实际用户导向领域中扎根推理和规划，提供了一个直接衡量智能体在现实任务中优化用户偏好能力的基准，连接理论进展与现实影响。

Abstract: Real-world large language model (LLM) agents must master strategic tool use
and user preference optimization through multi-turn interactions to assist
users with complex planning tasks. We introduce COMPASS (Constrained
Optimization through Multi-turn Planning and Strategic Solutions), a benchmark
that evaluates agents on realistic travel-planning scenarios. We cast travel
planning as a constrained preference optimization problem, where agents must
satisfy hard constraints while simultaneously optimizing soft user preferences.
To support this, we build a realistic travel database covering transportation,
accommodation, and ticketing for 20 U.S. National Parks, along with a
comprehensive tool ecosystem that mirrors commercial booking platforms.
Evaluating state-of-the-art models, we uncover two critical gaps: (i) an
acceptable-optimal gap, where agents reliably meet constraints but fail to
optimize preferences, and (ii) a plan-coordination gap, where performance
collapses on multi-service (flight and hotel) coordination tasks, especially
for open-source models. By grounding reasoning and planning in a practical,
user-facing domain, COMPASS provides a benchmark that directly measures an
agent's ability to optimize user preferences in realistic tasks, bridging
theoretical advances with real-world impact.

TL;DR: 提出结合预训练表示与自动超参数优化的语音情感识别工作流，在CPU上实现高效性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音情感识别中传统超参数优化方法耗时过长的问题，探索在有限计算资源下实现高效模型调优

Method: 使用SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base模型作为编码器，比较高斯过程贝叶斯优化和树结构Parzen估计器两种HPO策略，在相同搜索空间和试验次数下进行优化

Result: GP-BO在11分钟内达到0.96平衡准确率，TPE在15分钟内达到0.97，显著优于网格搜索和AutoSpeech 2020基线；跨语言泛化能力也有显著提升

Conclusion: 高效的超参数优化结合预训练编码器可在普通CPU上实现有竞争力的语音情感识别性能

Abstract: We propose a workflow for speech emotion recognition (SER) that combines
pre-trained representations with automated hyperparameter optimisation (HPO).
Using SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base model fine-tuned on IEMOCAP as the encoder, we
compare two HPO strategies, Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimisation (GP-BO) and
Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), under an identical four-dimensional
search space and 15-trial budget, with balanced class accuracy (BCA) on the
German EmoDB corpus as the objective. All experiments run on 8 CPU cores with
32 GB RAM. GP-BO achieves 0.96 BCA in 11 minutes, and TPE (Hyperopt
implementation) attains 0.97 in 15 minutes. In contrast, grid search requires
143 trials and 1,680 minutes to exceed 0.9 BCA, and the best AutoSpeech 2020
baseline reports only 0.85 in 30 minutes on GPU. For cross-lingual
generalisation, an EmoDB-trained HPO-tuned model improves zero-shot accuracy by
0.25 on CREMA-D and 0.26 on RAVDESS. Results show that efficient HPO with
pre-trained encoders delivers competitive SER on commodity CPUs. Source code to

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于隐马尔可夫模型的无监督角度功率图构建方法，利用大规模MIMO网络中收集的CSI数据，无需位置标签即可估计移动用户位置并构建角度功率图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模MIMO网络中CSI获取具有挑战性，传统无线电地图构建方法需要位置标记的CSI数据，这在实践中难以实现。本文旨在解决无位置标签情况下的无线电地图构建问题。

Method: 构建隐马尔可夫模型连接移动用户隐藏轨迹与大规模MIMO信道CSI演化，从而估计移动用户位置并构建角度功率图。分析了均匀直线移动和泊松分布基站下的定位性能。

Result: 在均匀直线移动和泊松分布基站情况下，定位误差的克拉美-罗下界可在任何信噪比下消失；而在基站受限区域，即使有无限独立测量，误差仍保持非零。在实际多小区大规模MIMO网络中，使用参考信号接收功率数据可实现平均18米的定位误差。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在无位置标签情况下，利用大规模MIMO网络CSI数据构建角度功率图的可行性，为无线电资源管理提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) acquisition is a challenging problem in
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. Radio maps provide a
promising solution for radio resource management by reducing online CSI
acquisition. However, conventional approaches for radio map construction
require location-labeled CSI data, which is challenging in practice. This paper
investigates unsupervised angular power map construction based on large
timescale CSI data collected in a massive MIMO network without location labels.
A hidden Markov model (HMM) is built to connect the hidden trajectory of a
mobile with the CSI evolution of a massive MIMO channel. As a result, the
mobile location can be estimated, enabling the construction of an angular power
map. We show that under uniform rectilinear mobility with Poisson-distributed
base stations (BSs), the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for localization error
can vanish at any signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), whereas when BSs are confined
to a limited region, the error remains nonzero even with infinite independent
measurements. Based on reference signal received power (RSRP) data collected in
a real multi-cell massive MIMO network, an average localization error of 18
meters can be achieved although measurements are mainly obtained from a single
serving cell.

*Shinsaku Sakaue,Han Bao,Yuzhou Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在线结构化预测方法，在非平稳环境中实现了形式为F_T + C(1 + P_T)的累积目标损失上界，其中F_T是比较器序列的累积代理损失，P_T是其路径长度，C为常数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统在线结构化预测中的代理遗憾保证在非平稳环境中失效，因为固定估计器可能产生与时间T线性增长的代理损失，需要开发适应非平稳环境的更强保证。

Method: 将在线梯度下降(OGD)的动态遗憾界与利用代理间隙的技术相结合，并引入新的Polyak风格学习率，通过卷积Fenchel-Young损失扩展到更广泛的问题类别。

Result: 证明了累积目标损失的上界为F_T + C(1 + P_T)，该界仅通过F_T和P_T依赖于T，在非平稳环境中提供更强的保证，并证明了这种依赖关系是最优的。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在非平稳环境中提供了更强的性能保证，通过动态遗憾分析和代理间隙利用技术，为在线结构化预测开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Online structured prediction, including online classification as a special
case, is the task of sequentially predicting labels from input features.
Therein the surrogate regret -- the cumulative excess of the target loss (e.g.,
0-1 loss) over the surrogate loss (e.g., logistic loss) of the fixed best
estimator -- has gained attention, particularly because it often admits a
finite bound independent of the time horizon $T$. However, such guarantees
break down in non-stationary environments, where every fixed estimator may
incur the surrogate loss growing linearly with $T$. We address this by proving
a bound of the form $F_T + C(1 + P_T)$ on the cumulative target loss, where
$F_T$ is the cumulative surrogate loss of any comparator sequence, $P_T$ is its
path length, and $C > 0$ is some constant. This bound depends on $T$ only
through $F_T$ and $P_T$, often yielding much stronger guarantees in
non-stationary environments. Our core idea is to synthesize the dynamic regret
bound of the online gradient descent (OGD) with the technique of exploiting the
surrogate gap. Our analysis also sheds light on a new Polyak-style learning
rate for OGD, which systematically offers target-loss guarantees and exhibits
promising empirical performance. We further extend our approach to a broader
class of problems via the convolutional Fenchel--Young loss. Finally, we prove
a lower bound showing that the dependence on $F_T$ and $P_T$ is tight.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文建立了保形预测在分位数和中位数回归中的效率边界，揭示了预测集长度与样本量和误覆盖率之间的关系，为数据分配提供了理论指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统保形预测研究通常将误覆盖率α视为固定常数，缺乏对α与样本量联合依赖关系的深入分析，需要建立更精确的效率边界。

Method: 使用随机梯度下降训练保形化的分位数和中位数回归模型，在温和的数据分布假设下，建立预测集长度与oracle区间长度的非渐近偏差边界。

Result: 获得了阶数为O(1/√n + 1/(α²n) + 1/√m + exp(-α²m))的边界，揭示了不同α区域收敛速率的相变现象。

Conclusion: 理论结果识别了效率在不同α区域的变化规律，为控制预测集超额长度提供了数据分配指导，实证结果与理论发现一致。

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides prediction sets with coverage guarantees. The
informativeness of conformal prediction depends on its efficiency, typically
quantified by the expected size of the prediction set. Prior work on the
efficiency of conformalized regression commonly treats the miscoverage level
$\alpha$ as a fixed constant. In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds
on the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length
for conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild
assumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n} + 1/(\alpha^2 n) + 1/\sqrt{m} + \exp(-\alpha^2 m))$
capture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$,
the calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\alpha$. The results
identify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of
$\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction
set length. Empirical results are consistent with our theoretical findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DPMM-CFL算法，使用狄利克雷过程先验自动推断聚类数量和客户端分配，解决传统聚类联邦学习中需要预先设定聚类数K的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类联邦学习方法需要预先固定聚类数量K，但在实际中潜在聚类结构通常是未知的，这限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 在聚类参数分布上放置狄利克雷过程先验，通过非参数贝叶斯推断联合推断聚类数量和客户端分配，同时优化每个聚类的联邦学习目标。

Result: 在Dirichlet和类别分割的非IID数据划分下，在基准数据集上验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: DPMM-CFL能够自动推断聚类结构，解决了传统方法需要预先设定聚类数的问题，在非IID客户端异构性下表现出良好性能。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client
heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby
balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most
CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is
impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL
algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of
cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly
infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing
per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each
round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in
this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet
and class-split non-IID partitions.

TL;DR: Bridged Clustering是一种半监督学习框架，通过独立聚类输入X和输出Y，然后使用少量配对样本学习稀疏可解释的簇间桥梁，实现高效预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半监督学习未充分利用输出数据，而密集传输方法缺乏可解释性。该方法旨在利用输出数据并保持稀疏可解释的对齐。

Method: 首先独立聚类输入X和输出Y，然后使用少量配对样本学习稀疏的簇间桥梁。推理时，新输入分配到最近输入簇，返回链接输出簇的质心作为预测。

Result: 理论分析表明在有限误聚类和误桥接率下，算法成为有效高效预测器。实证结果与SOTA方法竞争，同时保持简单、模型无关和高标签效率。

Conclusion: Bridged Clustering在低监督设置下提供了一种简单、模型无关且标签高效的方法，具有稀疏可解释的优势。

Abstract: We introduce Bridged Clustering, a semi-supervised framework to learn
predictors from any unpaired input $X$ and output $Y$ dataset. Our method first
clusters $X$ and $Y$ independently, then learns a sparse, interpretable bridge
between clusters using only a few paired examples. At inference, a new input
$x$ is assigned to its nearest input cluster, and the centroid of the linked
output cluster is returned as the prediction $\hat{y}$. Unlike traditional SSL,
Bridged Clustering explicitly leverages output-only data, and unlike dense
transport-based methods, it maintains a sparse and interpretable alignment.
Through theoretical analysis, we show that with bounded mis-clustering and
mis-bridging rates, our algorithm becomes an effective and efficient predictor.
Empirically, our method is competitive with SOTA methods while remaining
simple, model-agnostic, and highly label-efficient in low-supervision settings.

TL;DR: 研究表明，无论模型和数据集规模如何，仅需约250个恶意文档即可成功实施预训练投毒攻击，攻击所需文档数量不随模型规模增加而增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设攻击者控制一定比例的训练语料，但对于大型模型，即使很小的比例也意味着不切实际的大量数据。本文旨在证明投毒攻击实际上只需要近乎恒定数量的文档，与数据集大小无关。

Method: 进行了迄今为止最大的预训练投毒实验，训练了参数从6亿到130亿的模型，使用Chinchilla最优数据集（60亿到2600亿token）。还进行了小规模实验来研究影响攻击成功的因素，包括毒化数据与干净数据的更广泛比例以及毒化样本的非随机分布。

Result: 发现250个毒化文档在所有模型和数据集规模下都能类似地破坏模型，尽管最大模型训练时使用了超过20倍的干净数据。在微调过程中也观察到相同的动态。

Conclusion: 通过数据投毒注入后门对于大型模型可能比之前认为的更容易，因为所需的毒化文档数量不会随模型规模增加而增加，这凸显了需要更多研究来开发防御措施以减轻未来模型中的这种风险。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks can compromise the safety of large language models (LLMs)
by injecting malicious documents into their training data. Existing work has
studied pretraining poisoning assuming adversaries control a percentage of the
training corpus. However, for large models, even small percentages translate to
impractically large amounts of data. This work demonstrates for the first time
that poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents
regardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning
experiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on
chinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoned
documents similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes,
despite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. We
also run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influence
attack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data and
non-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the same
dynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning. Altogether, our results suggest that
injecting backdoors through data poisoning may be easier for large models than
previously believed as the number of poisons required does not scale up with
model size, highlighting the need for more research on defences to mitigate
this risk in future models.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了宽度为w=n和w=n+1的ReLU神经网络对Hanin和Sellke(2017)提出的反例函数的逼近能力，分析了深度变化对逼近质量的影响以及神经元死亡现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hanin和Sellke在2017年证明了宽度w>n是ReLU神经网络能够逼近任意连续函数的必要条件，并构造了一个反例函数。本文旨在研究在临界宽度w=n和w=n+1时，该反例函数能否被神经网络逼近，以及深度如何影响逼近效果。

Method: 作者通过实验方法，在宽度w=n和w=n+1的情况下，使用不同深度的ReLU神经网络来逼近Hanin和Sellke提出的反例函数，观察逼近质量随深度变化的规律。

Result: 研究发现，在临界宽度w=n和w=n+1时，神经网络的逼近能力受到深度的影响，并且观察到了神经元死亡现象对逼近效果的显著影响。

Conclusion: 即使在临界宽度条件下，通过调整网络深度，ReLU神经网络仍能对反例函数进行一定程度的逼近，但神经元死亡现象会限制逼近效果，这为理解神经网络表达能力提供了新的视角。

Abstract: In 2017, Hanin and Sellke showed that the class of arbitrarily deep,
real-valued, feed-forward and ReLU-activated networks of width w forms a dense
subset of the space of continuous functions on R^n, with respect to the
topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, if and only if w>n holds. To
show the necessity, a concrete counterexample function f:R^n->R was used. In
this note we actually approximate this very f by neural networks in the two
cases w=n and w=n+1 around the aforementioned threshold. We study how the
approximation quality behaves if we vary the depth and what effect (spoiler
alert: dying neurons) cause that behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson Sampling作为最广泛使用的多臂老虎机算法之一，其通过后验采样来平衡探索与利用的确切机制一直是个谜。本文旨在揭示这一核心机制。

Method: 引入"忠实"平稳化方法，将有限时域动态优化问题转换为平稳对应问题，利用Bellman原理研究时间不变的最优策略，将Thompson Sampling重新表述为在线优化形式。

Result: 发现Thompson Sampling可以表示为模仿Bellman最优策略结构的在线优化形式，其中贪婪性通过基于点双列相关性的剩余不确定性度量进行正则化。

Conclusion: 这回答了Thompson Sampling如何平衡探索与利用的问题，并为研究和改进Thompson原始思想提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Thompson Sampling is one of the most widely used and studied bandit
algorithms, known for its simple structure, low regret performance, and solid
theoretical guarantees. Yet, in stark contrast to most other families of bandit
algorithms, the exact mechanism through which posterior sampling (as introduced
by Thompson) is able to "properly" balance exploration and exploitation,
remains a mystery. In this paper we show that the core insight to address this
question stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization
algorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer
to as "faithful" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the
finite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary
counterpart which "closely resembles" the original objective (in contrast, the
classical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins
index, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly
crafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which
leads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens,
Thompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics the
structure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized by
a measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation. This
answers the question of how Thompson Sampling balances
exploration-exploitation, and moreover, provides a principled framework to
study and further improve Thompson's original idea.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFF协议使用判别性特征解释作为反馈形式，但其理论性质尚未得到系统研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，并与监督学习和在线学习等经典协议进行对比分析。

Method: 在一般框架下研究DFF协议，定义了新的维度概念来刻画可实现设置下的错误边界，并在不可实现设置下提供了错误上界。

Result: 在可实现设置中，使用新定义的维度概念刻画了错误边界；在不可实现设置中，给出了错误上界并证明其一般不可改进。结果表明DFF与在线学习不同，可实现维度不足以刻画最优不可实现错误边界或无遗憾算法的存在性。

Conclusion: DFF学习协议与在线学习存在本质差异，在可实现和不可实现设置下表现出不同的理论特性，需要新的分析框架来理解其学习能力。

Abstract: We study the theoretical properties of the interactive learning protocol
Discriminative Feature Feedback (DFF) (Dasgupta et al., 2018). The DFF learning
protocol uses feedback in the form of discriminative feature explanations. We
provide the first systematic study of DFF in a general framework that is
comparable to that of classical protocols such as supervised learning and
online learning. We study the optimal mistake bound of DFF in the realizable
and the non-realizable settings, and obtain novel structural results, as well
as insights into the differences between Online Learning and settings with
richer feedback such as DFF. We characterize the mistake bound in the
realizable setting using a new notion of dimension. In the non-realizable
setting, we provide a mistake upper bound and show that it cannot be improved
in general. Our results show that unlike Online Learning, in DFF the realizable
dimension is insufficient to characterize the optimal non-realizable mistake
bound or the existence of no-regret algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线目标条件强化学习在长时决策中存在时间信用分配和误差累积问题，离线设置会放大这些效应。

Method: TTGS接受任何状态空间距离或成本信号，构建数据集状态的加权图，并执行快速搜索来组装子目标序列，由冻结策略执行。

Result: 在OGBench基准测试中，TTGS提高了多个基础学习器在挑战性运动任务上的成功率。

Conclusion: 简单的度量引导测试时规划对离线GCRL有益，无需改变训练、额外监督、在线交互或特权信息。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) trains policies that
reach user-specified goals at test time, providing a simple, unsupervised,
domain-agnostic way to extract diverse behaviors from unlabeled, reward-free
datasets. Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRL
agents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and the
offline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduce
Test-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve the
GCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds a
weighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble a
sequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner is
value-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditioned
value function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes to
training, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privileged
information, and it runs entirely at inference. On the OGBench benchmark, TTGS
improves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotion
tasks, demonstrating the benefit of simple metric-guided test-time planning for
offline GCRL.

Abstract: We present an algorithm guaranteeing dynamic regret bounds for online
omniprediction with long term constraints. The goal in this recently introduced
problem is for a learner to generate a sequence of predictions which are
broadcast to a collection of downstream decision makers. Each decision maker
has their own utility function, as well as a vector of constraint functions,
each mapping their actions and an adversarially selected state to reward or
constraint violation terms. The downstream decision makers select actions "as
if" the state predictions are correct, and the goal of the learner is to
produce predictions such that all downstream decision makers choose actions
that give them worst-case utility guarantees while minimizing worst-case
constraint violation. Within this framework, we give the first algorithm that
obtains simultaneous \emph{dynamic regret} guarantees for all of the agents --
where regret for each agent is measured against a potentially changing sequence
of actions across rounds of interaction, while also ensuring vanishing
constraint violation for each agent. Our results do not require the agents
themselves to maintain any state -- they only solve one-round constrained
optimization problems defined by the prediction made at that round.

Abstract: Molecular graph representation learning is widely used in chemical and
biomedical research. While pre-trained 2D graph encoders have demonstrated
strong performance, they overlook the rich molecular domain knowledge
associated with submolecular instances (atoms and bonds). While molecular
pre-training approaches incorporate such knowledge into their pre-training
objectives, they typically employ designs tailored to a specific type of
knowledge, lacking the flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge present in
molecules. Hence, reusing widely available and well-validated pre-trained 2D
encoders, while incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstream
adaptation, offers a more practical alternative. In this work, we propose
MolGA, which adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to downstream molecular
applications by flexibly incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge.
First, we propose a molecular alignment strategy that bridge the gap between
pre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations.
Second, we introduce a conditional adaptation mechanism that generates
instance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domain
knowledge for downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on
eleven public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MolGA.
