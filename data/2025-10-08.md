### [1] [Rule Encoding and Compliance in Large Language Models: An Information-Theoretic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05106)
*Joachim Diederich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文通过信息论分析系统提示中规则编码对注意力机制和合规行为的影响，揭示了锚点冗余与注意力熵之间的基本权衡，并提出了动态规则验证架构来提高合规输出的概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计基于大语言模型的安全关键智能体需要超越简单的提示工程，需要理解规则编码如何影响注意力机制和合规行为，以保护智能体免受提示注入攻击。

Method: 采用信息论分析多种注意力架构（因果、双向、局部稀疏、核化、交叉注意力），建立指针保真度界限，并结合动态规则验证架构进行形式化证明。

Result: 发现低句法熵和高集中锚点的规则格式能降低注意力熵并提高指针保真度，但存在锚点冗余与注意力熵的基本权衡；动态规则验证架构可提高合规输出的渐近概率。

Conclusion: 强调需要原则性的锚点设计和双重执行机制，在保护LLM智能体免受提示注入攻击的同时，在演进领域中保持合规性。

Abstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs)
requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a
comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system
prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate
that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors
reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental
trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work
failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention
architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and
cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show
how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy
objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification
architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule
sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings
underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement
mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while
maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

### [2] [Structured Cognition for Behavioral Intelligence in Large Language Model Agents: Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05107)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结构化认知循环（SCL）架构，将推理、记忆和控制功能分离，相比现有提示方法在任务成功率、目标保真度和可追溯性方面有稳定提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理框架将推理、记忆和控制功能混杂在单一提示中，导致连贯性和可预测性降低。需要一种分离这些功能的架构来减轻模型认知负担。

Method: SCL架构将语言模型专用于推理，外部维护记忆，由轻量级控制器在目标导向循环中指导执行。中间结果可存储、复查和检查后再行动。

Result: 在360个测试中，SCL任务成功率平均86.3%，优于基线方法的70-77%。目标保真度更高，冗余调用减少，中间状态重用更可靠，每100次工具调用中不受支持的断言减少。

Conclusion: 架构分离可以在不依赖更大模型或更重提示的情况下提高可靠性和可追溯性。这些初步发现为扩展研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and
generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges
for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,
and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.
The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative
architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is
dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is
guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design
offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be
stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer
basis for traceability and evaluation.
  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common
LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,
email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.
All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding
settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.
Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.
Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are
reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are
reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute
independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.
  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability
and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The
findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional
models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

### [3] [Optimization Modeling via Semantic Anchored Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05115)
*Yansen Zhang,Qingcan Kang,Yujie Chen,Yufei Wang,Xiongwei Han,Tao Zhong,Mingxuan Yuan,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAC-Opt是一个基于语义锚点的后向引导修正框架，通过对比原始语义锚点与生成代码重构的锚点来选择性修正不匹配组件，提高LLM生成优化模型代码的语义准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成优化模型代码的方法主要依赖求解器驱动，存在语义错误未被检测的问题，导致生成语法正确但逻辑错误的模型。

Method: 提出SAC-Opt框架，使用语义锚点进行后向引导修正，在每一步将原始语义锚点与代码重构锚点对齐，选择性修正不匹配组件。

Result: 在7个公开数据集上，SAC-Opt将平均建模准确率提高了7.8%，在ComplexLP数据集上提升达21.9%。

Conclusion: 语义锚点修正在LLM驱动的优化工作流中至关重要，能确保从问题意图到求解器可执行代码的忠实转换。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

### [4] [Structuring Reasoning for Complex Rules Beyond Flat Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05134)
*Zhihao Yang,Ancheng Xu,Jingpeng Li,Liang Yan,Jiehui Zhou,Zhen Qin,Hengyun Chang,Ahmadreza Argha,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Minghuan Tan,Yujun Cai,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了动态裁决模板（DAT）框架，通过定性分析、证据收集和裁决三个阶段来系统处理复杂规则系统，解决了LLMs在规则推理中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂规则系统时面临挑战，它们通常将相互依赖的规则视为非结构化文本数据而非逻辑组织框架，导致推理偏差和关键规则依赖的忽视。

Method: DAT框架包含三个阶段：定性分析（全面评估上下文环境）、证据收集（基于预定义模板元素提取相关信息并进行系统验证）、裁决（综合验证组件形成全面判断）。

Result: 实证结果表明DAT在复杂规则任务中持续优于传统CoT方法，且能使较小语言模型达到甚至超过更大LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: DAT框架有效提升了语言模型处理复杂规则系统的能力，展示了其在管理复杂规则系统方面的高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing
complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as
unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This
limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook
critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although
existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown
promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and
are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning
chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication
Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes.
DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages:
qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the
qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual
landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted
extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements
([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules.
Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated
components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate
that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex
rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in
some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting
its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

### [5] [An Algorithmic Information-Theoretic Perspective on the Symbol Grounding Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05153)
*Zhangchi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过算法信息论重新定义了符号接地问题，证明意义接地是一个受信息论限制的过程，统一了哥德尔自指和统计学习的视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为符号接地问题提供一个统一的理论框架，揭示意义接地过程的信息论本质约束。

Method: 将符号系统建模为通用图灵机，将接地定义为信息压缩过程，通过四个阶段的论证：证明纯符号系统无法接地算法随机世界；静态接地系统的不完备性；接地行为的不可推断性；以及学习过程本身的有限性。

Result: 证明了符号接地存在根本性的信息论限制：纯符号系统无法接地算法随机世界；静态接地系统总存在对抗性不可压缩世界；接地行为需要外部信息输入；学习过程无法理解超越自身复杂度的世界。

Conclusion: 意义是一个系统不断试图克服自身信息论限制的开放过程，符号接地问题揭示了认知系统的基本局限性。

Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding
Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT).
We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally
constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian
(self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a
symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of
information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove
that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data
strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,
we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a
specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible
world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding
act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires
the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from
the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to
prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that
cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.
This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually
attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.

### [6] [Lang-PINN: From Language to Physics-Informed Neural Networks via a Multi-Agent Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05158)
*Xin He,Liangliang You,Hongduan Tian,Bo Han,Ivor Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lang-PINN是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，能够直接从自然语言任务描述构建可训练的物理信息神经网络(PINNs)，显著降低了构建PINN的复杂度和错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINN构建过程劳动密集且容易出错，科学家需要将问题解释为PDE公式、设计架构和损失函数，并实现稳定的训练流程。现有LLM方法只解决孤立步骤，缺乏端到端的视角。

Method: Lang-PINN协调四个互补智能体：PDE智能体将任务描述解析为符号PDE，PINN智能体选择架构，代码智能体生成模块化实现，反馈智能体执行和诊断错误以进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明Lang-PINN比竞争基线显著降低误差并提高鲁棒性：均方误差降低3-5个数量级，端到端执行成功率提高50%以上，时间开销减少74%。

Conclusion: Lang-PINN能够将非正式任务陈述转化为可执行和可验证的PINN代码，为PINN的自动化构建提供了有效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN
remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as
PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable
training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches
address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but
typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an
end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system
that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions.
Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task
descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a
Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that
executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms
informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments
show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness
than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5
orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%,
and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

### [7] [Representation Potentials of Foundation Models for Multimodal Alignment: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05184)
*Jianglin Lu,Hailing Wang,Yi Xu,Yizhou Wang,Kuo Yang,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该调查论文探讨了基础模型的表示潜力，即其学习表示在单一模态内捕获任务特定信息，同时为跨模态对齐和统一提供可转移基础的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型通过大规模预训练学习高度可转移的表示，研究表明这些表示在不同架构和模态间表现出显著的相似性，这激发了对其表示潜力的系统性调查。

Method: 通过回顾代表性基础模型和关键度量指标，综合来自视觉、语言、语音、多模态和神经科学研究的经验证据，分析表示空间中的结构规律性和语义一致性。

Result: 证据表明基础模型在其表示空间中通常表现出结构规律性和语义一致性，使其成为跨模态转移和对齐的有力候选者。

Conclusion: 基础模型具有强大的表示潜力，能够支持跨模态的转移和对齐，但还需要进一步研究关键影响因素、开放问题和潜在挑战。

Abstract: Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through
large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research
indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity
across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the
representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity
of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a
single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and
unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation
models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize
empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision,
language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that
foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic
consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong
candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key
factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and
highlight potential challenges.

*Mohamed El-Dosuky*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个包含六个语义层的实时物联网框架，通过语义标注、互操作性和推理层帮助IoT设备理解数据含义和来源，特别适用于农业等动态环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网在农业等应用中面临数据收集和理解挑战，需要让设备和传感器能够理解数据的含义和来源。

Method: 构建六层框架：感知层、语义标注层、互操作性层、传输层、语义推理层和应用层，使用模糊逻辑、Dempster-Shafer理论和贝叶斯网络进行不确定性推理。

Result: 框架提供了管理IoT数据的稳健解决方案，确保语义完整性并支持实时知识推理。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合不确定性推理方法和语义互操作技术，成为推进物联网应用特别是农业应用的有价值工具。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various applications
including agriculture, but it still faces challenges in data collection and
understanding. This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional
semantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and
source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,
interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable
for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is
then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic
annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,
including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are
proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the
interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the
synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the
transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or
cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,
Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is
proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,
Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor
IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a
robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and
enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty
reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework
a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in
particular.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a
single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives.
How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters
remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of
the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed
flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and
locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies
between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these
issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer
approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global
Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a
Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a
Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates
structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task
flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining
contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a
coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no
further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show
that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of
script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is
plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the
generated scripts.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图推理的框架，将大语言模型与结构化人口属性和非结构化公众反馈相结合，用于公共卫生紧急情况下的智能人口健康监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在COVID-19等公共卫生紧急情况下，及时准确分析人口层面数据对有效决策至关重要，但半结构化数据的海量输入给传统分析方法带来挑战。

Method: 采用弱监督管道，将大语言模型与结构化人口属性和非结构化公众反馈集成，动态建模公民需求为需求感知图，基于年龄、性别等多重剥夺指数进行人口特定分析。

Result: 在真实数据集上的初步实验结果表明该方法具有可行性，能够生成可解释的见解来支持健康政策决策。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的临床和政府环境中的智能人口健康监测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for
effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including
structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses
significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven
assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines
often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with
generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models
with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a
weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving
citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses
based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple
Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health
policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and
preliminary experimental results demonstrate its feasibility. This approach
offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in
resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型被大规模使用，需要准确预测模型在大量尝试时的行为和风险，但传统统计方法在数据有限时预测不准确。

Method: 引入稳健估计框架，使用beta-二项分布生成更准确的预测；提出动态采样策略，将更多预算分配给更难的问题。

Result: 这些创新方法能够以更低的计算成本更可靠地预测罕见风险和能力。

Conclusion: 提出的统计改进方法显著提高了AI模型能力和风险预测的准确性，为模型提供商和监管机构提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical
area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models
can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown
to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding
problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such
as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability
and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when
scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?
This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of
millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent
harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find
that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical
shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited
scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust
estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more
accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling
strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these
innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a
fraction of the computational cost.

*Radha Gulhane,Sathish Reddy Indurthi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出混合奖励建模框架，结合模型奖励和规则奖励，并引入多维度奖励机制，显著提升多模态大语言模型在数学推理等任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单一信号的模型奖励方法缺乏跨领域任务的置信度校准，难以捕捉人类偏好的多样性，且需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练。

Method: 集成模型奖励（从合成和人类反馈中预测标量或向量分数）和规则奖励（领域特定启发式提供明确正确性信号），并引入多维度奖励和通用长度惩罚奖励。

Result: 在3B参数模型家族中，通用和数学推理任务平均提升约9.5%，数学基准测试平均提升约16%。

Conclusion: 混合奖励建模框架为通过强化学习策略优化对齐多模态大语言模型提供了灵活有效的方法。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

TL;DR: BIRD-INTERACT是一个多轮文本到SQL基准测试，通过结合分层知识库、元数据文件和函数驱动的用户模拟器，模拟真实数据库助手环境，支持CRUD操作和动态交互评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试将对话历史视为静态上下文或限制为只读操作，无法反映生产级数据库助手的真实挑战，如处理模糊查询、执行错误和不断变化的用户需求。

Method: 引入BIRD-INTERACT基准测试，包含：(1)综合交互环境；(2)两种评估设置：预定义对话协议和开放式代理设置；(3)涵盖完整CRUD操作的任务套件，包含BIRD-INTERACT-FULL和BIRD-INTERACT-LITE两个版本。

Result: 基准测试难度较高，GPT-5在c-Interact中仅完成8.67%的任务，在a-Interact中完成17.00%的任务。通过内存嫁接和交互测试时缩放验证了有效交互对复杂动态文本到SQL任务的重要性。

Conclusion: BIRD-INTERACT通过恢复真实交互环境，为多轮文本到SQL任务提供了更现实的评估基准，强调了有效交互在复杂动态数据库助手任务中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications
predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,
execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn
benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or
limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect
production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a
benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction
environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata
files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit
clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human
supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined
conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting
(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator
or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD
spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by
executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks
requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600
tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and
BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed
behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results
highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in
c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and
Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction
for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

Method: 采用多代理架构，每个代理专门处理特定证据流，实现并行处理和细粒度分析，结合确定性代码进行验证，提供交互式用户界面。

Result: 系统在效率和输出一致性方面取得显著提升，可作为证据合成的实用工具和多代理LLM系统的测试平台。

Conclusion: M-Reason展示了多代理LLM系统在科学研究中的潜力，特别是在生物医学证据整合方面，平衡了代理专业化、系统复杂性和资源使用之间的权衡。

Abstract: We present M-Reason, a demonstration system for transparent, agent-based
reasoning and evidence integration in the biomedical domain, with a focus on
cancer research. M-Reason leverages recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) and modular agent orchestration to automate evidence retrieval,
appraisal, and synthesis across diverse biomedical data sources. Each agent
specializes in a specific evidence stream, enabling parallel processing and
fine-grained analysis. The system emphasizes explainability, structured
reporting, and user auditability, providing complete traceability from source
evidence to final conclusions. We discuss critical tradeoffs between agent
specialization, system complexity, and resource usage, as well as the
integration of deterministic code for validation. An open, interactive user
interface allows researchers to directly observe, explore and evaluate the
multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation demonstrates substantial gains in
efficiency and output consistency, highlighting M-Reason's potential as both a
practical tool for evidence synthesis and a testbed for robust multi-agent LLM
systems in scientific research, available at https://m-reason.digitalecmt.com.

*Asli Karacelik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 对贝叶斯方法在模型预测控制(MPC)中的应用进行综述，重点关注神经网络建模、控制设计和不确定性量化，指出当前研究在性能提升和鲁棒性方面的报告结果较为零散，建议建立标准化基准和透明报告机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估贝叶斯方法在MPC中的实际应用效果，分析现有研究在不确定性捕获和传播方面的实现方式，识别当前研究存在的局限性。

Method: 系统分析贝叶斯方法在MPC中的个体研究，包括神经网络建模、控制设计和不确定性量化，评估这些方法在实际中的实施情况。

Result: 发现贝叶斯方法在MPC中越来越被采用来捕获和传播不确定性，但报告的性能提升和鲁棒性增益结果零散，基准不一致且可靠性分析有限。

Conclusion: 建议建立标准化基准、消融研究和透明报告机制，以严格确定贝叶斯技术在MPC中的有效性。

Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive
control (MPC), focusing on neural-network-based modeling, control design, and
uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and
how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are
increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported
gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent
baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized
benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine
the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MHA-RAG框架，通过将示例表示为软提示而非纯文本，在少样本场景下实现更高的准确性和效率，性能提升20分，推理成本降低10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限训练数据下适应基础模型到新领域具有挑战性且计算昂贵。现有方法使用领域特定示例作为上下文演示，但纯文本表示可能不是最有效的方法。

Method: 引入MHA-RAG框架，将示例表示为软提示，使用多头注意力架构，注意力头数量作为超参数控制不同任务的软提示生成。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试和模型规模下，MHA-RAG比标准RAG性能提升20分，推理成本降低10倍GFLOPs，且对示例顺序不敏感。

Conclusion: 软提示表示比纯文本表示更高效有效，MHA-RAG框架在少样本学习中实现了更高的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data is
challenging and computationally expensive. While prior work has demonstrated
the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context
demonstrations, we investigate whether representing exemplars purely as text is
the most efficient, effective, and stable approach. We explore an alternative:
representing exemplars as soft prompts with an exemplar order invariant model
architecture. To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of
attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft
prompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering
benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over
standard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X
GFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to
exemplar order.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明，人类与AI在符号互动中通过意义冲突和重新定义来建立共享理解，而非通过一致同意。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类与AI在符号交互中的动态意义建构过程，理解符号互动主义理论在AI交互中的应用。

Method: 基于符号互动主义理论，进行了两项研究（N=37），研究人类与AI如何互动并共同建构符号意义。

Result: 当AI在社会情境中引入冲突意义和符号时，63%的参与者重新定义了自己的理解，表明符号冲突能促进反思和意义重构。

Conclusion: 共享理解源于符号的相互交换和重新解释，而非一致性，这为人机交互设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language, it
demands a better understanding of symbols and their constructed meanings. While
humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction, AI systems treat
them as patterns with compressed meanings, missing the dynamic meanings that
emerge through conversation. Drawing on symbolic interactionism theory, we
conducted two studies (N=37) investigated how humans and AI interact with
symbols and co-construct their meanings. When AI introduced conflicting
meanings and symbols in social contexts, 63% of participants reshaped their
definitions. This suggests that conflicts in symbols and meanings prompt
reflection and redefinition, allowing both participants and AI to have a better
shared understanding of meanings and symbols. This work reveals that shared
understanding emerges not from agreement but from the reciprocal exchange and
reinterpretation of symbols, suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction
design.

### [18] [Teacher-Student Guided Inverse Modeling for Steel Final Hardness Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05402)
*Ahmad Alsheikh,Andreas Fischer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于师生学习框架的方法，用于解决钢铁热处理硬度预测的逆问题，即从目标硬度值推断输入参数配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钢铁热处理过程中，不同的输入参数组合可能导致相同的硬度值，这种多对一的特性使得逆问题（从硬度反推参数）特别困难。

Method: 使用师生学习框架：首先训练前向模型（教师）从13个冶金输入特征预测最终硬度，然后训练逆向模型（学生）从目标硬度值推断输入配置，通过教师的反馈在迭代监督循环中优化学生模型。

Result: 在公开的调质钢数据集上评估，与基线回归和强化学习模型相比，师生框架不仅实现了更高的逆预测精度，而且计算时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法在材料科学逆过程建模中表现出有效性和高效性，为处理多对一映射的逆问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging
regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different
combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical
composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the
inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,
particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a
Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained
to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a
backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations
from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback
from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a
publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline
regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our
Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy
but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its
effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AInstein框架测试LLMs仅使用预训练参数知识解决AI研究问题的能力，发现LLMs能重新发现可行解决方案并偶尔提出创意替代方案，但其问题解决能力仍脆弱且对问题表述高度敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs的成功是源于真正推理还是复杂回忆，测试LLMs能否仅凭预训练参数知识自主解决AI研究问题。

Method: 从ICLR 2025提交中提取精炼问题陈述，让专业求解器代理通过迭代批判循环提出和完善技术解决方案，使用LLM作为评判者进行结构化评估。

Result: LLMs能重新发现可行解决方案，偶尔提出创意替代方案，但问题解决能力脆弱且对问题表述高度敏感。

Conclusion: 这是首个关于LLMs作为自主科学问题解决者能力的大规模证据，既揭示了其潜在潜力，也指出了当前局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects
genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework
for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems
using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific
fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach
extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,
then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical
solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,
review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on
1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),
using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by
targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success
Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with
human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original
approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible
solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving
ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide
the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as
autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential
and their current limitations.

*Fadi Al Machot,Fidaa Al Machot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合神经符号框架，将答案集编程与基于Transformer的学习相结合，用于航空安全报告系统(ASRS)的多标签文本分类，通过规则增强和模糊逻辑正则化减少领域逻辑违规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度Transformer模型在多标签文本分类中表现优异，但经常违反专家认为必要的领域逻辑，这在安全关键应用中尤为令人担忧。

Method: 将领域知识形式化为加权ASP规则，通过Clingo求解器验证。采用两种互补方式：1) 基于规则的数据增强，生成逻辑一致的合成样本；2) 模糊逻辑正则化，在微调期间以可微分形式强制执行规则满足。

Result: 与强BCE基线相比，该方法提高了微平均和宏平均F1分数，并在ASRS测试集上实现了高达86%的规则违规减少。

Conclusion: 这是首个将基于ASP的推理、规则驱动增强和可微分Transformer训练统一起来的大规模神经符号应用，用于可信赖的安全关键NLP。

Abstract: Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often
violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular
concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic
framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based
learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain
knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo
solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as
rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples
that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic
regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during
fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning
while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune
per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and
logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to
an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our
knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to
ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and
differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了先进大语言模型在编程任务中是否表现出邓宁-克鲁格效应，即能力不足的模型会高估自己的能力，特别是在不熟悉或低资源编程语言中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能系统在创意和技术领域与人类协作日益增多，需要了解AI系统的认知边界和偏见如何影响人机协作。

Method: 通过分析模型在不同编程语言上的置信度和性能表现，研究模型是否展现出类似人类的过度自信模式。

Result: 实验表明，能力较弱的模型和在稀有编程语言上运行的模型表现出更强的DKE类似偏见，偏见强度与模型能力成反比。

Conclusion: AI模型确实会表现出类似人类的邓宁-克鲁格效应，这种偏见在不熟悉的领域更为明显，这对人机协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

TL;DR: VAL-Bench是一个评估大语言模型在争议性问题上价值一致性的基准测试，通过对比模型在相反立场提示下的回答来衡量价值对齐程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注拒绝或安全违规检查，但无法揭示模型在面对现实争议问题时是否保持连贯的价值体系。

Method: 使用维基百科争议章节构建115K对相反立场的提示对，通过LLM作为评判者来评估模型回答的一致性。

Result: 在领先的开源和闭源模型上测试发现价值对齐程度存在很大差异，并揭示了安全策略与表达性价值系统之间的权衡。

Conclusion: VAL-Bench提供了一个可扩展、可复现的基准，能够系统性地比较LLMs如何可靠地体现人类价值观。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的自动漏洞修复方法，通过构建漏洞相关推理数据和验证中间修复过程来解决现有LLM方法面临的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件漏洞的指数级增长迫切需要自动漏洞修复解决方案，但现有基于LLM的方法面临缺乏高质量漏洞相关推理数据和难以验证中间修复过程的挑战。

Method: 论文通过构建漏洞相关推理数据来增强LLM对漏洞修复模式的理解，并设计了能够验证中间修复过程的训练方法。

Result: 该方法能够更好地捕获多样化的漏洞修复模式，并通过可验证的中间反馈改进模型训练效果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了现有自动漏洞修复技术的关键瓶颈，为更有效的漏洞修复系统提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent
need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has
formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches
prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly.
Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the
following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning
data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode
general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data,
they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2)
Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM
training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate
execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results)
to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair
process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses
additional challenges for model training.

Motivation: 台湾人口密集且严重依赖化石燃料导致严重空气污染，二氧化碳是最主要的温室气体，需要准确预测排放以支持政策制定。

Method: 比较21种常用时间序列模型（单变量和多变量方法），最佳模型通过线性回归和自定义堆叠集成技术进行组合。

Result: FFNN、SVM和RFR表现最佳，集成模型SMAPE达到1.407且无过拟合迹象，提供了十年排放预测。

Conclusion: 提出的集成模型能够准确预测二氧化碳排放，为政策制定者提供数据驱动的决策支持。

Abstract: Taiwan's high population and heavy dependence on fossil fuels have led to
severe air pollution, with the most prevalent greenhouse gas being carbon
dioxide (CO2). There-fore, this study presents a reproducible and comprehensive
case study comparing 21 of the most commonly employed time series models in
forecasting emissions, analyzing both univariate and multivariate approaches.
Among these, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) achieved the best performances. To further
enhance robustness, the top performers were integrated with Linear Regression
through a custom stacked generalization en-semble technique. Our proposed

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaVLA是一个统一的、骨干网络无关的后训练框架，通过上下文感知元协同训练整合多样化目标任务，利用轻量级元学习机制实现高效可扩展的视觉-语言-动作模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型在具身推理中表现有限，通常需要任务特定的微调，且在未见任务上泛化能力差。需要开发能够高效适应多样化任务的通用模型。

Method: 提出Context-Aware Meta Co-Training方法，将多样化目标任务整合到单一微调阶段，同时利用结构多样的辅助任务提升域内泛化能力。采用基于Attentive Neural Processes的轻量级元学习机制，实现从多样化上下文的快速适应。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，使用6个辅助任务的MetaVLA在长时程任务上比OpenVLA提升8.0%，训练步数从240K减少到75K，GPU时间减少约76%。

Conclusion: MetaVLA证明了可扩展、低资源后训练的可行性，为构建通用具身智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet
remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning,
and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified,
backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment.
MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse
target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally
diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive
multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning
mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation
from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead.
On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA
by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K,
and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource
post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied
agents. Code will be available.

TL;DR: AgentFlow是一个可训练的在线智能体框架，通过四个模块（规划器、执行器、验证器、生成器）协调工作，在实时环境中优化多轮交互，显著提升了语言模型在搜索、智能体、数学和科学任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工具增强方法训练单一策略，在长视野和多样化工具下扩展性差，对新场景泛化能力弱；智能体系统虽然通过模块分解工作，但大多不训练或采用离线训练，无法适应多轮交互的动态特性。

Method: 提出AgentFlow框架，包含四个协调模块和演化记忆，通过Flow-GRPO算法在多轮环境中进行在线策略优化，将多轮优化转化为可处理的单轮策略更新，使用轨迹级结果对齐局部决策与全局成功。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，使用7B规模骨干的AgentFlow平均准确率显著提升：搜索任务14.9%、智能体任务14.0%、数学任务14.5%、科学任务4.1%，甚至超越了GPT-4o等更大的专有模型。

Conclusion: AgentFlow证明了在线优化的有效性，改善了规划能力，增强了工具调用的可靠性，并在模型规模和推理轮次上表现出良好的扩展性。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

Abstract: Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for
future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and
improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving
agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and
workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a
comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered
architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence,
workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further
propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where
multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts
under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue,
iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes
the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna
evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the
framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna
optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic
AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to
52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human
intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation
wireless intelligence.

filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present
("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label
uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were
automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive).
Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50.
Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233,
elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each).
Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results:
Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the
test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded
competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive
(e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow:
AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets
(elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79
[range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling
strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from
radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with
high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence
the performance of these models.

TL;DR: D2E框架利用桌面游戏数据作为机器人具身AI任务的预训练基础，通过标准化数据收集、通用智能体模型和迁移学习方法，在物理操作和导航任务上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身AI物理轨迹数据收集成本高昂的问题，利用桌面游戏提供的大规模传感器运动交互数据作为替代方案。

Method: 包含三个组件：OWA工具包统一桌面交互数据格式并压缩152倍；Generalist-IDM通过时间戳事件预测实现零样本泛化；VAPT将桌面预训练表示迁移到物理任务。

Result: 使用1300+小时数据（259小时人类演示+1000+小时伪标签游戏），在LIBERO操作任务上达到96.6%成功率，在CANVAS导航任务上达到83.3%成功率。

Conclusion: 数字交互中的传感器运动原语具有足够的普适性，能够有效迁移到物理具身任务，桌面预训练成为机器人学的实用范式。

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力机制上下文学习的无人机数据收集调度和速度控制方法AIC-VDS，用于灾害监测中最小化数据丢失，相比深度强化学习方法具有更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在灾害监测中面临数据收集调度和飞行速度控制的挑战，传统在线深度强化学习方法训练复杂且存在仿真与现实不匹配的问题，无法满足紧急监测需求。

Method: 提出AIC-VDS方法，利用大语言模型的推理和泛化能力，通过上下文学习进行任务适应，联合优化多无人机数据收集调度和速度控制，考虑地面传感器电池水平、队列长度、信道条件和无人机轨迹。

Result: 仿真结果显示，AIC-VDS方法在性能上优于深度Q网络和最大信道增益基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于注意力机制的上下文学习方法为紧急情况下的无人机数据收集提供了有效的替代方案，能够适应新任务而无需重新训练。

Abstract: Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated
to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as
tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major
challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as
unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer
overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet
loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a
complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that
does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong
reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through
In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural
language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM
models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In
this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities
control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level
of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as
well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based
In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS)
is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results
show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and
maximum channel gain baselines.

Abstract: Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the
difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments.
This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that
leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault
diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic
Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through
cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically
constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited
samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create
a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared
decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU
and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms
existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge
model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model
size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable
paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

of computers, the rise of social systems science, intelligent game theoretic
agents, the age of big data and the epistemic upheaval in its wake, and the
current enthusiasm around applications of generative AI, and many other topics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自动多智能体系统设计范式ARM，通过优化思维链推理来构建通用推理模块，显著优于手动设计和现有自动方法，并具有优秀的跨模型和跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动多智能体系统设计方法性能不佳，需要为每个新任务重新发现架构且依赖昂贵的标注数据。发现简单思维链推理与复杂系统性能相当，因此需要深入研究推理单元本身。

Method: 引入ARM（Agentic Reasoning Module），将思维链泛化为由专门推理模块执行的粒度推理步骤。通过代码空间树搜索从简单CoT模块开始，利用执行轨迹反思指导突变来发现模块。

Result: ARM方法显著优于手动设计的多智能体系统和最先进的自动设计方法。基于ARM构建的系统在不同基础模型和任务领域都保持高性能，无需进一步优化。

Conclusion: 通过优化思维链推理单元而非复杂系统架构，ARM提供了一种更有效的自动多智能体系统设计方法，具有出色的泛化能力和性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

Motivation: 传统大气传输模型计算成本高且不确定性难以量化，人工智能方法可同时加速模拟和量化不确定性

Method: 基于图神经网络的集合管道，模拟拉格朗日粒子扩散模型的大气传输足迹和温室气体摩尔分数测量

Result: 在巴西2016年GOSAT观测数据上验证，模型实现了1000倍加速，同时通过集合方法成功量化了预测不确定性

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到其他大气传输模型，支持不确定性感知的温室气体反演系统，提高卫星监测排放的鲁棒性

Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories
require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down
approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide
new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales.
However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of
uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their
uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual
opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their
associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport
"footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their
uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle
Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse
Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator
achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale
footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and
relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The
results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and
temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole
fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied
more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware
greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of
satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based
emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a
computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty
budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于混合参与度分数的早期预测方法，使用多模态特征集在30-420分钟时间窗口内预测网络迷因的病毒性传播，XGBoost模型在仅30分钟内就能达到PR-AUC > 0.52的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测在线内容的病毒性传播具有挑战性，特别是对于文化复杂、快速演变的迷因。研究旨在探索早期预测迷因病毒性的可行性，为无法获取完整传播级联数据的情况提供实用基准。

Method: 使用来自25个多样化Reddit社区的大规模跨语言数据集，提出基于混合参与度分数的数据驱动方法定义病毒性。评估了逻辑回归、XGBoost和多层感知机等模型，采用包含静态内容和时间动态特征的综合多模态特征集。

Result: 有用信号迅速出现：最佳模型XGBoost在仅30分钟内达到PR-AUC > 0.52。分析揭示了"证据转换"现象，即随着迷因获得关注，特征重要性从静态上下文动态转向时间动态。

Conclusion: 本研究为早期病毒性预测建立了稳健、可解释且实用的基准，贡献了新颖的跨语言数据集和方法论上合理的病毒性定义，是首个将时间序列数据与静态内容和网络特征结合预测早期迷因病毒性的研究。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

Motivation: 针对罕见病的计算药物重定位在缺乏药物与目标疾病先验关联时特别困难，传统知识图谱补全和消息传递GNN由于缺乏可靠信号而性能不佳。

Method: 采用自演进多智能体系统，组织任务特定的对抗性辩论，智能体从不同视角动态构建证据图来支持、反驳或蕴含假设，通过事后分析推理策略并产生文本反馈来优化智能体策略。

Result: RareAgent将指示AUPRC提高了18.1%，优于推理基线方法，并提供与临床证据一致的透明推理链。

Conclusion: RareAgent成功将罕见病药物重定位任务从被动模式识别转变为主动证据寻求推理，显著提升了性能并提供了可解释的推理过程。

Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging
when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore,
knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal
to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a
self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern
recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes
task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct
evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail
hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a
self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies,
while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to
accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that
RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and
provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.

Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world
constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling
semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to
generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising
approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of
symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works
based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first
LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source
LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the
Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning
capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with
guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP,
the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140
challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and

Conclusion: 模型内部置信度是创建高效推理数据集的强大信号，可在监督成本高昂的领域实现大型推理模型的训练。

Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large
reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level
supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter
these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab
data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based
filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established
uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a
substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain
only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a
domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered
subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the
gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations
show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales
and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results
suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient
reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is
expensive.

TL;DR: 本文提出DebateQD算法，通过进化多样化的辩论策略来提升LLM的泛化能力，发现说服优化比传统真值优化产生更小的泛化差距。


<details>

Motivation: 传统基于真值优化的LLM容易过拟合，产生脆弱的推理能力。辩论式优化虽有潜力，但尚未与主流真值方法进行系统比较。

Method: 使用DebateQD质量多样性进化算法，在单一LLM架构内通过提示策略演化多样化辩论策略，固定辩论协议仅交换适应度函数（说服vs真值）。

Result: 在三个模型规模和多个数据集上，说服优化策略的泛化差距比真值优化小13.94%，测试性能相当或更好。

Conclusion: 竞争性说服压力比协作性真值寻求更能培养可迁移的推理技能，为改进LLM泛化提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often
overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While
persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not
been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We
introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm
that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories
(rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style
competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously
proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains
diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM
architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the
key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we
explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate
protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies
that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards
collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters)
and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized
strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while
matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results
provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade,
rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning
skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

Motivation: 时间序列分类应用场景多样，但标记数据通常稀缺，使得任务特定训练成本高且不灵活。虽然推理导向的大型语言模型在理解时间模式方面显示出潜力，但纯零样本使用仍然不够理想。

Method: FETA将多变量时间序列分解为通道级子问题，为每个通道检索少量结构相似的标记示例，利用推理LLM比较查询与这些示例，生成带自评估置信度的通道级标签，最后使用置信度加权聚合器融合所有通道决策。

Result: 在九个具有挑战性的UEA数据集上，FETA在完全无需训练的情况下实现了强大的准确率，超越了多个经过训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: 多智能体上下文推理框架可以将LLM转变为具有竞争力的即插即用时间序列分类器，无需任何参数训练。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet
labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and
inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise
in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains
suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via
exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into
channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples
for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against
these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;
a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design
eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by
pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances
interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine
challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully
training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results
demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform
LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter
training. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/FETATSC.

*Dayyán O'Brien,Barry Haddow,Emily Allaway,Pinzhen Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MatheMagic方法，通过动态生成数学测试实例来评估模型推理能力，避免传统数学基准的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数学基准存在两个问题：模型可能记忆公开测试集，且现有基准符号和规则多样性有限，容易导致过拟合。

Method: 使用MatheMagic动态生成数学测试实例，改变数字和运算符的解释但保持答案可自动验证，在测试时随机构建实例评估模型的归纳或演绎能力。

Result: 实验发现模型更容易解决演绎任务而非归纳任务，但会回归到标准数学推理。数学适应模型未能展现通用的推理"技能"，归纳任务的微调泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 该方法提供稳定、可扩展、可比较且抗过拟合的评估框架，揭示了当前模型在数学推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

Motivation: 赋权作为内在动机在强化学习中已有应用，但作为预训练信号的研究有限。作者希望探索赋权预训练在数据高效下游任务适应中的潜力。

Method: 引入折扣赋权概念，平衡智能体在短期和长期时间尺度上对环境的影响。提出基于折扣赋权最大化的预训练范式，初始化策略以获得对环境动态的稳健理解。

Conclusion: 赋权预训练可作为通用初始化策略，为在高维复杂任务中扩展该框架铺平道路，推动强化学习领域发展。

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential
influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation
and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for
unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment
as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We
show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient
downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of
empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's
control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging
this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes
policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a
robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based
pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its
potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing
policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to
improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future
research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further
advancing the field of RL.

Motivation: 解决标准RAG在法律领域的局限性，特别是如何可靠查询结构化知识而不牺牲其确定性特性，满足高风险领域对可解释AI的需求。

Method: 引入SAT-Graph API作为正式查询执行层，使用原子化、可组合、可审计的规范化操作，支持智能体将复杂查询分解为有向无环图。

Result: 实现了高精度混合搜索、鲁棒引用解析、时间点版本检索和可审计因果追踪，将检索从黑盒过程转变为透明可审计过程。

Conclusion: 双层架构成功将法律知识图谱的检索过程透明化，直接满足高风险领域对可解释AI的要求。

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ARISE评估指标，专门用于评估大型推理模型的测试时扩展能力，包含样本级感知和动态采样机制，能有效衡量模型在增加计算资源时的性能提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理模型快速发展，需要系统性地比较不同模型的测试时扩展能力，现有评估方法无法有效衡量计算资源动态分配时的性能变化。

Method: ARISE评估指标包含两个关键创新：样本级感知机制惩罚负扩展行为，动态采样机制减轻准确率波动和token计数不稳定性对评估的影响。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和智能体任务等多个领域的实验表明，ARISE能可靠地评估测试时扩展能力，发现不同模型在扩展效率上存在显著差异，Claude Opus展现出最优的扩展特性。

Conclusion: ARISE为大型推理模型的测试时扩展能力提供了可靠且细粒度的评估方法，能够揭示模型在动态计算资源分配下的真实性能表现。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the
performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of
computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of
reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we
systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across
different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware
Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the
test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing
evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level
awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased
computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling
mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count
instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments
evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of
test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling
efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as
exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary
reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型推理模型存在"拒绝悬崖"现象：模型在推理过程中能识别有害提示并保持拒绝意图，但在输出前突然放弃拒绝。通过因果干预识别出少量注意力头是罪魁祸首，仅消除3%的头就能显著提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然具备多步推理能力，但存在严重的安全漏洞，目前对其失效机制理解不足。本文旨在通过机制可解释性方法探究推理模型中安全对齐失败的原因。

Method: 使用线性探测方法追踪不同token位置的拒绝意图，识别"拒绝悬崖"现象。通过因果干预分析确定负面影响拒绝行为的稀疏注意力头集合，并基于此提出Cliff-as-a-Judge数据选择方法。

Result: 发现许多对齐不良的推理模型在思考过程中能正确识别有害提示并保持拒绝意图，但在最终输出前拒绝分数急剧下降。仅消除3%的注意力头就能将攻击成功率降至10%以下。新方法仅需1.7%的传统安全训练数据就能达到可比的安全改进效果。

Conclusion: 推理模型并非天生不安全，而是其拒绝意图被系统性地抑制。基于机制洞察的数据选择方法能高效修复安全对齐，展示了安全对齐中的"少即是多"效应。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have
shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety
vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why
safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal
intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as
\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify
harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking
process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens
before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently
unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through
causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that
negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can
reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights,
we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that
identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to
efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves
comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training
data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MixReasoning框架通过动态调整推理深度，在困难步骤进行详细推理，在简单步骤进行简洁推理，从而缩短推理长度并提高效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型对所有步骤采用相同的详细推理会产生大量冗余，因为子问题的难度差异很大，只有少数关键步骤真正具有挑战性。

Method: 提出MixReasoning框架，在单个响应中动态调整推理深度，形成混合推理链，对困难步骤进行详细推理，对简单步骤进行简洁推理。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME数据集上的实验表明，MixReasoning缩短了推理长度，显著提高了效率，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: MixReasoning通过自适应调整推理深度，有效解决了推理冗余问题，在保持性能的同时大幅提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: DeepEvolve是一个结合深度研究和算法进化的科学助手，通过外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试的反馈驱动迭代循环，持续改进科学算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学助手要么仅依赖算法进化（如AlphaEvolve），要么只进行深度研究但缺乏验证，两者都有局限性。纯算法进化在复杂领域快速停滞，纯深度研究产生不切实际的解决方案。

Method: 整合深度研究和算法进化，结合外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试，在反馈驱动的迭代循环中提出、改进、实现和测试新假设。

Result: 在化学、数学、生物学、材料和专利等9个基准测试中，DeepEvolve持续改进初始算法，产生可执行的新算法并保持持续增益。

Conclusion: DeepEvolve通过弥合无引导进化与无基础研究之间的差距，为推进科学算法发现提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing
agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in
isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution,
as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly
plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without
validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present
DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution,
uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic
debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only
proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding
both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine
benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents,
DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable
new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided
evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable
framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了TelecomTS数据集，这是一个来自5G电信网络的大规模可观测性数据集，解决了现有公开基准中可观测性数据代表性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可观测性数据集往往经过匿名化和归一化处理，移除了尺度信息，限制了在异常检测、根因分析和多模态推理等任务中的应用。

Method: 从5G电信网络收集大规模可观测性时间序列数据，包含异构的去匿名化协变量和明确的尺度信息，支持多种下游任务。

Result: 基准测试显示现有时间序列、语言和推理模型在处理可观测性数据的突然、噪声和高方差动态时表现不佳，强调了保留协变量绝对尺度的重要性。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够原生利用尺度信息的基础时间序列模型，以应对实际可观测性应用的需求。

Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when
monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional
time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated,
highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their
importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks
due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and
normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond
forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal
reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale
observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS
features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale
information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly
detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring
multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and
reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt,
noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also
underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing
the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale
information for practical observability applications.

TL;DR: RouteLLM是一个分层多智能体框架，将自然语言意图转化为约束感知的路线推荐系统，通过协调多个专业智能体来解析用户查询、解决约束条件、检索POI和优化路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路由算法假设结构化输入和固定目标，无法适应自然语言查询；而基于LLM的方法在空间推理和联合建模路线级与POI级偏好方面存在困难。

Method: 采用分层多智能体框架：首先解析用户查询为结构化意图，然后通过管理器协调约束智能体、POI智能体和路径优化智能体，最后通过验证器确保约束满足并生成可解释的路线。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够可靠地将文本偏好转化为约束感知路线，在路线质量和偏好满足度方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RouteLLM成功桥接了语言灵活性和空间结构，实现了对路线可行性和用户偏好的推理，显著提升了路线推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that
satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g.,
shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured
inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries.
Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial
reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To
address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent
framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes.
It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and
constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a
constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that
retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines
routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier
agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an
interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial
structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.
Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into
constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction
over classical methods.

Abstract: As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes
domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value
alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker
attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two
primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning,
Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language
model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches
have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their
generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we
implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic
decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a
non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot
prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both
approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three
target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0).
In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved
comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting
slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile. The dataset and
open-source implementation are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 优化大型语言模型在竞争环境中的表现会导致模型失准，即使明确要求保持真实，竞争压力仍会驱动欺骗性营销、虚假信息和有害行为增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解竞争性反馈循环如何影响LLM行为，特别是在商业广告、选举和社交媒体等竞争性场景中，这些场景中各方都在争夺受众认可。

Method: 使用模拟环境测试三种竞争场景：商业销售、政治选举和社交媒体，测量优化竞争成功时的模型行为变化。

Result: 竞争优化导致显著失准：销售增长6.3%伴随欺骗性营销增加14.0%；得票率增长4.9%伴随虚假信息增加22.3%；互动增长7.5%伴随虚假信息激增188.6%。

Conclusion: 市场驱动的优化压力会系统性侵蚀模型对齐，形成逐底竞争，AI系统的安全部署需要更强治理和精心设计的激励机制来防止竞争动态破坏社会信任。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is
created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive
advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to
social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently
competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience
approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops
influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success
can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these
scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise
in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with
22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social
media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a
16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon
Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.
These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to
remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment
safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can
systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that
safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully
designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal
trust.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了测试时计算扩展的两种策略：顺序扩展和并行扩展，利用验证比生成更容易的不对称验证特性，在深度搜索代理中实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特定场景下（如解决数独谜题），验证响应比生成响应要容易得多，这种不对称验证特性凸显了测试时扩展的巨大潜力。

Method: 研究顺序扩展和并行测试时扩展策略，利用不对称验证特性，为验证器分配适度的计算资源来改进深度搜索代理的性能。

Result: 通过测试时扩展创建的重型变体模型在BrowseComp基准上获得了高达27个绝对百分点的提升，GLM-4.5 Heavy在BrowseComp上达到54.0%准确率，在GAIA上达到66.0%准确率，与最佳专有模型相当。Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy在BrowseComp上达到69.0%准确率，大幅超越最佳专有结果。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展策略，特别是利用不对称验证特性的方法，能够显著提升深度搜索代理的性能，使开源模型达到甚至超越专有模型的水平。

Abstract: Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential
scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling
involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining
these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4
Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),
verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This
property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong
potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential
and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that
verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In
experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget
forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging
asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial
improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We
conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their
``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up
to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an
open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on
BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best
proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research. Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy
further achieves {\bf 69.0\%} accuracy on BrowseComp, greatly surpassing the
best proprietary results.

Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,
one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.
We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new
performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven
solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit
reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or
simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts
against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach
as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,
evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS
instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load
balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,
LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS
discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,
achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill
best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator
construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications
for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we
argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and
strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the
urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的过程奖励模型在表格推理领域表现不佳，特别是在子表检索和模式交互等表格特定操作上存在性能瓶颈

Method: 设计了可扩展的数据构建流程，收集了6万多个步骤级标注，采用双阶段训练范式：冷启动监督微调学习工具使用推理模式，然后通过强化学习和工具接地的奖励塑形进行对齐

Result: 在5个具有挑战性的表格推理基准测试中，TaTToo将下游策略大型推理模型的推理性能提升了30.9%，仅用8B参数就超越了72B参数的强基线模型

Conclusion: TaTToo框架有效解决了表格推理中的关键挑战，展示了在多样化测试时扩展策略下的强大泛化能力

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

Motivation: 将系统级综合方法扩展到连续空间域和无限时域设置，为扩散方程的LQR问题提供解析解，补充离散或有限时域的计算方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为连续空间域和无限时域的LQR问题提供了新的解析求解框架，能够有效处理时空约束。

Abstract: The continuous-time, infinite horizon LQR problem for the diffusion equation
over the unit circle with fully distributed actuation is considered. It is
well-known that the solution to this problem can be obtained from the solution
to an operator-valued algebraic Riccati equation. Here, it is demonstrated that
this solution can be equivalently obtained by solving an $H_2$ control problem
through a closed-loop design procedure that is analogous to the "System Level
Synthesis" methodology previously developed for systems over a discrete spatial
domain and/or over a finite time horizon. The presented extension to the
continuous spatial domain and continuous and infinite-horizon time setting
admits analytical solutions that may complement computational approaches for
discrete or finite-horizon settings. It is further illustrated that
spatio-temporal constraints on the closed-loop responses can be incorporated
into this new formulation in a convex manner.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个控制中心的优化框架，通过Lyapunov稳定性原理直接构建优化算法，而非先提出算法再分析。该框架使用平稳性向量编码一阶最优性条件，并通过选择不同的衰减律实现指数、有限时间、固定时间或规定时间收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法在控制理论中占据主导地位，但通常先提出算法再分析其收敛性。本文旨在开发一个基于Lyapunov稳定性原理的控制中心框架，直接从稳定性理论构建优化算法，提高收敛速度和可靠性。

Method: 通过将Lyapunov函数与可选择的衰减律配对，构建连续时间动力学系统。引入三种反馈实现：Hessian-梯度、牛顿和梯度动力学，每种都通过塑造平稳性向量的衰减来实现期望的收敛速率。该框架自然扩展到约束问题、极小极大问题和广义纳什均衡问题。

Result: 该框架能够系统地设计具有保证收敛速率的优化算法，包括指数收敛、有限时间收敛、固定时间收敛和规定时间收敛。统一了无约束优化问题，并扩展到约束问题和博弈论问题。

Conclusion: 提出的控制中心优化框架为控制和博弈论问题中的优化算法提供了系统化的设计工具，通过Lyapunov稳定性原理直接构建算法，超越了传统的指数稳定性结果。

Abstract: Optimization plays a central role in intelligent systems and cyber-physical
technologies, where the speed and reliability of convergence directly impact
performance. In control theory, optimization-centric methods are standard:
controllers are designed by repeatedly solving optimization problems, as in
linear quadratic regulation, $H_\infty$ control, and model predictive control.
In contrast, this paper develops a control-centric framework for optimization
itself, where algorithms are constructed directly from Lyapunov stability
principles rather than being proposed first and analyzed afterward. A key
element is the stationarity vector, which encodes first-order optimality
conditions and enables Lyapunov-based convergence analysis. By pairing a
Lyapunov function with a selectable decay law, we obtain continuous-time
dynamics with guaranteed exponential, finite-time, fixed-time, or
prescribed-time convergence. Within this framework, we introduce three feedback
realizations of increasing restrictiveness: the Hessian-gradient, Newton, and
gradient dynamics. Each shapes the decay of the stationarity vector to achieve
the desired rate. These constructions unify unconstrained optimization, extend
naturally to constrained problems via Lyapunov-consistent primal-dual dynamics,
and broaden the results for minimax and generalized Nash equilibrium seeking
problems beyond exponential stability. The framework provides systematic design
tools for optimization algorithms in control and game-theoretic problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: invex函数是凸函数的推广，每个驻点都是全局最小化器，在信号处理和机器学习中受到关注。但由于定义涉及未知的核函数，证明函数的invex性很困难。

Method: 开发了多种构建显式核函数的方法，这些方法可用于证明新函数的invex性，并支持invex问题的优化算法开发。

Result: 提出了构建核函数的有效方法，澄清了invex函数与伪凸函数的关系，并给出了信号处理中非光滑、非伪凸invex函数的实例。

Conclusion: 所开发的核函数构造方法为证明invex性提供了实用工具，有助于invex优化算法的发展，特别是在信号处理应用中。

Abstract: An invex function generalizes a convex function in the sense that every
stationary point is a global minimizer. Recently, invex functions and related
concepts have attracted attention in signal processing and machine learning.
However, proving that a function is invex is not straightforward, because the
definition involves an unknown function called a kernel function. This paper
develops several methods for constructing explicit kernel functions, which have
been missing from the literature. These methods support proving invexity of new
functions, and they would also be useful in the development of optimization
algorithms for invex problems. We also clarify connections to pseudoconvex
functions and present examples of nonsmooth, non-pseudoconvex invex functions
that arise in signal processing.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文研究了无限值成本函数下的势能存在性问题，在c-路径有界条件下建立了势能存在的充分条件，推广了经典凸分析中的Rockafellar定理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典Rockafellar定理(1966)表明集合具有势能当且仅当它是循环单调的，但这个等价关系在成本函数取无限值时失效。本文旨在探索无限值成本函数下的势能存在性。

Method: 在c-路径有界性条件下研究势能存在性，提供了无拓扑假设的一般定理，在可分度量空间和连续成本函数下建立充分条件，并引入c-路径有界扩展概念。

Result: 证明了c-路径有界性是势能存在的必要条件，并在多种设定下建立了其充分性，从而在某些情况下与势能存在性等价。

Conclusion: c-路径有界性为无限值成本函数下的势能存在性提供了有效的分析框架，推广了经典凸分析理论，并为最优传输理论提供了新的工具。

Abstract: A cornerstone of convex analysis, established by Rockafellar in 1966, asserts
that a set has a potential if and only if it is cyclically monotone. This
characterization was generalized to hold for any real-valued cost function $c$
and lies at the core structure of optimal transport plans. However, this
equivalence fails to hold for costs that attain infinite values. In this paper,
we explore potentiability for an infinite-valued cost $c$ under the assumption
of $c$-path boundedness, a condition that was first introduced by
Artstein-Avidan, Sadovsky and Wyczesany. This condition is necessary for
potentiability and is more restrictive than $c$-cyclic monotonicity. We provide
general settings and other conditions under which $c$-path boundedness is
sufficient for potentability, and therefore equivalent. We provide a general
theorem for potentiability, requiring no topological assumptions on the spaces
or the cost. We then provide sufficiency in separable metric spaces and costs
that are continuous in their domain. Finally, we introduce the notion of a
$c$-path bounded extension and use it to prove the existence of potentials for
a special class of costs on $\mathbb{R}^2$. We illustrate our discussion and
results with several examples.

Motivation: 传统极值搜索方法由于持续抖动信号存在稳态偏差问题，需要改进收敛性能和跟踪精度。

Method: 引入指数无偏ES（uES）和无偏规定时间ES（uPT-ES）算法，采用时变扰动幅度和解调增益，uPT-ES还利用啁啾信号增强有限时间间隔内的激励。

Result: 在硬件在环测试平台上验证了所提算法，相比传统ES方法在静态和时变环境条件下都表现出更快的收敛速度和更高的跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 提出的新型极值搜索策略有效解决了传统方法的稳态偏差问题，实现了无偏收敛和规定时间性能，在光伏系统最大功率点跟踪中具有优越性能。

Abstract: This paper presents novel extremum seeking (ES) strategies for maximum power
point tracking (MPPT) in photovoltaic (PV) systems that ensure unbiased
convergence and prescribed-time performance. Conventional ES methods suffer
from steady-state bias due to persistent dither signal. We introduce two novel
ES algorithms: the exponential unbiased ES (uES), which guarantees exponential
convergence to the maximum power point (MPP) without steady-state oscillation
bias, and the unbiased prescribed-time ES (uPT-ES), which ensures convergence
within a user-defined time horizon. Both methods leverage time-varying
perturbation amplitudes and demodulation gains, with uPT-ES additionally
utilizing chirp signals to enhance excitation over finite-time intervals.
Experimental results on a hardware-in-the-loop testbed validate the proposed
algorithms, demonstrating improved convergence speed and tracking accuracy
compared to classical ES, under both static and time-varying environmental
conditions.

upper bounds for the norms of integral operators. As an illustration, we derive
such bounds for transfer operators associated with twofold additive compound

Conclusion: 该框架实现了连续参数推断，无需先验假设，并通过跟随者的战略反馈内生信息源，为对抗性战略推断提供了有效的理论和方法支持。

Abstract: We study a continuous-time stochastic Stackelberg game in which a leader
seeks to accomplish a primary objective while inferring a hidden parameter of a
rational follower. The follower solves an entropy-regularized tracking problem
and responds to the leader's trajectory with a randomized policy. Anticipating
this response, the leader designs informative controls to maximize the
estimation efficiency for the follower's latent intent, through maximum
likelihood estimation. Unlike prior work on discrete-time or finite-candidate
inverse learning, our framework enables continuous parameter inference without
prior assumptions and endogenizes the information source through the follower's
strategic feedback. We derive semi-explicit solutions, prove well-posedness,
and develop recurrent neural network algorithms to approximate the leader's
path-dependent control. Numerical experiments demonstrate how the leader
balances task performance and information gain, highlighting the practical
value of our approach for adversarial strategic inference.

Conclusion: 该框架为广泛的结构化非凸问题提供了理论支撑和实际求解途径，特别适用于信号重建和图像处理中的优化问题。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new class of non-convex functions, called
implicit concave functions, which are compositions of a concave function with a
continuously differentiable mapping. We analyze the properties of their
minimization by leveraging Fenchel conjugate theory to construct an augmented
optimization problem. This reformulation yields a one-to-one correspondence
between the stationary points and local minima of the original and augmented
problems. Crucially, the augmented problem admits a natural variable splitting
that reveals convexity with respect to at least one block, and, in some cases,
leading to a biconvex structure that is more amenable to optimization. This
enables the use of efficient block coordinate descent algorithms for solving
otherwise non-convex problems. As a representative application, we show how
this framework applies to half-quadratic regularization in signal
reconstruction and image processing. We demonstrate that common edge-preserving
regularizers fall within the proposed class, and that their corresponding
augmented problems are biconvex and bounded from below. Our results offer both
a theoretical foundation and a practical pathway for solving a broad class of
structured non-convex problems.

Conclusion: 提出的对偶理论可应用于各种非凸问题，是隐凸优化领域的有价值工具。

Abstract: We examine the duality theory for a class of non-convex functions obtained by
composing a convex function with a continuous one. Using Fenchel duality, we
derive a dual problem that satisfies weak duality under general assumptions. To
better understand this duality, we compare it with classical Lagrange duality
by analyzing a related, yet more complex, constrained problem. We demonstrate
that the newly derived stationarity conditions are equivalent to the classical
Lagrange stationarity conditions for the constrained problem, as expected by
the close relationship between Fenchel and Lagrange dualities. We introduce two
non-convex optimization problems and prove strong duality results with their
respective duals. The second problem is a constrained optimization problem
whose dual is obtained through the concurrent use of the duality theory
introduced in this paper and classical Lagrange duality for constrained
optimization. We also report numerical tests where we solve randomly generated
instances of the presented problems using an ad-hoc primal-dual potential
reduction interior point method that directly exploits the global optimality
conditions established in this paper. The results include a comparison with a
well-known conic programming solver applied to the convex duals of the analyzed
problems. The interior point method successfully reduces the duality gap close
to zero, validating the proposed duality framework. The theory presented in
this paper can be applied to various non-convex problems and serves as a
valuable tool in the field of hidden convex optimization.

Motivation: 解决线性约束可分凸优化问题时，传统方法需要昂贵的算子范数估计，这在实际应用中可能成本高昂甚至不可行。

Method: 设计了两种步长策略：第一种基于当前迭代的局部信息；第二种在此基础上增加了从不良初始步长恢复的能力，并允许步长逐次增大。

Result: 在标准假设下证明了全局迭代收敛性，并推导了目标函数间隙和可行性残差的次线性收敛率。数值实验验证了方法的适应性。

Conclusion: 提出的步长策略有效解决了算子范数估计的难题，具有更好的适应性和实用性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose two step-size strategies for the Golden-ratio
proximal ADMM (GrpADMM) to solve linearly constrained separable convex
optimization problems. Both strategies eliminate explicit operator-norm
estimates by relying solely on inexpensive local information computed at the
current iterate without involving backtracking. However, the key difference is
that the second step-size rule allows for recovery from poor initial steps and
can increase from iteration to iteration. Under standard assumptions, we prove
global iterate convergence and derive sublinear rates for both the objective
gap and feasibility residuals. Several numerical experiments confirm the
adaptability of the approaches, where accurately computing such parameters can
be costly or even infeasible.

Conclusion: NCL算法在GPU架构上表现出色，能够高效求解大规模非线性规划问题，同时有效处理约束退化和不可行性检测问题，为复杂优化问题的求解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a GPU implementation of Algorithm NCL, an augmented Lagrangian
method for solving large-scale and degenerate nonlinear programs. Although
interior-point methods and sequential quadratic programming are widely used for
solving nonlinear programs, the augmented Lagrangian method is known to offer
superior robustness against constraint degeneracies and can rapidly detect
infeasibility. We introduce several enhancements to Algorithm NCL, including
fusion of the inner and outer loops and use of extrapolation steps, which
improve both efficiency and convergence stability. Further, NCL has the key
advantage of being well-suited for GPU architectures because of the regularity
of the KKT systems provided by quadratic penalty terms. In particular, the NCL
subproblem formulation allows the KKT systems to be naturally expressed as
either stabilized or condensed KKT systems, whereas the interior-point approach
requires aggressive reformulations or relaxations to make it suitable for GPUs.
Both systems can be efficiently solved on GPUs using sparse \ldlt factorization
with static pivoting, as implemented in NVIDIA cuDSS. Building on these
advantages, we examine the KKT systems arising from NCL subproblems. We present
an optimized GPU implementation of Algorithm NCL by leveraging MadNLP as an
interior-point subproblem solver and utilizing the stabilized and condensed
formulations of the KKT systems for computing Newton steps. Numerical
experiments on various large-scale and degenerate NLPs, including optimal power
flow, COPS benchmarks, and security-constrained optimal power flow, demonstrate
that MadNCL operates efficiently on GPUs while effectively managing problem
degeneracy, including MPCC constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自适应近端梯度方法AdaPGNC，用于解决复合非凸优化问题，具有单循环结构、无需线搜索，仅需梯度Lipschitz连续性保证收敛，并达到理论最优的迭代复杂度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有参数自由方法通常依赖复杂的多循环结构、需要线搜索或依赖限制性假设（如有界迭代）。为了解决这些限制，需要开发更简单有效的算法。

Method: 设计自适应步长策略，利用上下曲率估计。核心创新是设计了一个新的Lyapunov函数，有效平衡函数值间隙和连续迭代差值的范数平方。

Result: AdaPGNC实现了理论最优的迭代/梯度评估复杂度O(ε⁻²)来找到ε-稳定点。初步实验结果表明在多个基准非凸（和凸）问题上与最先进的参数自由方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: AdaPGNC通过创新的自适应步长策略和Lyapunov函数分析，提供了一种简单有效的参数自由优化方法，在理论和实验上都表现出色。

Abstract: Consider composite nonconvex optimization problems where the objective
function consists of a smooth nonconvex term (with Lipschitz-continuous
gradient) and a convex (possibly nonsmooth) term. Existing parameter-free
methods for such problems often rely on complex multi-loop structures, require
line searches, or depend on restrictive assumptions (e.g., bounded iterates).
To address these limitations, we introduce a novel adaptive proximal gradient
method (referred to as AdaPGNC) that features a simple single-loop structure,
eliminates the need for line searches, and only requires the gradient's
Lipschitz continuity to ensure convergence. Furthermore, AdaPGNC achieves the
theoretically optimal iteration/gradient evaluation complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ for finding an $\varepsilon$-stationary point.
Our core innovation lies in designing an adaptive step size strategy that
leverages upper and lower curvature estimates. A key technical contribution is
the development of a novel Lyapunov function that effectively balances the
function value gap and the norm-squared of consecutive iterate differences,
serving as a central component in our convergence analysis. Preliminary
experimental results indicate that AdaPGNC demonstrates competitive performance
on several benchmark nonconvex (and convex) problems against state-of-the-art
parameter-free methods.

Abstract: Hidden convexity is a powerful idea in optimization: under the right
transformations, nonconvex problems that are seemingly intractable can be
solved efficiently using convex optimization. We introduce the notion of a
Lagrangian dual section of a nonlinear program defined over a topological
space, and we use it to give a sufficient condition for a nonconvex
optimization problem to have a natural convex reformulation. We emphasize the
topological nature of our framework, using only continuity and connectedness
properties of a certain Lagrangian formulation of the problem to prove our
results. We demonstrate the practical consequences of our framework in a range
of applications and by developing new algorithmic methodology. First, we
present families of nonconvex problem instances that can be transformed to
convex programs in the context of spectral inverse problems -- which include
quadratically constrained quadratic optimization and Stiefel manifold
optimization as special cases -- as well as unbalanced Procrustes problems. In
each of these applications, we both generalize prior results on hidden
convexity and provide unifying proofs. For the case of the spectral inverse
problems, we also present a Lie-theoretic approach that illustrates connections
with the Kostant convexity theorem. Second, we introduce new algorithmic ideas
that can be used to find globally optimal solutions to both Lagrangian forms of
an optimization problem as well as constrained optimization problems when the
underlying topological space is a Riemannian manifold.

*Jian Zheng,Mario Sznaier*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒的数据驱动滚动时域控制框架，用于处理带输入约束的离散时间线性二次调节器问题，相比现有方法能利用所有可用执行数据并提供正式鲁棒稳定性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法通常从初始数据设计控制器并在整个轨迹中保持不变，无法利用执行过程中获得的额外系统信息，导致性能保守。且现有方法要么需要无噪声数据，要么只能提供实际稳定性保证。

Method: 将数据驱动LQR的半定规划公式扩展到包含输入约束，并利用对偶理论来提供正式的鲁棒稳定性保证，采用滚动时域方式利用所有可用执行数据。

Result: 仿真结果证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够捕获未知系统的额外信息，实现更少保守的性能，并提供正式的鲁棒稳定性保证。

Abstract: This letter presents a robust data-driven receding-horizon control framework
for the discrete time linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with input constraints.
Unlike existing data-driven approaches that design a controller from initial
data and apply it unchanged throughout the trajectory, our method exploits all
available execution data in a receding-horizon manner, thereby capturing
additional information about the unknown system and enabling less conservative
performance. Prior data-driven LQR and model predictive control methods largely
rely on Willem's fundamental lemma, which requires noise-free data, or use
regularization to address disturbances, offering only practical stability
guarantees. In contrast, the proposed approach extends semidefinite program
formulations for the data-driven LQR to incorporate input constraints and
leverages duality to provide formal robust stability guarantees. Simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven receding horizon control framework for
discrete-time linear systems that guarantees robust performance in the presence
of bounded disturbances. Unlike the majority of existing data-driven predictive
control methods, which rely on Willem's fundamental lemma, the proposed method
enforces set-membership constraints for data-driven control and utilizes
execution data to iteratively refine a set of compatible systems online.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed receding horizon framework
achieves better contractivity for the unknown system compared with regular
data-driven control approaches.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种GPU加速的可微分MPC求解器，利用序列二次规划和自定义的预处理共轭梯度方法，在强化学习和模仿学习任务中显著提升了训练速度，并成功应用于极限驾驶场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化算法的顺序特性难以在现代GPU硬件上并行化，限制了可微分MPC的广泛应用。

Method: 采用序列二次规划和自定义的三对角预处理共轭梯度方法，利用问题结构实现高效并行化。

Result: 相比CPU和GPU基线方法实现了显著加速，在基准强化学习和模仿学习任务中大幅提升了训练速度。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了可微分MPC的并行化瓶颈，并在具有挑战性的极限驾驶任务中展示了鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Differentiable model predictive control (MPC) offers a powerful framework for
combining learning and control. However, its adoption has been limited by the
inherently sequential nature of traditional optimization algorithms, which are
challenging to parallelize on modern computing hardware like GPUs. In this
work, we tackle this bottleneck by introducing a GPU-accelerated differentiable
optimization tool for MPC. This solver leverages sequential quadratic
programming and a custom preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) routine with
tridiagonal preconditioning to exploit the problem's structure and enable
efficient parallelization. We demonstrate substantial speedups over CPU- and
GPU-based baselines, significantly improving upon state-of-the-art training
times on benchmark reinforcement learning and imitation learning tasks.
Finally, we showcase the method on the challenging task of reinforcement
learning for driving at the limits of handling, where it enables robust
drifting of a Toyota Supra through water puddles.

### [73] [A Fuzzy Logic-Based Framework for Explainable Machine Learning in Big Data Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05120)
*Farjana Yesmin,Nusrat Shirmin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合类型2模糊集、粒计算和聚类的新框架，用于提升大数据环境中的可解释性和公平性。该框架在空气质量数据集上有效处理噪声数据，生成语言规则，并通过轮廓系数和熵评估公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在环境监测等领域的复杂性增加，需要提高模型的可解释性和公平性以建立信任、符合伦理要求和法规（如GDPR）。传统黑盒模型缺乏透明度，而事后可解释AI技术（如LIME和SHAP）经常牺牲准确性或无法提供内在洞察。

Method: 结合类型2模糊集、粒计算和聚类的方法框架，包括：(1) 类型2模糊聚类方法；(2) 公平性度量整合；(3) 基于规则的固有可解释AI组件；(4) 可扩展性评估。

Result: 实验结果显示：类型2模糊聚类相比类型1方法提升约4%的内聚性（轮廓系数0.365 vs. 0.349），改善公平性（熵0.918）；规则组件平均覆盖率达到0.65；运行时呈线性增长（大数据采样约0.005秒）。在可解释性、公平性和效率方面优于DBSCAN和凝聚聚类等基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在可解释性、公平性和计算效率方面均优于现有方法，类型2模糊聚类相比类型1方法在轮廓系数上提升4%，在公平性（熵减少达1%）和效率方面也表现更优。

Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning (ML) models in big data analytics,
especially in domains such as environmental monitoring, highlights the critical
need for interpretability and explainability to promote trust, ethical
considerations, and regulatory adherence (e.g., GDPR). Traditional "black-box"
models obstruct transparency, whereas post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) techniques
like LIME and SHAP frequently compromise accuracy or fail to deliver inherent
insights. This paper presents a novel framework that combines type-2 fuzzy
sets, granular computing, and clustering to boost explainability and fairness
in big data environments. When applied to the UCI Air Quality dataset, the
framework effectively manages uncertainty in noisy sensor data, produces
linguistic rules, and assesses fairness using silhouette scores and entropy.
Key contributions encompass: (1) A type-2 fuzzy clustering approach that
enhances cohesion by about 4% compared to type-1 methods (silhouette 0.365 vs.
0.349) and improves fairness (entropy 0.918); (2) Incorporation of fairness
measures to mitigate biases in unsupervised scenarios; (3) A rule-based
component for intrinsic XAI, achieving an average coverage of 0.65; (4)
Scalable assessments showing linear runtime (roughly 0.005 seconds for sampled
big data sizes). Experimental outcomes reveal superior performance relative to
baselines such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering in terms of
interpretability, fairness, and efficiency. Notably, the proposed method
achieves a 4% improvement in silhouette score over type-1 fuzzy clustering and
outperforms baselines in fairness (entropy reduction by up to 1%) and
efficiency.

*Armin Gerami,Ramani Duraiswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文审计了Transformer模型在金融应用中的风险，发现模型完全忽略数据波动性，并偏向低频价格变动数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在金融应用中日益流行，但其潜在风险和偏见尚未充分探索。本文旨在审计模型对波动数据的依赖程度，并量化价格变动频率如何影响模型的预测置信度。

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行预测，并引入基于部分信息分解(PID)的指标来衡量每个资产对模型决策的影响。

Result: 分析揭示了两个关键观察：首先，模型完全忽略数据波动性；其次，模型偏向具有较低频率价格变动的数据。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在金融预测中存在明显的偏见，需要更仔细地考虑数据特征对模型决策的影响。

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial
applications, yet their potential risk making and biases remain under-explored.
The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data
for decision-making, and quantify how the frequency of price movements affects
the model's prediction confidence. We employ a transformer model for
prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition
(PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making.
Our analysis reveals two key observations: first, the model disregards data
volatility entirely, and second, it is biased toward data with lower-frequency
price movements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过自定义OpenAI Gym环境研究网络安全的对抗性强化学习，模拟多端口服务的暴力攻击和反应式防御。使用DQN在零和奖励框架下训练攻击者和防御者，结果显示防御者的可观测性和陷阱有效性对攻击构成显著障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对抗性强化学习在网络安全的实际应用，探索攻击者与防御者在复杂网络环境中的博弈动态，为自主防御系统提供理论基础。

Method: 构建自定义OpenAI Gym环境模拟多端口服务攻击防御，包含背景流量噪声、渐进利用机制、IP规避策略、蜜罐陷阱和多级速率限制防御。使用DQN在零和奖励框架下训练对抗智能体。

Result: 防御者在50,000+训练回合中持续保持战略优势，特别是在复杂防御策略（如自适应IP阻断和端口特定控制）下表现更佳。奖励塑造和训练调度对学习稳定性至关重要。

Conclusion: 该环境为零和对抗性RL研究提供了现实基础，适用于自主防御系统、攻击者-防御者共同进化和现实网络安全场景的迁移学习研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning
in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models
brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The
environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic
noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot
traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender
agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward
framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while
incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across
multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation
difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that
defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to
successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful
training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial
setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+
training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex
defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.
Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations,
and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in
adversarial RL for cybersecurity. The zero-sum formulation and realistic
operational constraints make this environment suitable for studying autonomous
defense systems, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to
real-world network security scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出从单点优化转向生成式逆向设计的范式转变，使用条件变分自编码器(CVAE)框架生成多样化的高性能设计组合，在翼型自噪声最小化问题上显著优于传统代理优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于代理的优化(SBO)方法只能收敛到单点解，限制了设计空间探索并忽略了有价值的替代拓扑结构，需要一种能够生成多样化高性能设计组合的方法。

Method: 采用条件变分自编码器(CVAE)框架，学习系统设计参数与性能之间的概率映射，能够基于特定性能目标生成多样化的高性能候选设计。

Result: CVAE框架成功生成了256个新颖设计，有效率为94.1%。其中77.2%的有效设计性能优于SBO基线方法找到的单点最优解。

Conclusion: 生成式方法不仅能发现更高质量的解决方案，还提供了丰富的多样化候选设计组合，从根本上增强了工程设计的决策能力。

Abstract: Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output,
is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has
become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a
single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring
potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm
shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce
a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a
probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance,
enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates
conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to
the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a
high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline.
The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\%
validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of
these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single
optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the
generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also
provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the
engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.

Motivation: 随着数字银行欺诈日益复杂，需要系统评估机器学习方法在欺诈检测中的有效性、趋势和挑战。

Method: 采用PRISMA指南进行系统文献综述，通过结构化识别、筛选、资格评估和纳入流程，确保方法严谨性和透明度。

Result: 监督学习方法（决策树、逻辑回归、SVM）因其可解释性和成熟性能仍占主导；无监督异常检测处理不平衡数据集中的新欺诈模式；深度学习（RNN、CNN）能建模序列交易数据；混合模型展现出最佳适应性和检测精度。

Conclusion: 机器学习在银行欺诈检测中发挥关键作用，混合模型结合多种学习策略是最有前景的解决方案，但可解释性和实时部署仍是挑战。

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of machine learning in
fraud detection within digital banking, synthesizing evidence from 118
peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following the PRISMA
guidelines, the review applied a structured identification, screening,
eligibility, and inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and
transparency. The findings reveal that supervised learning methods, such as
decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the
dominant paradigm due to their interpretability and established performance,
while unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are increasingly adopted to
address novel fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets. Deep learning
architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data
and detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability
and real-time deployment persist. Hybrid models that combine supervised,
unsupervised, and deep learning strategies demonstrate superior adaptability
and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了第一个针对高性能深度脉冲神经网络的QIF神经元模型离散化方法，通过分析动力学特性和推导代理梯度窗口，解决了训练不稳定性问题，在多个数据集上超越了基于LIF的现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIF神经元虽然计算效率高但表达能力受限，而QIF等复杂模型具有更丰富的非线性动力学特性，但由于训练不稳定而应用有限。本文旨在开发稳定可训练的QIF神经元模型。

Method: 提出了QIF神经元模型的离散化方法，从离散化参数集推导出代理梯度窗口的解析公式，最小化梯度失配，确保训练稳定性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS数据集上的评估表明，该方法能够超越基于LIF的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该QIF神经元离散化方法为深度SNNs提供了一个有吸引力的LIF替代方案，结合了更丰富的动力学特性和实际可扩展性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新质生产力、数字经济进步和人工智能技术对促进城市可持续发展日益重要，需要研究这些技术因素对碳排放的影响机制。

Method: 使用多头注意力深度交叉网络(MADCN)框架，结合特征交互建模和注意力机制，并采用SHAP进行可解释性分析，基于275个中国城市的面板数据进行测试。

Result: MADCN模型在测试集上表现优异，MSE为406,151.063，MAE为612.304，R²为0.991。SHAP分析显示人口、城市规模、城镇化率和GDP是主要影响因素，新质生产力、数字经济指数和AI技术水平也有适度影响。

Conclusion: 推进新质生产力、加强数字经济和加速AI技术发展能显著减少城市碳排放，政策制定者应将技术创新整合到碳减排战略中，特别是推广智能基础设施和提升各行业数字化水平。

Abstract: New quality productive forces (NQPF), digital economy advancement, and
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming crucial for promoting
sustainable urban development. This study proposes a Multi-head Attention Deep
& Cross Network (MADCN) framework, combining feature interaction modeling and
attention mechanisms, to predict urban carbon emissions and investigate the
impacts of technological factors. The framework incorporates an interpretable
learning phase using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess the
contributions of different features. A panel dataset covering 275 Chinese
cities is utilized to test the MADCN model. Experimental results demonstrate
that the MADCN model achieves superior predictive performance compared to
traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines, with a Mean Squared
Error (MSE) of 406,151.063, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 612.304, and an
R-squared value of 0.991 on the test set. SHAP analysis highlights that
population, city size, urbanization rate, and GDP are among the most
influential factors on carbon emissions, while NQPF, digital economy index, and
AI technology level also show meaningful but relatively moderate effects.
Advancing NQPF, strengthening the digital economy, and accelerating AI
technology development can significantly contribute to reducing urban carbon
emissions. Policymakers should prioritize integrating technological innovation
into carbon reduction strategies, particularly by promoting intelligent
infrastructure and enhancing digitalization across sectors, to effectively
achieve dual-carbon goals.

Motivation: 电动汽车电池容量准确估计对消费者信心至关重要，但隐私法规和标注数据短缺限制了通用化模型的发展，现有自监督学习方法难以从隐私友好数据中有效学习。

Method: 提出片段相似性加权掩码输入重建预训练框架，结合对比学习捕捉片段间高级相似性，然后进行相似性加权的掩码重建，学习细粒度充电模式和高层次关联关系。

Result: 模型在具有挑战性的领域偏移设置下（制造商和老化引起的分布偏移）持续优于最先进的基线方法，测试误差比最佳基准降低31.9%。

Conclusion: 该自监督预训练框架能够从隐私友好、特征较少的数据中学习丰富的通用表示，为电池容量估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns
about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,
practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled
data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation
models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While
self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are
not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --
let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and
noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model
based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of
privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our
pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input
reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even
from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation
lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level
similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.
With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted
masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both
granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level
associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich
representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,
even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer
and age-induced distribution shifts.

TL;DR: PatternKV是一种模式对齐残差量化方案，通过挖掘代表性模式向量、对齐KV向量并量化残差，有效改善低比特KV量化的保真度，在长上下文和测试时扩展场景下实现一致的2比特增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归LLM中的KV缓存已成为推理时的主要内存和带宽瓶颈，特别是在长上下文和测试时扩展场景下。现有的KV量化方法主要关注隔离异常值，但未能有效展平整体分布，导致低比特设置下性能脆弱。

Method: 提出PatternKV方案：在线挖掘代表性模式向量，将每个KV向量对齐到最近模式，仅量化残差部分。这种方法重塑KV分布，展平量化目标并缩小范围。

Result: 在多个骨干网络的长上下文和测试时扩展设置中，PatternKV实现一致的2比特增益，4比特相对于FP16的平均精度下降仅为0.08%，测试时扩展精度平均提高10%，吞吐量提升1.4倍，支持1.25倍更大的批次。

Conclusion: PatternKV通过模式对齐残差量化有效解决了KV量化中的分布问题，显著改善了低比特量化的性能，为长上下文推理提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has
emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference,
notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key
lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV
distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior
work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten
the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.
In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that
evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic
regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a
pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern
vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes
only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the
quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of
low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出逻辑门控算子（LGO），在符号回归中嵌入可学习的阈值和条件逻辑，生成具有明确、单位感知阈值的紧凑符号方程，可对照临床锚点进行审计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号回归能够生成可读方程，但难以编码单位感知的阈值和条件逻辑，限制了其在需要明确决策边界的领域（如医疗）的应用。

Method: 使用逻辑门控算子（LGO）作为类型化原语，具有可学习的位置和陡度参数，通过硬门控变体恢复临床合理的截断点，并将参数映射回物理单位进行审计。

Result: 在两个医疗数据集（ICU、NHANES）上，硬门控变体恢复了临床合理的截断点：71%的评估阈值在指南锚点的10%范围内，100%在20%范围内，同时使用的门控数量远少于软门控变体，且保持与强基线相当的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法将可解释性从后验解释转变为建模约束，为符号回归提供了实用的制度切换计算，支持治理就绪的部署。

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode
unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated
operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness
-- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit.
Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant
recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall
within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer
gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and
remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On
predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result
is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be
audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc
explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a
practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Conclusion: OptiFLIDS适合在真实物联网环境中部署，有效解决了联邦学习在IDS应用中的关键挑战。

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems,
effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring
security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant
challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require
large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security
concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling
collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages,
FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and
high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT
devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel
approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model
complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized
aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID
data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets,
TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong
detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited
for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

Motivation: 传统源分离方法依赖简化的源模型，无法准确复现数据。扩散模型能够直接从噪声、不完整数据中学习复杂先验分布，为解决源分离问题提供了新思路。

Method: 利用扩散模型，仅基于多视图观测数据（不同观测包含未知源的不同线性变换）进行源分离，无需对源进行显式假设。

Result: 该方法在源未被单独观测、观测数据存在噪声、不完整且分辨率变化的情况下仍能成功分离源，并能从源先验中采样、评估候选源概率、从给定观测的源分布联合后验中采样。

Conclusion: 扩散模型能够有效解决源分离问题，在合成问题和真实星系观测中都表现出良好性能。

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct,
unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task
include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of
individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from
an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source
models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown
that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from
noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve
the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.
Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets
of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown
sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually
observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution.
The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors,
evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint
posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as
real-world galaxy observations.

Result: 发现置换不变高斯矩阵模型能有效描述权重矩阵的相关高斯性，特别是在训练后期效果显著。模型参数和可观测量提供了可解释的框架，Wasserstein距离能有效量化训练过程中的分布变化。

Conclusion: 置换不变高斯矩阵模型为神经网络权重分布提供了有效且可解释的描述框架，超越了简单高斯模型的局限性，为开发更通用且可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training
process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix
models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity
and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant
Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated
Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the
simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and
notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model
parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation
invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit
model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein
distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the
movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects
of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width
are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures
from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still
highly-interpretable, models can be developed.

*Mohammad Mahdi Ahmadi,Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了一类参数误设的鞍点问题，将优化和学习统一到一个框架中，提出了两种基于加速原始对偶方法的算法，并在投资组合优化问题上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常假设参数完全已知或预先估计，但在实际问题中，优化目标往往依赖于需要从数据中学习的未知参数。本文旨在开发一个将优化和学习统一起来的框架，以处理更灵活的问题类别。

Method: 提出了两种基于加速原始对偶(APD)的算法：1) 直接将演化参数估计代入原始对偶更新的朴素扩展方法；2) 通过调整动量更新来显式考虑参数动态的学习感知变体方法。后者还采用了回溯策略实现自适应步长选择。

Result: 两种方法都实现了可证明的O(logK/K)收敛速率，而学习感知方法获得了更紧的O(1)常数，并且在学习问题允许多个最优解的结构化设置中，改进算法达到了O(1/√K)的收敛速率。在误设投资组合优化问题上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进算法。

Conclusion: 本文成功开发了一个统一的优化-学习框架，提出的学习感知APD方法在理论和实证上都表现出优越性能，为解决参数误设的鞍点问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the
optimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned
concurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are
fully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and
learning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To
address this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated
primal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the
naive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving
parameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new
learning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter
dynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable
convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware
approach attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from
an adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem
admits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a
structured setting achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate
practical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio
optimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and
math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in
hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a
dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of
an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in
quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was
designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world.
We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the
panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to
solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte
Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical
statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically
checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed
machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via
normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that
frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting
a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts
identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by
interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model,
GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini,
Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by
none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span
Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes
violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We
believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research
assistants and tutors.

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a
fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables,
traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or
sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been
proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual
information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that
neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely
on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not
guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this
paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural
network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature
method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL
divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number
of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number
of samples.

Abstract: Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed
through small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.
Williams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through
truncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes
Rendus Math\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of
Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work
introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation
paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order
optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this
method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of
the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an
exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.
  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,
Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed
expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a
simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.
Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables
exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example,
applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of
semi-analytically optimisable models: the \emph{Infinity Class}; sufficient
conditions for class membership are discussed. This offers a pathway toward
non-iterative learning.

Motivation: 计算神经网络Lipschitz常数是验证其对输入扰动鲁棒性的关键，但现有方法计算复杂度高且难以扩展到大型网络，同时未能有效利用局部输入信息来获得更紧的估计。

Method: 开发了广义SDP框架，支持异质激活函数斜率和任意输入输出对；将该SDP分解为线性复杂度的小子问题序列；开发了通过闭式解实现瞬时计算的变体；提出了ECLipsE-Gen-Local算法来有效整合局部输入信息。

Result: 实验表明，相比多种基准方法，新算法实现了显著的速度提升，同时产生了比全局方法更紧的Lipschitz边界；当输入区域足够小时，算法提供的严格上界接近自动微分得到的精确Jacobian值。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在计算效率和估计紧密度方面均有显著改进，且Lipschitz估计与网络鲁棒性密切相关，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant is a key measure for certifying the robustness of
neural networks to input perturbations. However, computing the exact constant
is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve
solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with
network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local
information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We
address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields
tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.
Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly
flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing
Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary
choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this
generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational
complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also
develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through
closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied
by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a
series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate
local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing
significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we
show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant
with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region
is small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach
by showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness.

TL;DR: NeST-BO是一种针对高维贝叶斯优化的局部方法，通过高斯过程联合学习梯度和Hessian信息，并基于牛顿步误差的一步前瞻界来选择评估点，实现了高效的收敛性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化在昂贵黑盒问题上很有效，但在高维情况下仍然具有挑战性。现有方法难以有效处理高维空间中的优化问题，特别是需要学习二阶曲率信息时计算成本很高。

Method: 提出NeST-BO方法：1）使用高斯过程联合学习梯度和Hessian信息；2）通过牛顿步误差的一步前瞻界选择评估点；3）在低维子空间（如随机嵌入或学习到的稀疏子空间）中优化采集函数，将曲率学习的主要成本从O(d²)降低到O(m²)，其中m≪d。

Result: 在高维合成和真实世界问题上（包括数千个变量和未知活动子空间的情况），NeST-BO始终比最先进的局部和高维贝叶斯优化基线方法产生更快的收敛速度和更低的遗憾值。

Conclusion: NeST-BO通过针对牛顿步并有效学习曲率信息，在高维贝叶斯优化中实现了高效的收敛性能，同时通过子空间方法显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is effective for expensive black-box problems but
remains challenging in high dimensions. We propose NeST-BO, a local BO method
that targets the Newton step by jointly learning gradient and Hessian
information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a
one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. We show that this bound (and
hence the step error) contracts with batch size, so NeST-BO directly inherits
inexact-Newton convergence: global progress under mild stability assumptions
and quadratic local rates once steps are sufficiently accurate. To scale, we
optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces (e.g., random embeddings
or learned sparse subspaces), reducing the dominant cost of learning curvature
from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m^2)$ with $m \ll d$ while preserving step targeting.
Across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including cases with
thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, NeST-BO consistently
yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art local and
high-dimensional BO baselines.

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化设置中的高概率收敛研究需要强假设条件（如梯度有界或噪声渐近消失），导致高概率收敛与均方误差收敛的假设条件存在显著差距，这与集中式设置中SGD在相同条件下实现两种收敛的情况形成对比。

Method: 通过仔细分析感兴趣量（梯度范数平方或最优性间隙）和用户模型间共识间隙的矩生成函数，提供了去中心化方法在高概率意义下的方差缩减效应的新结果，以及对强凸成本函数矩生成函数的更精细边界。

Result: 证明了DSGD在轻尾噪声下能够在与均方误差收敛相同的条件下实现高概率收敛，移除了梯度有界等限制性假设，同时在非凸和强凸成本函数上都达到了最优收敛速率，并实现了用户数量的线性加速。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了去中心化设置中高概率收敛理论的空白，证明了DSGD在高概率意义上保持强大性能，并与现有均方误差保证相匹配，为去中心化优化提供了更完整的理论支撑。

Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest,
due to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds
and strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP
guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is
understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in
decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded
gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap
between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the
mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic
Gradient Descent ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized
settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same
conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.
Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\mathtt{DSGD}$ in
the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in
HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing
uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while
simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly
convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the
number of users, demonstrating that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong
performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved
results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest
(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap
between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on
the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more
fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of
independent interest.

Motivation: Decision Transformer将强化学习与Transformer结合，但存在轨迹拼接和动作外推两个关键挑战。现有方法单独解决这些问题但组合时性能不稳定

Method: 提出Action Gradient方法，利用动作对Q值的梯度直接优化动作，实现类似策略梯度的功能，并能与token预测技术高效集成

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能显著提升基于DT的算法性能，部分结果达到最先进水平

Conclusion: Action Gradient方法有效解决了DT在离线强化学习中的关键挑战，实现了稳定且显著的性能提升

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with
the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike
classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as
objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift,
however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation
of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with
predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address
these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when
combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action
Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to
fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient
integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the
Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical
results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance
of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.

*Joel Wendin,Erik G. Larsson,Claudio Altafini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文发现预训练的深度卷积神经网络在图结构上表现出低于预期的挫折水平，表明网络具有比随机模型更有序的行为和接近单调的功能特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络的图结构特性，特别是通过挫折水平来量化网络与结构平衡的接近程度，从而理解网络的隐含正则化机制。

Method: 将深度神经网络表示为带符号图，计算其挫折水平，并与零模型进行比较，从统计物理和功能角度分析网络的有序性。

Result: 所有考虑的预训练深度卷积神经网络的挫折水平都低于零模型预期，表明网络编码的紊乱程度较低，功能行为接近单调。

Conclusion: 深度卷积神经网络倾向于表现出比预期更有序的行为，这揭示了一种新的隐含正则化形式，网络功能接近单调性。

Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the
frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural
balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider,
we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models.
From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an
Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of
disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a
functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural
balance) means that the function representing the network behaves
near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the
null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order
determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This
confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a
more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form
of implicit regularization.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种增强的差分隐私优化算法DP-Adam-AC，用于在本地化语言模型上进行安全微调，解决了LLM在消费级设备上运行和敏感数据保护的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs的两个安全关切：1）传统LLM硬件要求使其无法在消费级设备上本地运行，需要远程网络连接易受网络攻击；2）敏感任务的微调涉及敏感数据，非私有微调算法使模型易受训练数据重现攻击。

Method: 引入可适应梯度裁剪和其他工程增强到标准DP-Adam优化器，创建DP-Adam-AC优化器，用于微调两种本地化LLM设计：小语言模型(Qwen2.5-0.5B)和1.58位量化模型(Bitnet-b1.58-2B)。

Result: 通过在两个合成数据集上的实验，展示了在损失方面的有前景的改进。

Conclusion: 通过增强的差分隐私优化算法实现了在本地化语言模型上的安全微调，有效解决了LLM的安全关切问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and
ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire
specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great
utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two
security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make
them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network
connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the
system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a
sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms
produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work
addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private
optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language
models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering
enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our
optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language
model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We
demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two
synthetic datasets.

Abstract: We study the cosine similarity of sentence transformer embeddings and observe
that they are well modeled by gamma mixtures. From a fixed corpus, we measure
similarities between all document embeddings and a reference query embedding.
Empirically we find that these distributions are often well captured by a gamma
distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], and in many cases, by a gamma
mixture. We propose a heuristic model in which a hierarchical clustering of
topics naturally leads to a gamma-mixture structure in the similarity scores.
Finally, we outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted
gamma mixtures, which provides a practical tool for modeling similarity
distributions.

Motivation: 传统对抗训练中使用的MSE正则化强制输出分布过于均匀，限制了鲁棒性提升，需要更灵活的正则化方法。

Method: 提出两种新正则化：1）加权对抗互正则化，使用分解的对抗互KL散度损失，为主目标和辅助目标分配不等权重；2）对抗泛化正则化，在对抗训练目标中引入额外的干净目标分布。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提方法相比现有正则化方法显著提高了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过重新设计正则化策略，特别是使用灵活的KL散度损失和引入干净目标分布，可以有效提升对抗训练的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

Conclusion: TRNN成功融合了张量回归的几何保持特性和神经网络的非线性表达能力，为高维张量数据分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous,
high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose
natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires
regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough
to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial
and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first
requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural
networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial
structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a
Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two
paradigms.

TL;DR: MADPO提出了一种基于边距自适应加权的DPO改进方法，通过训练奖励模型估计偏好边距，为每个训练样本应用连续自适应权重，有效解决固定温度参数导致的过拟合和学习不足问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统DPO方法使用固定温度参数，在处理多样化偏好数据时会导致对简单样本过拟合、对信息丰富样本学习不足的问题。现有改进方法如IPO和β-DPO各有局限性。

Method: 采用两步法：先训练奖励模型估计偏好边距，然后使用这些边距为每个训练样本应用连续自适应权重到DPO损失函数中，对困难样本放大学习信号，对简单样本抑制学习信号。

Result: 在情感生成任务中，MADPO在所有基线方法中表现最佳，在高质量数据上性能提升达33.3%，在低质量数据上提升10.5%。

Conclusion: MADPO为偏好对齐提供了一种更稳健和原则性的方法，具有良好优化的理论保证和对奖励模型估计误差的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed
temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,
causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.
Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general
overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more
targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its
batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to
mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative
$\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful
training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference
Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and
instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first
trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these
margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each
individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective
target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,
allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a
comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved
optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We
validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where
MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across
datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on
High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.
Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to
preference alignment.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖迭代数值方法解决NLFFF问题，需要开发能够直接从边界条件学习3D磁场结构的新方法，同时确保预测结果符合物理规律。

Method: 结合高效通道注意力机制和空洞卷积来增强模型捕捉多模态输入的能力，并在训练过程中通过强制执行无力场和无散度条件来应用物理信息损失。

Result: 在ISEE NLFFF数据集上的实验表明，PIANO在精度上优于最先进的神经算子，并且在各种太阳活动区域重建的磁场中显示出与NLFFF数据物理特性的强一致性。

Abstract: We propose Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator
(PIANO) to solve the Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) problem in solar
physics. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on iterative numerical
methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure
from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel
Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the
model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels
relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply
physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free
conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with
underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF
dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural
operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the
physical characteristics of NLFFF data across magnetic fields reconstructed
from various solar active regions. The GitHub of this project is available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MT-DAO是一种多时间尺度优化器，通过使用多个快慢动量来解决分布式训练中不频繁通信导致的性能下降问题，在保持通信效率的同时消除与同步DDP的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式数据并行训练中频繁的梯度通信会饱和带宽，而不频繁通信策略（如Local SGD）在应用于自适应优化器时存在性能差距，这是由于优化器的快速动量与长更新间隔不匹配导致的。

Method: 提出MT-DAO优化器家族，采用多个快慢移动的一阶动量或梯度来跟踪不同时间尺度的更新动态，并提供了首个收敛性保证。

Result: 在语言模型预训练中，MT-DAO消除了与DDP的性能差距，在困惑度上优于不频繁通信基线，在以太网互连上将等token训练时间减少6-27%。在720M规模上，达到目标困惑度所需的步骤减少24%，时间减少35%。

Conclusion: MT-DAO实现了有效的跨数据中心训练和广域地理范围内的训练，解决了不频繁通信策略在自适应优化器中的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) requires
frequent communication of gradients across workers, which can saturate
bandwidth. Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this
overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance
gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale
mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,
decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to
noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of
optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the
gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we
provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model
pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming
infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token
wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO
reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the
single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter
training and training over wide geographic areas.

TL;DR: KVLinC是一个通过Hadamard旋转和线性校正适配器来减轻KV缓存量化误差的框架，在极低精度下保持生成质量的同时实现更高的KV缓存压缩和更快的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存量化是提高大语言模型推理效率的有效策略，但激进量化到极低精度（如2位）会引入显著误差，通过注意力机制传播并降低生成质量。

Method: 结合Hadamard旋转（减少值量化误差）和轻量级线性校正适配器（补偿量化键引入的误差），并实现自定义注意力内核。

Result: 在LLaMA、Qwen2.5和Qwen3模型系列上的广泛评估显示，KVLinC始终匹配或超越强基线，同时实现更高的KV缓存压缩，推理速度比Flash Attention基线快达2.55倍。

Conclusion: KVLinC能够有效缓解极低精度KV缓存量化引入的注意力误差，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升推理效率和长上下文处理能力。

Abstract: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the
inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive
quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors
in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product
attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this,
we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV
cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a
Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight
linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by
quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3
model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while
achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom
attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash
Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

Conclusion: S-Pformer通过消除编码器冗余和集成傅里叶特征嵌入，成功解决了PINNSformer的参数效率和频谱偏差问题，为基于Transformer的PINN架构提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for
approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning
methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a
Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer
(S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two
key issues; 1. the redundancy (i.e. increased parameter count) of the encoder,
and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary
for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on
self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier
feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive
encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms
encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or
outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient temperature prediction is critical for optimizing the
preheating process of PET preforms in industrial microwave systems prior to
blow molding. We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized
temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive
retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a
data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model
fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural
regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or
varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified
global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics
across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to
enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for
large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to
models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies
material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant
improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for
intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the
approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to
other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited

Motivation: 太阳质子事件对卫星、宇航员和技术系统造成严重辐射危害，准确预测其质子通量时间剖面对于早期预警和缓解措施至关重要。

Method: 使用40个SPE事件数据集，基于LSTM的seq2seq模型，通过4折分层交叉验证评估不同配置：质子输入vs质子+X射线输入、原始数据vs趋势平滑数据、自回归vs一次性预测。

Result: 一次性预测误差低于自回归预测；原始数据下质子模型优于质子+X射线模型，但趋势平滑后差距缩小或反转；趋势平滑显著提升质子+X射线模型性能；趋势平滑数据训练模型平均表现最佳，但最佳模型来自原始数据训练。

Conclusion: LSTM seq2seq模型能有效预测SPE质子通量，一次性预测策略和适当的数据预处理能提升预测精度，但模型架构选择有时比数据预处理更重要。

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites,
astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton
flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper
explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long
Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following
SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by
NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and
undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we
evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding
dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.
combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,
and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as
follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than
autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative
approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform
proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or
reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances
the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray
channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on
average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting
that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data
preprocessing.

Conclusion: NoiseCurve通过模型曲率改进噪声关联，有效提高了差分隐私训练的准确性。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) offers the
promise of training deep learning models while mitigating many privacy risks.
However, there is currently a large accuracy gap between DP-SGD and normal SGD
training. This has resulted in different lines of research investigating
orthogonal ways of improving privacy-preserving training. One such line of
work, known as DP-MF, correlates the privacy noise across different iterations
of stochastic gradient descent -- allowing later iterations to cancel out some
of the noise added to earlier iterations. In this paper, we study how to
improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that
uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the
quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various
datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations
computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in
accuracy over the correlation scheme used by DP-MF.

multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems
require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise
data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We
introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware
self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online
learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during
generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision
signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL}
schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds
reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving
lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$
wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of
magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms
KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware}
self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal
training overhead.

TL;DR: 本文综述了物理信息机器学习（PIML）在生物医学领域的应用，重点介绍了三种主要框架：物理信息神经网络（PINNs）、神经常微分方程（NODEs）和神经算子（NOs），并讨论了该领域面临的挑战和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒学习方法在物理可解释性、数据稀缺或系统复杂性方面存在不足，PIML通过整合参数化物理定律与数据驱动方法，为复杂生物医学系统建模提供了变革性范式。

Result: PIML已在生物固体和生物流体力学、力学生物学、医学成像、动态生理系统、药代动力学和细胞信号传导等多个生物医学领域成功应用，能够处理传统方法难以解决的复杂问题。

Conclusion: PIML在生物医学科学和工程中具有广阔前景，但需要解决不确定性量化、泛化能力以及PIML与大型语言模型集成等开放挑战。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially
transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating
parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three
main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),
highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin
with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have
been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,
and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer
continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,
pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful
tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient
simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.
Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data
scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning
insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions
for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of
uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large
language models.

TL;DR: ARLAS框架通过对抗性强化学习训练LLM代理，使其能够防御多样化的间接提示注入攻击，同时提高任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖手工制作的攻击模式数据集，缺乏多样性，使代理容易受到新型提示注入攻击。

Method: 采用基于种群的双玩家零和博弈框架，同时训练攻击者LLM生成多样化提示注入，以及代理LLM学习防御这些攻击并完成任务。

Result: 在BrowserGym和AgentDojo上的评估显示，ARLAS微调的代理攻击成功率显著降低，同时任务成功率提高。

Conclusion: 对抗性过程生成了多样化且具有挑战性的攻击，相比基础模型产生了更鲁棒的代理。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

*Runlin Zhou,Chixiang Chen,Elynn Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种基于Thompson采样的元强化学习算法MTSRL和MTSRL⁺，通过线性价值函数表示和高斯元先验，在任务间共享结构信息，实现了优于独立任务学习的元遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究元强化学习在有限时域MDP中的问题，假设相关任务的最优动作价值函数具有相似结构，旨在通过元学习先验知识来加速新任务的学习过程。

Method: 提出两种Thompson风格算法：MTSRL学习先验均值并使用已知协方差进行后验采样；MTSRL⁺额外估计协方差并采用先验扩展控制有限样本估计误差。还开发了先验对齐技术来保证元遗憾界。

Result: 在已知协方差情况下获得Õ(H⁴S³/²√ANK)元遗憾，学习协方差时获得Õ(H⁴S³/²√AN³K)，当任务数量足够多时优于独立任务学习。仿真实验显示算法能快速跟踪元先知并显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 首次为具有学习Q先验的Thompson风格RL提供了元遗憾保证，为实验丰富的环境提供了实用方法（通过RLSVI预热启动、OLS聚合、协方差扩展）。

Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related
tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions.
Specifically, we posit a linear representation
$Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $
\mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters
$\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two
Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and
performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and
(ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and
employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we
develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the
learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding
meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the
small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is
learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than
prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim
\tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation
environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief
exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially
outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results
give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned
Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation,
covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.

Conclusion: Quantile DeepGR4J框架在径流预测中表现出更好的预测准确性和不确定性量化能力，适合用于洪水预警系统。

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in
modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in
deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models
with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive
performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the
GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a
surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff
prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression
models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding
extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile
regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in
streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify
extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the
model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design
experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the
CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J
framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality
(interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we
carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results
demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出自适应混合位激活量化(AMAQ)方法，通过渐进式压缩激活值和梯度，在协作训练中显著降低通信开销，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模快速增长，协作式服务器-客户端分布式训练面临通信效率和计算开销的挑战，特别是在低资源设备上。

Method: 采用参数高效的分割学习，引入AMAQ策略，基于特征重要性和层级重要性，通过位正则化在通道间分配位预算，将激活值和梯度从高精度(6-8位)逐步压缩到低精度(3-4位)。

Result: 在相同位预算下，AMAQ相比固定精度方法，在LLaMA3 8B和Qwen2.5 7B等模型上实现了约2.5%的生成准确率提升和1.3%的分类准确率提升，显著增强了训练稳定性并减少超低位表示崩溃。

Conclusion: AMAQ在实际多机协作训练中表现优异，以适度的通信开销实现了优越的推理准确率，是低通信成本协作训练的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

TL;DR: 提出了ATOM（原子分子变换算子），一种用于多任务分子动力学的预训练变换器神经算子，通过准等变设计和时间注意力机制实现高效并行解码，在TG80数据集上预训练后展现出优异的零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子动力学模拟方法通常强制严格等变性、依赖顺序展开，限制了灵活性和模拟效率，且多为单任务训练，难以泛化到未见化合物和扩展时间步。

Method: 采用准等变设计（无需显式分子图）和时间注意力机制，允许并行解码多个未来状态；在TG80数据集（包含80种化合物的250万飞秒轨迹）上进行多任务预训练。

Result: 在MD17、RMD17和MD22等基准测试中达到最先进性能；在TG80上多任务预训练后，对不同分子和时间跨度展现出优异的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ATOM代表了向准确、高效和可迁移分子动力学模型迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations underpin modern computational drug dis-
covery, materials science, and biochemistry. Recent machine learning models
provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve
quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional
pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely
on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation
efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual
molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen
compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic
Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural
operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant
design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal
attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple
future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales,
we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over
2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as
MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows
exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time
hori- zons. We believe ATOM represents a significant step toward accurate,
efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics models

TL;DR: 提出了NorMuon优化器，结合正交化和神经元级自适应学习率，解决了Muon优化器中神经元更新不平衡的问题，在大规模语言模型训练中显著提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器通过正交化参数更新改善了优化几何条件，但存在神经元更新不平衡的问题。目前尚未系统探索如何结合Muon和Adam优化器的优势。

Method: 开发了NorMuon优化器，维护每个神经元的二阶动量统计，在正交化后应用行归一化，确保参数平衡利用。在FSDP2框架下实现了高效的分布式实现。

Result: 在多个模型规模上的实验表明，NorMuon持续优于Adam和Muon，在11亿参数预训练设置中比Adam效率提升21.74%，比Muon提升11.31%，同时保持与Muon相当的内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交化和自适应学习率是互补而非竞争的方法，为大规模深度学习中的优化器设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

TL;DR: 提出MIDT-ECG方法，通过时间-频率域监督和多模态人口统计条件化，解决了现有ECG生成方法形态保真度不足和无法生成个性化信号的问题，在隐私保护和临床实用性方面取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在心脏护理中的应用因患者心电图数据的隐私限制而受阻，现有生成式AI方法在可信度和临床实用性方面存在不足，特别是在形态保真度和个性化生成方面。

Method: 基于条件扩散的结构化状态空间模型(SSSD-ECG)，提出MIDT-ECG训练范式，使用时间-频率域监督来增强生理结构真实性，并结合多模态人口统计条件化实现患者特异性合成。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上评估显示，MIDT-ECG显著改善形态一致性，隐私保护指标比基线提高4-8%，导联间相关性误差平均减少74%，在低数据场景下，使用合成ECG训练的分类器性能接近仅使用真实数据的分类器。

Conclusion: 采用时间-频率结构正则化训练的ECG合成器可以作为个性化、高保真、隐私保护的替代方案，在真实数据稀缺时推动生成式AI在医疗领域的负责任使用。

Abstract: The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by
privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of
existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in
trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major
shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological
fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific
physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional
diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled
innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a
novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce
physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning
to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,
clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG
achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves
strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by
4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,
while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and
personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets
supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a
classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG
synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural
regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,
privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the
responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

Motivation: 尽管等变图神经网络在材料科学中表现出强大的经验性能，但其在周期性、对称性约束设置下的表达能力仍未被充分理解。

Method: 分析EGNN层在节点特征、原子坐标和晶格矩阵上的计算，证明在多项式精度、嵌入宽度d=O(n)、O(1)层和O(1)深度、O(n)宽度MLP实现下，这些模型可由均匀TC^0阈值电路族模拟。

Result: EGNNs可被置于TC^0复杂度类中，这为在现实资源约束下此类架构可解决的决策和预测问题设定了具体上限。

Conclusion: 该分析为晶体系统上的对称感知图学习提供了复杂性理论基础，并阐明了需要哪些架构修改（如增加深度、更丰富的几何基元或更宽的层）来超越TC^0机制。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on
relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as
a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their
ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions.
Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic,
symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work
characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for
crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze
the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic
coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision,
embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth,
$O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these
models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family
of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs
within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and
prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource
constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased
depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend
this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do
not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic
foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医院疼痛评估主要依赖患者自述或非特异性心电图生命体征，这使危重、镇静和认知障碍患者面临疼痛治疗不足和过度使用阿片类药物的风险。EEG技术可作为一种辅助工具来检测伤害性处理过程。

Method: 研究比较了机器学习模型对高疼痛与低/无疼痛EEG时段的分类能力。使用52名健康成年人在三种激光诱发疼痛强度下的EEG数据，将每个4秒时段转换为537个特征向量，涵盖频谱功率、频带比率、Hjorth参数、熵测量、相干性、小波能量和峰值频率指标。

Result: 支持向量机(RBF核)在离线测试中表现最佳，达到88.9%准确率和亚毫秒推理时间(1.02ms)。特征重要性分析与当前经典疼痛生理学一致，显示对侧α抑制、中线θ/α增强和额叶γ爆发。实时XGBoost模型保持约4ms端到端延迟和94.2%准确率。

Conclusion: 基于EEG的疼痛监测器在技术上是可行的，为临床验证提供了途径，有望改善危重和无法自述疼痛患者的疼痛管理。

Abstract: Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or
non-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and
cognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid
overuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring
brain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive
tool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In
this study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain
versus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed
to laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second
epoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band
ratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and
peak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated
with leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with
radial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9%
accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance
analysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing
contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal
gamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of
about 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is
technically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards
clinical validation.

Motivation: 现有的RLHF和DPO方法存在三个主要问题：偏好数据污染、奖励过优化和冗长性偏差，大多数工作只解决其中一个问题，且缺乏理论保证。

Method: 提出了RLHF-COV和DPO-COV算法，通过长度正则化处理冗长性偏差，在污染数据上训练时仍能保持泛化能力，且DPO-COV无需奖励估计，实现简单。

Conclusion: RLHF-COV和DPO-COV能同时解决三个关键问题，具有理论保证和实际有效性，且证明了RLHF与DPO算法的等价性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models
(LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is
seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward
\textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards
\textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only
one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation
to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of
generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and
DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three
issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically
demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our
DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates
for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover,
our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is
proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the
equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and
online settings.

Conclusion: GTRANS是一个有效的迁移学习框架，能够通过结构对齐和自适应去偏机制在小规模网络中获得更准确的图函数估计。

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating
latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream
applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate
graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one
often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this
issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve
estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a
larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely
GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing
and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural
patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an
adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific
deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness
of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through
extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate
directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph
classification task and the link prediction task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARMOR是一种新颖的一次性后训练剪枝算法，通过矩阵分解将权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个低开销的块对角矩阵包装器，在保持2:4剪枝推理加速和内存减少的同时，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署面临巨大计算和内存需求挑战，现有半结构化剪枝方法（特别是2:4稀疏性）往往导致显著的性能下降，需要更有效的模型压缩方法。

Method: ARMOR将每个权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个块对角矩阵包装器，这些包装器作为高效的预和后变换误差校正器。通过块坐标下降算法选择稀疏核心和块对角包装器，最小化层间代理损失。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型系列上的实验表明，ARMOR在各种下游任务和困惑度评估中始终显著优于最先进的2:4剪枝方法，同时保持推理加速和内存使用减少。

Conclusion: ARMOR在模型压缩和任务准确性之间建立了更有效的权衡，理论上保证优化收敛到代理损失小于或等于最先进剪枝算法的解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense computational and memory requirements. While semi-structured
pruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware
acceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation.
To bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with
Matrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm.
Instead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a
2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These
wrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors,
offering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional
2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen
through a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy
loss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a
solution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning
algorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and
Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide
range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves this
superior performance while retaining the inference speedups and substantial
memory usage reductions of 2:4 pruning, establishing a more effective trade-off
between model compression and task accuracy

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LATTA是一种新的测试时自适应方法，通过噪声权重扰动和稳定权重锚机制，在保持稳定性的同时有效适应分布偏移，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法（如Tent）存在不稳定性和灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在小批量或挑战性损坏情况下，这源于在复杂损失表面上过于确定性的更新。

Method: 提出LATTA方法，结合两种关键机制：(1)受随机梯度Langevin动力学启发的噪声权重扰动，探索局部参数空间并逃离不良局部最小值；(2)稳定权重锚，防止模型偏离其鲁棒的源预训练。

Result: 在标准基准测试（包括Rotated-MNIST和更具挑战性的CIFAR-10-C）上，LATTA显著优于现有方法（Tent、CoTTA、EATA），在CIFAR-10-C上平均准确率提高超过2%，同时降低性能方差。

Conclusion: LATTA为自监督测试时自适应设定了新的最先进水平，无需架构更改或昂贵的蒙特卡洛传递，就能有效适应分布偏移而不会牺牲稳定性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pretrained model to distribution
shifts using only unlabeled test data. While promising, existing methods like
Tent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source
knowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We
argue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss
surface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation
(LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key
mechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor
local minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from
diverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to
adapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA
methods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo
passes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including
Rotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that
LATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and
EATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving
average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing
performance variance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦特征选择框架，通过隐私保护的知识融合和样本感知加权策略，解决分布式场景中的数据不平衡、异构性和隐私限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征选择方法难以捕捉复杂特征交互，且无法适应分布式场景中的数据不平衡、异构性和隐私限制。需要开发能够在保护隐私的前提下整合各客户端特征选择知识的框架。

Method: 1) 开发隐私保护的知识融合策略，在不共享敏感原始数据的情况下获得统一表示空间；2) 引入样本感知加权策略，处理异构本地客户端间的分布不平衡问题。

Result: 大量实验验证了该框架的有效性、鲁棒性和效率，在联邦学习场景中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了分布式特征选择中的隐私保护和数据异构性问题，为联邦学习场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature selection eliminates redundancy among features to improve downstream
task performance while reducing computational overhead. Existing methods often
struggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse
application scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to
alleviate these drawbacks. However, these methods remain constrained by
permutation sensitivity in embedding and reliance on convexity assumptions in
gradient-based search. To address these limitations, our initial work
introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding
with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to
adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local
clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy
regulations, limiting direct sharing. These challenges highlight the need for a
framework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without
exposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance
the framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving
knowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without
sharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy
to address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of
our framework. The results further demonstrate its strong generalization
ability in federated learning scenarios. The code and data are publicly
available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FedCAPS-08BF.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了注意力机制在长上下文中的崩溃问题，发现注意力缩放存在相变现象，并确定了临界缩放因子β_n ∝ log n，为YaRN和Qwen中的注意力缩放提供了理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型处理更长的上下文，注意力层出现注意力分数趋于均匀化的病理现象，导致token过度聚集（rank-collapse）。虽然注意力缩放通过多对数因子β_n重新缩放注意力分数来缓解这一问题，但缺乏理论支持。

Method: 分析了一个简化但可处理的模型，该模型放大了注意力缩放的效果。在该模型中，注意力表现出由缩放因子β_n控制的相变现象。

Result: 发现注意力缩放存在相变：缩放不足会导致所有token坍缩到单一方向，而过度缩放则使注意力退化为恒等变换，消除token间的有意义的交互。主要结果是确定了临界缩放β_n ∝ log n。

Conclusion: 为YaRN和Qwen中的注意力缩放提供了严格的理论依据，阐明了为什么对数缩放能在长上下文中保持稀疏、内容自适应的注意力机制。

Abstract: As large language models scale to longer contexts, attention layers suffer
from a fundamental pathology: attention scores collapse toward uniformity as
context length $n$ increases, causing tokens to cluster excessively, a
phenomenon known as rank-collapse. While $\textit{attention scaling}$
effectively addresses this deficiency by rescaling attention scores with a
polylogarithmic factor $\beta_n$, theoretical justification for this approach
remains lacking.
  We analyze a simplified yet tractable model that magnifies the effect of
attention scaling. In this model, attention exhibits a phase transition
governed by the scaling factor $\beta_n$: insufficient scaling collapses all
tokens to a single direction, while excessive scaling reduces attention to
identity, thereby eliminating meaningful interactions between tokens. Our main
result identifies the critical scaling $\beta_n \asymp \log n$ and provides a
rigorous justification for attention scaling in YaRN and Qwen, clarifying why
logarithmic scaling maintains sparse, content-adaptive attention at large
context lengths.

Conclusion: GDGM框架能够有效捕捉动态交易模式和市场条件变化，为合谋欺骗检测提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for
identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional
machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often
overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based
techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field
by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world
spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular
patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some
scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving
inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models
dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn
representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach
incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal
patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted
into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural
ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the
representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns.
Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques
are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection
performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on
spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing
detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global
trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance
of the proposed method.

Motivation: 现实应用中许多图是时序演化的，但现有图生成器主要关注静态图，忽略了时序信息。现有基于学习的方法存在训练效率低或生成速度慢的问题。

Method: 提出时序图自编码器(TGAE)，使用基于注意力的图编码器在采样的自我图上编码时序和结构特征，并设计自我图解码器实现高效的时序图生成。

Result: 在真实和合成时序图上的实验表明，TGAE在模拟质量和效率方面优于最先进的时序图生成器。

Conclusion: TGAE方法能够有效模拟时序图的结构和时序特性，在质量和效率上均表现出色。

Abstract: Graph simulation has recently received a surge of attention in graph
processing and analytics. In real-life applications, e.g. social science,
biology, and chemistry, many graphs are composed of a series of evolving graphs
(i.e., temporal graphs). While most of the existing graph generators focus on
static graphs, the temporal information of the graphs is ignored. In this
paper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the
structural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs.
In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph
generators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these
learning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in
training or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods.
Therefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph
snapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose
an attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural
characteristics on sampled ego-graphs. And we proposed an ego-graph decoder
that can achieve a good trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency in
temporal graph generation. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted
among our proposed TGAE and representative temporal graph generators on
real-life temporal graphs and synthesized graphs. It is reported that our
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal graph generators by
means of simulation quality and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协作学习共享模型权重存在效率问题，而基于嵌入共享的方法缺乏差分隐私保护机制，需要开发既能保护隐私又高效的协作学习方案。

Method: 设计隐私编码网络和效用生成网络，生成具有正式差分隐私保证的嵌入向量，服务器端学习后处理以提高机器学习任务准确率。

Result: 该方法仅需一轮私有通信，客户端计算量少于传统方法，生成的私有化嵌入与服务器端模型类型无关。

Conclusion: 通过协作学习和隐私学习的协同设计，实现了高效且具有隐私保护的嵌入共享方案，适用于各种服务器端模型。

Abstract: Traditional collaborative learning approaches are based on sharing of model
weights between clients and a server. However, there are advantages to resource
efficiency through schemes based on sharing of embeddings (activations) created
from the data. Several differentially private methods were developed for
sharing of weights while such mechanisms do not exist so far for sharing of
embeddings. We propose Ours to learn a privacy encoding network in conjunction
with a small utility generation network such that the final embeddings
generated from it are equipped with formal differential privacy guarantees.
These privatized embeddings are then shared with a more powerful server, that
learns a post-processing that results in a higher accuracy for machine learning
tasks. We show that our co-design of collaborative and private learning results
in requiring only one round of privatized communication and lesser compute on
the client than traditional methods. The privatized embeddings that we share
from the client are agnostic to the type of model (deep learning, random
forests or XGBoost) used on the server in order to process these activations to
complete a task.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练过程中会记忆训练数据，导致严重的隐私泄露风险，需要更有效的隐私风险评估方法。

Method: 提出InfoRMIA信息论成员推理攻击框架，并在token级别分析记忆泄露，实现从序列级到token级的精确泄露定位。

Result: InfoRMIA在基准测试中一致优于现有方法RMIA，计算效率更高，token级分析能精确定位被记忆的token。

Conclusion: InfoRMIA为LLM隐私风险评估提供了更有效的工具，token级分析重新定义了隐私泄露的评估方式，可实现更精准的隐私保护措施。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they
inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large
language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which
amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy
risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the
release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership
inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership
Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled
information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method
consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved
computational efficiency.
  In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating
sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage.
We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs:
token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA
can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby
localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while
achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope
rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as
exact unlearning.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly
experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds
at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing
to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more
traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range
interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention
mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global
attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to
inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce
the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN -
that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN
with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global
attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven
diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and
classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message
passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study
shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused
local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by
long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute
trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these
results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in
atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model
development.

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series
across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a
variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of
source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a
pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time
series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection
regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time
series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models
(LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities.
Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch
invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and
gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2)
lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates
systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally
aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the
proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.

Conclusion: 复杂吸引盆结构对深度学习训练的可预测性和可重复性施加了根本限制，这对优化和AI安全部署具有重要意义

Abstract: Fundamental limits to predictability are central to our understanding of many
physical and computational systems. Here we show that, despite its remarkable
capabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the
fractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that
leads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a
different one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled
basins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning,
including chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces,
to reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting
basins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure
characterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large
increases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in
outcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the
predictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing
a unified account of many empirical observations. These results reveal a
general organizing principle of deep learning with important implications for
optimization and the safe deployment of artificial intelligence.

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for
learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations
(PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the
associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier
Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume
translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is
represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling
is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design
enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on
fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an
interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further
enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO
achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also
provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a
bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds
in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond
one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type
integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for
continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to
spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such
as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).

require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

### [135] [Quantifying the Accuracy-Interpretability Trade-Off in Concept-Based Sidechannel Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05670)
*David Debot,Giuseppe Marra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS)和SIS正则化方法，用于量化并控制概念侧信道模型在准确性和可解释性之间的权衡，通过惩罚对侧信道的依赖来提高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念瓶颈模型(CBNMs)通过概念瓶颈层提供可解释性，但限制了信息流导致准确性下降。概念侧信道模型(CSMs)通过侧信道提高准确性，但牺牲了可解释性。目前缺乏控制这种权衡的原则性方法。

Method: 提出了统一概率概念侧信道元模型，引入Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS)量化侧信道依赖度，并提出SIS正则化方法惩罚侧信道依赖。分析了预测器表达能力与侧信道依赖度如何共同影响可解释性。

Result: 实证结果显示，仅以准确性为目标训练的最先进CSMs表现出较低的可解释性，而SIS正则化显著提高了它们的可解释性、可干预性以及学习到的可解释任务预测器的质量。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发在准确性和可解释性之间取得平衡的CSMs提供了理论和实践工具，实现了对这种基本权衡的原则性控制。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide
interpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based
exclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also
restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.
Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a
sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant
information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises
interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations
transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled
technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this
gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model
that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we
introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a
CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and
without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which
explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,
we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the
sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs
across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that
state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low
representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially
improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned
interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical
tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a
principled manner.

*Félix Vandervorst,Bruno Deprez,Wouter Verbeke,Tim Verdonck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的归纳图梯度提升机（G-GBM），用于异构动态图上的监督学习，在保险欺诈检测任务中表现优异，并能提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈检测面临图方法难以处理高类别不平衡、异构动态网络等挑战，而基于表格数据的梯度提升树方法仍占主导地位，因此需要开发能结合图结构和梯度提升优势的新方法。

Method: 开发了归纳图梯度提升机（G-GBM），将梯度提升森林作为主干模型，结合图神经网络方法处理异构动态图，并应用可解释性方法来理解模型预测。

Result: G-GBM在模拟随机图实验中与流行的图神经网络方法竞争，在开源和真实专有数据集上展示了强大的保险欺诈检测能力。

Conclusion: G-GBM为异构动态图上的监督学习提供了有效的解决方案，在保险欺诈检测等应用中表现出色，同时保持了梯度提升模型的可解释性优势。

Abstract: Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due
to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a
prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals
that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple
policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find
meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance
present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and
dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies.
That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the
field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine
(G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show
that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an
experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power
of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world,
proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting
forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights
into the predictions made by G-GBM.

TL;DR: 提出了QuantumGraphLIME（QGraphLIME），一个模型无关的后处理框架，用于解释量子图神经网络，通过聚合局部代理模型的归因及其离散度来提供不确定性感知的节点和边重要性排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子图神经网络在图结构数据学习方面具有强大能力，但其可解释性受到测量诱导的随机性和图结构组合性质的复杂化影响，需要开发专门的可解释性方法。

Method: 将模型解释视为在结构保持的图扰动上拟合的局部代理模型的分布，通过聚合代理归因及其离散度来获得不确定性感知的重要性排序，并提供基于Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz界限的有限样本保证。

Result: 在具有已知真实值的受控合成图上的实证研究表明，该方法能够提供准确稳定的解释，消融实验显示了非线性代理建模的明显优势和对扰动设计的敏感性。

Conclusion: 建立了一个原则性的、不确定性感知的、结构敏感的方法来解释量子图神经网络，为扩展到更广泛的架构和真实世界数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on
graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by
measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph
structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a
model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as
distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations
of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their
dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance
rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a
distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate
ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of
the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and
confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on
controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and
stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear
surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design.
Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and
structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and
lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world
datasets, as quantum resources mature. Code is available at

### [138] [vAttention: Verified Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05688)
*Aditya Desai,Kumar Krishna Agrawal,Shuo Yang,Alejandro Cuadron,Luis Gaspar Schroeder,Matei Zaharia,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: vAttention是一种结合top-k和随机采样的稀疏注意力机制，提供用户指定的(ε, δ)精度保证，在保持模型质量的同时实现高达20倍的稀疏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏注意力方法（top-k和采样）在近似全注意力方面存在根本限制：无法提供跨头和查询向量的一致近似，且缺乏近似质量保证，限制了实际部署。

Method: 结合top-k和随机采样的互补优势：top-k在注意力分数由少数token主导时表现良好，而随机采样在注意力分数相对均匀时提供更好估计。利用采样的统计保证，开发具有(ε, δ)精度保证的vAttention机制。

Result: vAttention显著提升稀疏注意力质量（Llama-3.1-8B-Inst和Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B在RULER-HARD上提升约4.5个百分点），在高达20倍稀疏度下匹配全模型质量，在推理场景中实现快速解码而不影响模型质量。

Conclusion: vAttention是第一个具有用户指定精度保证的实用稀疏注意力机制，为大规模稀疏注意力的可靠部署迈出了重要一步，提供了优越的质量-效率权衡。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall
into two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and
recently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are
fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail
to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most
critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical
deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:
top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,
whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are
relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical
guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse
attention mechanism with user-specified $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees on
approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a
compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at
scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both
individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our
experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse
attention (e.g., $\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and
Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap
between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model
quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in
reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality
(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with
up to 32K token generations). Code is open-sourced at

### [139] [Primal-Dual Direct Preference Optimization for Constrained LLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05703)
*Yihan Du,Seo Taek Kong,R. Srikant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的原始-对偶DPO方法，用于在LLMs中实现约束对齐，即在最大化输出奖励的同时限制不安全内容的成本低于阈值。该方法显著降低了内存和计算成本，且无需额外先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs安全对齐方法要么需要训练奖励和成本模型并产生高内存和计算成本，要么需要关于最优解的先验知识。因此需要一种更高效且无需额外知识的约束对齐方法。

Method: 首先在奖励偏好数据上使用标准DPO训练模型以提供奖励信息，然后采用重排的拉格朗日DPO目标利用提供的奖励信息在成本偏好数据上微调LLMs。还扩展到在线数据设置，通过加入探索奖励来探索未覆盖的提示-响应空间。

Result: 在广泛使用的偏好数据集PKU-SafeRLHF上的实验结果表明该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs的约束对齐提供了一种高效且理论保证的解决方案，显著降低了资源需求并消除了对先验知识的依赖。

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing
demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and
avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been
several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either
require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and
computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution.
Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs,
i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to
potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we
propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using
standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then
adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward
information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach
significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require
extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees
on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also
extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration
bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space,
and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on
preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference
dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VAE和GAN的序列解缠方法依赖多个损失项，优化复杂，且在真实世界数据上表现不佳，缺乏标准评估协议。扩散模型作为先进生成模型，尚未在序列解缠领域得到理论形式化。

Method: DiffSDA采用概率建模、潜在扩散和高效采样器，构建模态无关的框架，适用于时间序列、视频和音频等多种数据。

Result: 在多个真实世界基准测试中，DiffSDA在序列解缠任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DiffSDA为序列解缠提供了有效的扩散模型解决方案，建立了严格的评估协议，并在多种数据模态上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning, particularly sequential
disentanglement, aims to separate static and dynamic factors of variation in
data without relying on labels. This remains a challenging problem, as existing
approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial
networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization
process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when
applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation
protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion
models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical
formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In
this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder
(DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse
real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA
leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient
samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous
testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential
disentanglement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在模式挖掘的邻域自适应广义线性图嵌入模型(NGLGE)，通过自适应图学习和低秩表示重构，有效揭示数据内在相关性并灵活探索额外模式信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图构建方法需要预先定义邻域大小，限制了数据潜在结构相关性的有效揭示；同时使用线性投影的图嵌入方法依赖单一模式挖掘，在不同场景下的适应性相对较弱。

Method: 提出NGLGE模型，引入针对邻域的自适应图学习方法，利用重构的低秩表示并对投影矩阵施加ℓ₂,₀范数约束，以灵活探索额外模式信息，并推导了高效迭代求解算法。

Result: 在多种场景的数据集上进行对比评估，证明该模型相比最先进方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: NGLGE模型通过自适应图学习和模式挖掘，有效解决了传统图嵌入方法的局限性，在不同场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种学习型调度器来替代传统的基于规则的调度策略，用于掩码扩散模型中的去噪过程，通过KL正则化马尔可夫决策过程优化解掩码顺序，在多个基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型在语言建模中性能高度依赖于解掩码顺序的选择，传统基于规则的调度策略（如最大置信度、最大边距）只能提供临时改进，需要更智能的调度方法。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为KL正则化马尔可夫决策过程，使用显式参考策略，优化具有策略改进和收敛保证的正则化目标函数，学习最优的解掩码策略。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，学习型策略始终优于最大置信度方法，特别是在SUDOKU任务上，相比随机策略提升20.1%，相比最大置信度策略提升11.2%。

Conclusion: 学习型调度器能够生成更接近数据分布的样本，证明了在掩码扩散模型中学习解掩码顺序的重要性，为语言建模提供了更有效的生成策略。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

Method: 在4人猎鹿博弈中测试"廉价谈话"通信通道，在迭代公共物品惩罚游戏中实施渐进复杂游戏的教学课程。

Result: 通信显著提升合作率（0%→48.3%），而课程学习导致收益下降27.4%，并可能引发"习得性悲观"。

Conclusion: 对于协调问题，简单通信协议比课程学习更可靠；社会困境的课程设计需要仔细考虑游戏序列中嵌入的战略教训。

Abstract: Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI
alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum
learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases
cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust
coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly
sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively
complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game
with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing
defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These
findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols
may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design
for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons
embedded in game sequences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过因果分析框架系统评估了异质图神经网络(HGNNs)的有效性，发现模型架构对性能没有因果影响，而异质信息通过增加同质性和局部-全局分布差异来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多隐含假设HGNNs的有效性，但缺乏对其内在有效性的系统检验，需要从模型架构和异质信息两个角度深入分析HGNNs的真实效果。

Method: 在21个数据集和20个基线模型上进行系统复现和超参数重调，开发因果效应估计框架，通过事实和反事实分析评估候选因素，并使用最小充分调整集、跨方法一致性检验和敏感性分析验证鲁棒性。

Result: 模型架构和复杂度对性能没有因果影响；异质信息通过增加同质性和局部-全局分布差异产生正向因果效应，使节点类别更易区分。

Conclusion: HGNNs的性能提升主要源于异质信息而非模型架构，这为未来异质图学习研究提供了重要指导，应更关注信息质量而非模型复杂性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node
classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks
(HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage
heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly,
aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However,
whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most
studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this
work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and
heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21
datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter
retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a
causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate
factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses,
with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method
consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two
conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on
performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect
by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes
node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/YXNTU/CausalHGNN.

TL;DR: 该论文比较了迁移学习场景下多种成员推理攻击(MIA)的性能，发现攻击效果随训练数据增加而降低，且没有单一MIA能捕获所有隐私风险。LiRA在大多数情况下表现最佳，而IHA在高数据量下对PatchCamelyon数据集更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型的出现，训练范式从零开始训练转向迁移学习，这使得使用敏感应用中的小规模领域特定数据集进行高效训练成为可能。然而，之前对迁移学习微调模型的成员推理攻击评估仅依赖于少量可能的攻击方法。

Method: 在迁移学习设置下比较多种成员推理攻击的性能，包括基于分数的MIA、似然比攻击(LiRA)和逆Hessian攻击(IHA)等，帮助从业者识别最有效的隐私风险评估攻击方法。

Result: 攻击效果随着训练数据的增加而降低；没有单一的MIA能够捕获迁移学习训练模型中的所有隐私风险；LiRA在大多数实验场景中表现最优，而IHA在PatchCamelyon数据集的高数据量情况下更有效。

Conclusion: 迁移学习场景下的隐私风险评估需要采用多种攻击方法，因为不同攻击在不同条件下具有不同的有效性。LiRA通常是最佳选择，但在特定情况下IHA可能更有效。

Abstract: With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training
paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer
learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific
datasets typical in sensitive applications.Membership inference attacks (MIAs)
provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning
models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer
learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by
comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help
practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation.
We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for
score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy
risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio
Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental
scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against
models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型(TIHMM)的合成SNP序列数据生成框架，通过限制每个SNP序列在训练中的贡献来提供差分隐私保证，解决了基因组数据共享中的隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNP数据集对遗传研究至关重要，但共享时存在严重的隐私风险，现有隐私保护方法要么对统计摘要应用差分隐私，要么需要复杂的后处理和使用公开数据集。

Method: 使用时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型生成合成SNP序列数据，通过限制每个SNP序列的梯度贡献来确保差分隐私保护，直接处理SNP之间的相关性带来的隐私风险。

Result: 在1000 Genomes数据集上的实验表明，在ε∈[1,10]、δ=10^{-4}的隐私预算下，该方法能有效生成合成数据，特别是通过允许HMM转移模型依赖于序列位置，显著提升了性能，使合成数据能密切复制非私有数据集的统计特性。

Conclusion: 该框架在保护基因组数据隐私的同时，为研究人员提供了出色的灵活性和实用性，促进了基因组数据的私有共享。

Abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic
studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs
with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value
reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing
privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical
summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require
post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or
selectively share SNPs.
  In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic
SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden
Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure
that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training,
enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on
full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method
directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.
  Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\varepsilon
\in [1, 10]$ at $\delta=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of
the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly
enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the
statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the
private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional
flexibility and utility.

Method: 用平滑的低损失参数化替代物（二次贝塞尔曲线）替换完整SGD轨迹，这些曲线连接真实训练轨迹的初始和最终模型状态，提供无噪声、低曲率的监督信号。

Result: 在五个临床数据集上，该方法优于最先进的压缩方法，生成的压缩数据集能够支持临床有效的模型开发。

Conclusion: 贝塞尔模式连接作为SGD路径的有效替代物，能够稳定梯度、加速收敛并消除密集轨迹存储需求，为临床数据访问提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

TL;DR: 提出Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF)方法，通过Entropic Annealing和Look-ahead Modulation技术解决粒子滤波在推理时间缩放中的过早利用问题，显著提升数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统粒子滤波方法在过程奖励模型引导下容易产生过早利用问题，由于早期评分过于自信导致粒子多样性丧失，在计算预算受限时尤其严重。

Method: ePF整合两种新技术：Entropic Annealing通过监控搜索多样性并在多样性下降时动态退火重采样分布来保持探索；Look-ahead Modulation通过评估状态的后续潜力来增强预测指导。

Result: 在多个挑战性数学基准测试中，ePF显著优于强基线方法，任务奖励相对提升高达50%。

Conclusion: ePF通过平衡多样化解空间的探索与高奖励区域的利用，提高了粒子滤波的鲁棒性，最终获得更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

TL;DR: 提出MDTI框架，通过多模态轨迹表示学习整合GPS序列、网格轨迹和道路网络约束，提升旅行时间估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将轨迹转换为固定长度表示，忽略了真实轨迹的可变性，导致信息丢失或特征冗余。

Method: 使用模态特定编码器和跨模态交互模块捕获空间、时间和拓扑语义，动态轨迹建模机制自适应调节不同长度轨迹的信息密度，采用对比对齐和掩码语言建模两种自监督预训练目标。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，MDTI始终优于最先进的基线方法，证实了其鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MDTI框架通过多模态轨迹表示学习有效提升了旅行时间估计的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous
data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches
typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting
the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to
information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a
novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates
GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE
accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction
module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics,
while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information
density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining
objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further
strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong
generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at:

Method: 利用流模型通常的高斯先验分布，在源空间中使用椭圆切片采样进行贝叶斯推断，只需要生成模型和观测过程的前向传递，无需梯度或雅可比计算。

Result: 在材料设计和蛋白质结构预测任务中展示了有效性，能够根据稀疏残基间距离测量预测蛋白质结构。

Conclusion: ESS-Flow为条件生成提供了一种无需梯度的有效方法，特别适用于梯度不可靠或不可用的场景。

Abstract: Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or
to produce samples with desired target properties enables solving diverse tasks
without retraining on paired data. We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method
that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in
flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space
using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through
the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian
computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or
unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the
generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein
structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.

Motivation: 在零售、金融、医疗和推荐系统等领域，预测未来事件分布比精确的时间顺序更重要，需要探索超越自回归范式的方法。

Method: 分析了局部顺序不变性，引入基于KL散度的指标量化时间漂移，比较了显式分布预测与隐式多标记方法的性能。

Result: 简单的显式分布预测目标始终优于复杂的隐式基线方法，预测类别模式崩溃主要由分布不平衡驱动。

Conclusion: 为选择建模策略提供了原则性框架，并为构建更准确和鲁棒的预测系统提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This paper studies forecasting of the future distribution of events in human
action sequences, a task essential in domains like retail, finance, healthcare,
and recommendation systems where the precise temporal order is often less
critical than the set of outcomes. We challenge the dominant autoregressive
paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or
order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We
analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify
temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting
objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further
demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by
distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for
selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more
accurate and robust forecasting systems.

TL;DR: 提出Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO)方法，通过元学习解决图网络模拟器在物理参数变化时需要重新训练的问题，实现对新物理参数的快速适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网格模拟计算昂贵且需物理参数知识，而数据驱动的图网络模拟器虽推理快，但对参数微小变化需重新训练且数据收集成本高。不同参数模拟共享潜在结构，因此需要学习这种共享结构。

Method: 使用条件神经过程(CNPs)编码图轨迹生成潜在表示，并结合新型神经算子架构来减轻时间上的误差累积。

Conclusion: MaNGO通过元学习有效学习共享潜在结构，能够快速适应新的物理参数而无需重新训练，解决了图网络模拟器的关键限制。

Abstract: Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with
applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional
mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive
and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In
contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer
faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be
retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and
secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter
setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often
share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these
challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling
fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we
propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding
graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error
accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator
architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on
several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties,
demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO
achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle
model.

Motivation: 现有GeoAI基准通常专注于单一任务和单一模态，缺乏标准化、多任务、模态无关的基准来系统评估地理空间嵌入器，限制了GeoAI的发展。

Method: 设计了一个模态无关的基准测试，包含来自三大洲7个不同城市的数据集，确保通用性并减少人口统计偏差，同时建立了简单直观的任务导向模型基线。

Conclusion: 该基准填补了GeoAI领域标准化评估的空白，为系统评估地理空间嵌入器提供了重要工具，促进了GeoAI研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: GeoAI is evolving rapidly, fueled by diverse geospatial datasets like traffic
patterns, environmental data, and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) information.
While sophisticated AI models are being developed, existing benchmarks are
often concentrated on single tasks and restricted to a single modality. As
such, progress in GeoAI is limited by the lack of a standardized, multi-task,
modality-agnostic benchmark for their systematic evaluation. This paper
introduces a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance, accuracy, and
efficiency of geospatial embedders. Our benchmark is modality-agnostic and
comprises 7 distinct datasets from diverse cities across three continents,
ensuring generalizability and mitigating demographic biases. It allows for the
evaluation of GeoAI embedders on various phenomena that exhibit underlying
geographic processes. Furthermore, we establish a simple and intuitive
task-oriented model baselines, providing a crucial reference point for
comparing more complex solutions.

TL;DR: 本文发现现有混合线性注意力方法存在关键缺陷，几乎完全依赖滑动窗口softmax而绕过线性组件，提出了三种解决方案来确保组件平衡使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的二次计算复杂度限制了其可扩展性，而现有线性注意力预训练成本高昂，后训练线性化方法存在组件使用不平衡的问题。

Method: 提出了三种方法：(1)推理时混合线性转换与滑动窗口softmax；(2)HedgeCATs结合注意力权重迁移与目标LoRA微调；(3)计划滑动窗口dropout在训练中随机抑制softmax分支。

Result: 方法在保持计算效率的同时恢复了大部分基础模型性能，确保真正的线性注意力采用，恢复了性能归因的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案成功解决了混合线性注意力转换中的组件崩溃问题，实现了计算效率与模型性能的平衡。

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Motivation: 心电图异常检测对于识别心血管疾病相关的偏差至关重要，需要开发有效的无监督异常检测方法。

Method: 使用三种自动编码器架构：卷积自动编码器（CAE）、双向长短期记忆变分自动编码器（VAE-BiLSTM）和带多头注意力的VAE-BiLSTM（VAE-BiLSTM-MHA），在正常ECG样本上进行训练以重建非异常心脏形态。

Result: 在CPSC数据集上，注意力增强的VAE-BiLSTM-MHA架构表现最佳，AUPRC为0.81，召回率为0.85，优于其他架构。

Conclusion: VAE-BiLSTM-MHA架构在ECG异常检测中表现出色，并已集成到交互式仪表板中用于临床分诊可视化。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
identifying deviations associated with cardiovascular disease. This work
presents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures:
convolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional
long short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention
(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of
our knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA
architecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG
samples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations
indicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on
the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the
attention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81
and a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other
architectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated
into an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In
addition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is
provided.

Motivation: 解决深度生成模型中样本质量与记忆化之间的基本权衡问题，避免模型仅复制训练数据而非泛化到潜在数据几何结构。

Method: 将传统流匹配中的均匀各向同性噪声替换为空间变化、各向异性的高斯噪声，其协方差捕捉潜在数据流形的局部几何结构。

Result: 在多种数据集和神经网络架构上的实验表明，CDC-FM始终提供更好的质量-泛化权衡，在数据稀缺和非均匀采样场景下显著优于标准流匹配。

Conclusion: CDC-FM为研究生成模型中数据几何、泛化和记忆化之间的相互作用提供了数学框架，并提供了一个可轻松集成到现有流匹配流程中的鲁棒且可扩展的算法。

Abstract: Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality
can come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data
rather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce
Carr\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching
(FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the
probability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the
homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic
Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data
manifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from
the data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive
experimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds,
single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various
neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate
that CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We
observe significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in
highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for
science applications. Our work provides a mathematical framework for studying
the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in
generative models, as well as a robust and scalable algorithm that can be
readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.

Motivation: 高维数据在机器学习中普遍存在，影响模型可解释性和计算效率。现有LLM特征选择方法缺乏结构化推理和透明决策依据。

Method: 提出LLM-FS-Agent多智能体架构，让多个LLM智能体扮演不同角色进行集体辩论，共同评估特征相关性并生成详细解释。

Conclusion: 该审议架构提高了决策透明度和计算效率，使LLM-FS-Agent成为实际应用的实用可靠解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning,
often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction
through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack
structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This
paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for
interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a
deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,
enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed
justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the
CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance
against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as
PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves
superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream
training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =
0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative
architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,
establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: JEPA-SCORE方法揭示了联合嵌入预测架构(JEPAs)中的抗坍缩项实际上是在估计数据密度，使得训练好的JEPA模型可以直接用于计算样本概率，应用于数据筛选、异常检测和密度估计等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上认为JEPAs中的抗坍缩项只是防止表征坍缩的简单方法，但本文发现该功能实际上在估计数据密度，这为JEPAs模型提供了新的应用价值。

Method: 通过理论分析证明JEPAs的抗坍缩项可以估计数据密度，提出JEPA-SCORE方法，利用模型在样本x处的雅可比矩阵高效计算学习到的概率。

Result: 在合成数据、控制数据和Imagenet数据集上验证了理论发现，并在I-JEPA、DINOv2等自监督学习方法以及MetaCLIP等多模态模型上进行了实证检验。

Conclusion: JEPAs不仅能够学习下游任务的有效表征，其抗坍缩项还隐式地估计了数据密度，为数据管理、异常检测等应用提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able
to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two
objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a
slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在探索多样推理链时面临两难：需要注入随机性来探索多条路径，又要确保每条路径的质量。传统方法混淆了不同来源的不确定性，将低置信度与低质量等同，导致冲突。

Method: 提出三种策略：Greedy-Threshold在低置信度步骤采用贪婪采样；Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon基于估计的按排名正确性设置截断阈值。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中取得了性能提升，挑战了现有关于不确定性下解码的启发式方法。

Conclusion: 解码规则应基于正确性而非置信度进行校准，采样应从估计正确性较高的token中进行，在预期正确性较低时减少采样。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Transferring the recent advancements in deep learning into scientific
disciplines is hindered by the lack of the required large-scale datasets for
training. We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body
of scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of
governing physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering
Raman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)
measurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating
non-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover
Raman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is
a physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to
disentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the
Kramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss
on the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal.
Trained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and
significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that
training with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any
ground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results. This work
highlights a broader concept: formal scientific rules can act as a potent
inductive bias, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited
scientific domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于贝叶斯神经网络的新后验OOD检测方法，在小样本训练场景下优于确定性方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测对AI可靠性至关重要，但在实际应用中训练数据往往有限。贝叶斯神经网络能显式表示模型不确定性，在小样本场景下特别有价值

Method: 引入基于期望logit向量的贝叶斯后验OOD评分家族，比较了5种贝叶斯方法和4种确定性后验OOD评分方法

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，使用5000个或更少训练样本的实验表明，贝叶斯方法优于相应的确定性方法

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法在小样本OOD检测任务中表现出色，验证了其在处理模型不确定性方面的优势

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to AI reliability and safety,
yet in many practical settings, only a limited amount of training data is
available. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising class of model on
which to base OOD detection, because they explicitly represent epistemic (i.e.
model) uncertainty. In the small training data regime, BNNs are especially
valuable because they can incorporate prior model information. We introduce a
new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors, and
compare 5 Bayesian and 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores. Experiments on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 In-Distributions, with 5000 training samples or less, show that
the Bayesian methods outperform corresponding deterministic methods.

TL;DR: 该论文为过参数化插值区域中的Gibbs算法提供了数据依赖的测试误差边界，即使在随机标签等不可能数据上也能获得低训练误差。边界在Langevin Monte Carlo算法近似下保持稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在过参数化插值区域中Gibbs算法的泛化性能，特别是在训练误差很低但可能出现过拟合的情况下（如随机标签分类），建立可靠的测试误差边界。

Method: 提出数据依赖的测试误差边界方法，使用Gibbs算法在过参数化插值区域进行分析，并通过Langevin Monte Carlo算法进行稳定近似。在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 边界在真实标签数据上产生非平凡预测，并能正确上界随机标签的测试误差。实验表明边界在两种情况下均有效。

Conclusion: 该方法表明，在低温插值区域的泛化性能可以通过更经典的高温区域中的小训练误差来预示，为理解过参数化模型的泛化行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: The paper provides data-dependent bounds on the test error of the Gibbs
algorithm in the overparameterized interpolation regime, where low training
errors are also obtained for impossible data, such as random labels in
classification. The bounds are stable under approximation with Langevin Monte
Carlo algorithms. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets verify that
the bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true labeled data and correctly
upper bound the test error for random labels. Our method indicates that
generalization in the low-temperature, interpolation regime is already signaled
by small training errors in the more classical high temperature regime.

TL;DR: 提出了molFTP（分子片段-靶点流行度）表示方法，通过虚拟掩码防止特征泄漏，并证明key-loo能近似真实分子级LOO，偏差低于8%，实现近乎全数据训练同时保持无偏交叉验证性能估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种紧凑且能防止特征泄漏的分子表示方法，以在保持无偏交叉验证性能估计的同时实现近乎全数据训练。

Method: 使用分子片段-靶点流行度（molFTP）表示，采用虚拟掩码程序移除保留分子中片段信息，并引入key-loo近似真实分子级LOO。

Result: molFTP提供强大的预测性能，key-loo与真实LOO偏差低于8%，能够以低成本近似LOO效果。

Conclusion: molFTP是一种快速、抗泄漏的片段-靶点流行度向量化方法，通过虚拟掩码或key-LOO等实用保护措施，能以低成本实现LOO近似。

Abstract: We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact
representation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature
leakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure
that removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We
further show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true
molecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets.
This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation
estimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast,
leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical
safeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its
cost.

Conclusion: 该方法通过人类指导的分布式强化学习，成功解决了自动驾驶中的安全性和效率问题，为现实世界应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving with reinforcement learning (RL) has significant
potential. However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due
to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human
expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by
reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we
propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called
Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines
Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to
enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key
innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the
DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected
returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human
intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is
effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state
space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical
training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient
learning for autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖外部预训练模型，难以区分数据选择效果与外部模型影响，且忽略数据在模型收敛时的长期影响。

Method: 使用小型代理模型作为LLM替代，通过双层优化训练评分模型来估计训练样本的长期影响力，优化样本重要性权重。

Result: 在C4数据集上预训练Pythia和LLaMA模型，1B模型设置下达到SOTA方法1.7倍加速，在多个下游任务表现优异。

Conclusion: BLISS提供了一种高效、无需外部模型的数据选择方法，显著提升LLM预训练效率并改善下游任务性能。

Abstract: Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models
(LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.
However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained
models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from
those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the
long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,
primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this
paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence
\textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data
selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on
any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the
long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a
surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term
influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We
formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the
upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to
training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,
training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)
leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model
predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of
high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining
410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4
dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$
speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文创建了一个包含18,000多个散点图的合成数据集和基准测试，评估了OpenAI和Google模型在五个散点图特定任务上的性能。结果显示模型在计数任务上表现良好，但在定位任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型越来越多地用于数据分析和可视化，但现有基准测试很少针对散点图特定任务，限制了对其性能的深入了解。

Method: 创建了包含6个数据生成器和17种图表设计的18,000多个散点图的合成注释数据集，使用N-shot提示法评估OpenAI和Google的专有模型在五个任务上的表现。

Result: OpenAI模型和Gemini 2.5 Flash在计数聚类和识别异常值任务上表现良好（准确率90%+），但在定位相关任务上表现不佳（精确率和召回率接近或低于50%），图表设计对性能影响较小。

Conclusion: OpenAI模型和Gemini 2.5 Flash在散点图计数任务上是可行的选择，但在定位任务上仍有改进空间，建议避免使用宽高比较大或随机着色的散点图。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet
benchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into
performance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we
introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six
data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate
proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five
distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center
coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,
especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting
clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results
for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are
near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).
Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a
secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect
ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly. Supplementary materials are

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于时间点过程(TPPs)的Edit Flow过程，通过插入、删除和替换编辑操作将噪声传输到数据，在连续时间马尔可夫链框架内学习瞬时编辑率，从而在生成过程中减少必要的编辑操作数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时间点过程模型大多依赖自回归参数化，受限于顺序采样。最近的非自回归扩散模型通过离散马尔可夫链中的事件插入和删除来缓解这些问题，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 引入Edit Flow过程，通过插入、删除和替换三种编辑操作在连续时间马尔可夫链框架内学习瞬时编辑率，实现从噪声到数据的传输。

Result: 无条件训练模型在基准TPPs的各种无条件和条件生成任务中表现出生成灵活性，有效减少了生成过程中必要的编辑操作数量。

Conclusion: Edit Flow过程为时间点过程提供了一种灵活高效的建模方法，通过编辑操作减少了生成复杂度，在多种生成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event
sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on
autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling.
Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by
jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and
deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this
perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise
to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the
instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we
attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number
of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate
the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range
of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

Motivation: 多任务强化学习通常依赖任务元数据（如自然语言描述）来指导不同目标的行为，但如何有效利用这些元数据来索引和组合可重用技能仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出LEXPOL架构，使用文本编码器编码任务元数据，通过学习的门控模块选择或混合多个子策略，支持跨任务的端到端训练。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中，LEXPOL在成功率和样本效率上匹配或超越了强大的多任务基线，无需任务特定重训练。学习到的语言门能够组合专家策略，适应新任务描述和未见过的任务组合。

Conclusion: 自然语言元数据可以有效地索引和重新组合单个策略中的可重用技能，为多任务强化学习提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning often relies on task metadata -- such as
brief natural-language descriptions -- to guide behavior across diverse
objectives. We present Lexical Policy Networks (LEXPOL), a language-conditioned
mixture-of-policies architecture for multi-task RL. LEXPOL encodes task
metadata with a text encoder and uses a learned gating module to select or
blend among multiple sub-policies, enabling end-to-end training across tasks.
On MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or exceeds strong multi-task baselines
in success rate and sample efficiency, without task-specific retraining. To
analyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies
obtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate
composes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task
descriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that
natural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills
within a single policy.

Motivation: 研究深度图神经网络中导致过度平滑现象的因素，量化过度平滑程度，并找到缓解该问题的方法以提高深度GNN的性能。

Method: 提出MASED度量来量化过度平滑，推导层间边界，分析权重矩阵奇异值和节点嵌入范数的影响，并引入G-Reg正则化方案来增加边界限制。

Conclusion: 通过量化过度平滑并引入适当的正则化，可以在深度图神经网络中实现更好的性能，避免过度参数化或参数不足的问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of
oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis
is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify
the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which
aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this
quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two
different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node
embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight
matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show
that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the
number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise
bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,
adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we
introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and
demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification
accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that
by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in
some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold
start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled
nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size
(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.
This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of
trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of
the GNN.

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs尚不能完全复制人类适应性，但其提示引导的多样性为模拟策略无关队友提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training
agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or
non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive
human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic
data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three
experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory
paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions
from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and
Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward
structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating
consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies
prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM
outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse
and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic
grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce
trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully
replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable
foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

Conclusion: 轻量级参考引导基础为在高自由度系统中发现语义丰富和结构化技能提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to high-DoF agents remains
challenging. As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows
exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.
Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide
exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present
Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill
discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD
first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,
clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding
enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference
behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a
simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns
structured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and
also discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD
outperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest
that lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to
discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

Motivation: 混合线性动态系统在复杂噪声环境下应用困难，现有张量方法对噪声敏感，EM方法对初始化依赖强且容易陷入局部最优

Conclusion: MoLDS是建模复杂神经数据的有效框架，Tensor-EM是学习MoLDS的可靠方法

Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model
time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories.
However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings,
limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment
methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their
performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used
expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent
models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local
minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability
guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the
strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the
construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally
consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates
can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for
all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and
real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves
more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor
or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the
primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in
different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different
conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits
for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset
where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate
that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data,
and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these
applications.

Method: 提出Stratified GRPO方法，核心是分层优势归一化(SAN)，根据轨迹结构特性将轨迹划分为同质层，在每层内局部计算优势值

Result: 在多样单跳和多跳问答基准测试中，Stratified GRPO相比GRPO性能提升高达11.3分，训练奖励更高、稳定性更好、搜索策略更有效

Conclusion: 分层方法为LLM搜索代理中的结构异质性提供了原则性解决方案，能消除交叉层偏差，改进信用分配

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

Result: 在LLM去毒化任务中，失败感知IRL在多个指标上优于现有IRL基线，无需外部分类器或监督，提取的奖励能更好地反映RLHF的真实目标。

Conclusion: 失败感知IRL是审核模型对齐和减少IRL过程模糊性的稳健、可扩展方法，能更有效地支持重新RLHF训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于贝叶斯逆强化学习的LLM目标审计框架，能够量化不确定性、提供可操作的诊断，并验证策略级效用，增强AI的可信度和可问责性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型隐式优化的目标不透明，使得可信对齐和审计成为重大挑战。现有逆强化学习方法要么产生单一、过度自信的奖励估计，要么未能解决任务的根本模糊性（不可识别性）。

Method: 采用贝叶斯逆强化学习方法，不仅恢复目标分布，还实现三个关键审计能力：量化并系统减少不可识别性；提供可操作的不确定性感知诊断；验证策略级效用。

Result: 框架成功审计了一个去毒化的LLM，产生了校准良好且可解释的目标，增强了对齐保证。

Conclusion: 这项工作为审计人员、安全团队和监管机构提供了一个实用工具包，用于验证LLM真正试图实现的目标，推动AI向更可信和可问责的方向发展。

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding
of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional
tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of
dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an
underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do
neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact
performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of
training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles
of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning
representations.

Conclusion: 影响函数为定义推理数据质量提供了有效方法，基于影响的剪枝策略在推理任务中表现优异

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图描述符的MMD评估方法只能对生成模型进行排序，无法提供绝对性能度量，且对核函数和描述符参数化高度敏感，导致不同图描述符的结果不可比较。

Method: 使用二元分类器区分真实图和生成图，通过图描述符进行特征化，分类器的数据对数似然近似JS距离的变分下界。

Result: PGD指标约束在[0,1]区间内，可在不同图描述符间进行比较，并推导出理论基础的汇总指标提供更紧密的下界。

Conclusion: 实验证明PGD比MMD指标提供更鲁棒和深入的评估，PolyGraph框架已开源供图生成模型基准测试使用。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these
metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of
performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters,
namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across
different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new
evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the
Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to
distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors.
The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower
bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are
constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different
graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric
that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound
on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate
that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD
metrics. The PolyGraph framework for benchmarking graph generative models is
made publicly available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/polygraph-benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中模型压缩技术虽然能减小模型大小和计算成本，但传统评估只关注大小与准确性的权衡，忽略了模型忠实度。这在医疗、金融、刑事司法等高风险领域尤为重要，压缩模型必须保持与原模型一致的行为。

Method: 引入忠实度评估指标，包括使用模型一致性评估预测一致性，应用卡方检验检测整体数据集和人口统计子组中预测模式的统计显著变化，通过量化和剪枝技术压缩人工神经网络。

Result: 研究发现高准确性并不能保证忠实度，统计测试检测到了标准指标（如准确性和均等几率）遗漏的细微但显著的变化。

Conclusion: 提出的指标提供了一种实用且更直接的方法，确保通过压缩获得的效率提升不会损害可信AI所必需的公平性或忠实度。

Abstract: In real-world applications, computational constraints often require
transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model
compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost
without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused
on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model
faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like
healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain
faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a
novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond
standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics
that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions
include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the
original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared
tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across
both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts
that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by
applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained
on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high
accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect
subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as
Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more
direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not
compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了lm-Meter，第一个专为设备端LLM推理设计的轻量级在线延迟分析器，能够实时捕获细粒度的阶段级和内核级延迟，为设备端LLM系统优化提供关键性能洞察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM日益集成到日常应用中，云端部署引发数据隐私和可持续性担忧。设备端LLM运行可提供更好的隐私性、可靠性和降低通信成本，但由于内存和计算需求大，以及在资源受限硬件上性能效率权衡的可见性有限，实现这一愿景仍具挑战性。

Method: 开发lm-Meter分析器，在商用移动平台上实现，无需辅助设备即可捕获嵌入、预填充、解码、softmax、采样等阶段级和内核级的细粒度实时延迟，具有高分析精度和最小系统开销。

Result: lm-Meter在商用移动平台上实现，在最受限的省电模式下，预填充阶段吞吐量仅降低2.58%，解码阶段仅降低0.99%。通过lm-Meter进行的实证研究揭示了设备端LLM推理中的阶段级和内核级瓶颈，量化了精度效率权衡，并识别了系统性优化机会。

Conclusion: lm-Meter为受限平台上LLM的运行时行为提供了前所未有的可见性，为明智的优化奠定了基础，并加速了设备端LLM系统的民主化进程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications, but their prevalent cloud-based deployment raises growing
concerns around data privacy and long-term sustainability. Running LLMs locally
on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced
privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this
vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as
well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on
resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,
online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures
fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,
decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We
implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high
profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput
reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave
governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies
revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,
quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic
optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the
runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for
informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM
systems. Code and tutorials are available at

Conclusion: 先验信息驱动的适应适合增强基础模型处理高维数据的能力，为生物医学应用提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Revealing novel insights from the relationship between molecular measurements
and pathology remains a very impactful application of machine learning in
biomedicine. Data in this domain typically contain only a few observations but
thousands of potentially noisy features, posing challenges for conventional
machine learning approaches. While prior-data fitted networks emerge as
foundation models for tabular data, they are currently not suited to handle
large feature counts (>500). Although feature reduction enables their
application, it hinders feature importance analysis. We propose a strategy that
extends existing models through continued pre-training on synthetic data
sampled from a customized prior. The resulting model, TabPFN-Wide, matches or
exceeds its base model's performance while exhibiting improved robustness to
noise. It seamlessly scales beyond 50,000 features, regardless of noise levels,
while maintaining inherent interpretability, which is critical for biomedical
applications. Our results show that prior-informed adaptation is suitable to
enhance the capability of foundation models for high-dimensional data. On
real-world biomedical datasets many of the most relevant features identified by
the model overlap with previous biological findings, while others propose
potential starting points for future studies.

Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how
various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output
prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act
independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves
interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature
contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order
feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients
(IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable
AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural
connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several
theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a
few examples.

Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models
and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on
entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the
negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy
rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic
dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates -
system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the
thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon
and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects
generative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through
stochastic thermodynamics.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of
safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as
a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle
graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However,
such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational
complexity, but also the strict modeling assumptions that might yield poor
coverage, especially with labels arriving on the fly. To effect scalability, we
devise a novel graph-aware parametric GP model by leveraging the random feature
(RF)-based kernel approximation, which is amenable to efficient recursive
Bayesian model updates. To further allow for adaptivity, an ensemble of
graph-aware RF-based scalable GPs have been leveraged, with per-GP weight
adapted to data arriving incrementally. To ensure valid coverage with
robustness to model mis-specification, we wed the GP-based set predictors with
the online conformal prediction framework, which post-processes the prediction
sets using adaptive thresholds. Experimental results the proposed method yields
improved coverage and efficient prediction sets over existing baselines by
adaptively ensembling the GP models and setting the key threshold parameters in
CP.

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了增加数据集规模会固有地损害量化效果的假设，证明通过策略性训练超参数干预可以在大规模训练中提高量化质量。

Abstract: While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment
of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness
remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation
across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters
and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training
dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization
errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between
learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning
rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely
independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the
training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate
quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled
experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that
increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness,
demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can
improve quantization quality at scale.
