*Amir Noorizadegan,Sifan Wang,Leevan Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)进行了系统全面的综述，分析了其理论基础、架构变体和实际实现策略，并提供了实用的架构选择指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs作为传统多层感知器(MLPs)的有前景替代方案，具有更强的表达能力和可解释性，需要对其快速发展的研究领域进行系统梳理。

Method: 收集和分类大量开源实现，建立KANs与MLPs的概念桥梁，分析不同基函数选择的权衡，并分类整理提高准确性、效率和正则化的技术。

Result: 构建了清晰的KAN发展路线图，涵盖了物理信息损失设计、自适应采样、域分解、混合架构等关键技术，并提供了实用的架构选择指南。

Conclusion: KANs在参数效率和可解释性方面优于MLPs，本文为研究人员和从业者提供了系统的参考框架，并指出了当前研究空白。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review
complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiMAE是一个分层掩码自编码器框架，通过多分辨率嵌入来探索可穿戴传感器数据中不同时间尺度的重要性，在保持高效性的同时优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器产生大量生理时间序列数据，但其预测效用的基本原则尚不清楚。作者假设时间分辨率是表征学习的基本轴，不同的临床和行为结果依赖于不同尺度的结构。

Method: 引入HiMAE（分层掩码自编码器），这是一个结合掩码自编码与分层卷积编码器-解码器的自监督框架，产生多分辨率嵌入。

Result: 在分类、回归和生成基准测试中，HiMAE始终优于那些压缩尺度的最先进基础模型，同时模型规模小几个数量级。HiMAE足够紧凑，可以在手表上完全运行，在智能手表级CPU上实现亚毫秒级推理。

Conclusion: HiMAE既是一种高效的自监督学习方法，也是发现可穿戴健康数据中尺度敏感结构的发现工具。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable
representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes
the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of
framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super
explosives higher than 9 km/s predicted detonation velocity.

### [4] [The Kinetics of Reasoning: How Chain-of-Thought Shapes Learning in Transformers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25791)
*Zihan Pengmei,Costas Mavromatis,Zhengyuan Shen,Yunyi Zhang,Vassilis N. Ioannidis,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了思维链监督如何影响Transformer模型的学习动态，发现CoT能加速泛化但无法克服高算法复杂度任务，揭示了训练过程中存在暂时性的推理轨迹不忠实阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链监督能显著提升Transformer性能，但模型如何学习遵循并从中受益的机制仍不清楚。本文旨在通过可控的实验设置来理解这些学习动态。

Method: 在符号推理任务上预训练Transformer，通过调整算法复杂度和数据组成来研究泛化。比较两种训练设置：仅输出最终答案和输出CoT推理轨迹后再回答。使用三参数逻辑曲线建模学习动态。

Result: CoT通常能提升任务表现，但其效果取决于任务复杂度。模型在训练早期会出现推理轨迹不忠实现象（正确答案但错误推理），后期才对齐。CoT能加速泛化但不能解决高复杂度任务。

Conclusion: CoT监督改变了Transformer的内部计算机制，加速了泛化过程，但无法克服固有的算法复杂度限制。推理轨迹的忠实性是一个动态发展的特性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

### [5] [Optimal Information Combining for Multi-Agent Systems Using Adaptive Bias Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25793)
*Siavash M. Alamouti,Fay Arjomandi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个理论框架来分析和校正多智能体系统中的系统性偏差，引入可学习性比率概念，并开发了ABLOC算法来迭代学习偏差校正变换，同时优化组合权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多智能体系统（如传感器网络、众包平台）因环境条件变化导致的系统性偏差会显著降低性能。现有方法要么忽略偏差导致次优决策，要么需要昂贵的校准程序。

Method: 开发理论框架将偏差分解为可学习的系统性成分和不可约的随机成分，引入可学习性比率概念，并提出ABLOC算法迭代学习偏差校正变换并优化组合权重。

Result: 实验验证表明，具有高可学习性比率的系统可以恢复显著性能（在示例中实现了理论最大改进的40%-70%），而低可学习性系统获益甚微。

Conclusion: 可学习性比率决定了偏差学习是否值得投资，为系统设计者提供了何时投资偏差学习与采用更简单方法的定量指导。

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

### [6] [Non-myopic Matching and Rebalancing in Large-Scale On-Demand Ride-Pooling Systems Using Simulation-Informed Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25796)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模拟的强化学习方法，用于解决拼车系统中的短视决策问题，通过非短视策略显著提升服务率并减少等待时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拼车服务虽然能降低成本和环境影响，但现有系统存在短视决策的局限性，忽视了调度决策的长期影响。

Method: 将Xu等人(2018)的学习和规划框架从网约车扩展到拼车系统，在learning机制中嵌入拼车模拟以实现非短视决策，并提出空闲车辆再平衡策略。

Result: 非短视匹配策略相比短视策略可将服务率提升8.4%，减少乘客等待时间和车内时间；车队规模可减少25%以上；加入再平衡操作后等待时间减少27.3%，车内时间减少12.5%，服务率提升15.1%。

Conclusion: 提出的非短视决策框架能显著提升拼车系统性能，为运营商带来显著成本节约，但再平衡操作会增加车辆行驶时间。

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemEIC是一种用于大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)的持续组合知识编辑方法，通过混合外部-内部编辑器和双重外部记忆实现跨模态知识编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术通常只关注单一模态，忽视了LVLMs的多模态特性和知识更新的连续性，导致编辑效果不佳。

Method: 采用混合外部-内部编辑器，包含双重外部记忆用于跨模态证据检索和双重LoRA适配器实现各模态解耦参数更新，以及受大脑启发的知识连接器进行组合推理。

Result: 实验表明MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上显著提升性能，并能有效保持先前编辑结果，为LVLMs的持续组合知识编辑设立了新基准。

Conclusion: MemEIC通过多模态持续组合编辑方法，有效解决了LVLMs知识更新的挑战，为动态信息环境下的模型维护提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了时间序列预测中的频谱偏差现象，提出了FreLE算法来缓解这一问题，通过频率正则化提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据的自相关性给多变量时间序列预测带来挑战，现有研究观察到神经网络中的频谱偏差现象，但往往将其归因于特定架构而非普遍特性。

Method: 通过广泛实证实验测量主流模型的频谱偏差，提出FreLE算法，通过显式和隐式频率正则化增强模型泛化能力，这是一个即插即用的损失函数单元。

Result: 实验证明几乎所有模型都表现出频谱偏差现象，大量实验验证了FreLE的优越性能。

Conclusion: 频谱偏差是时间序列预测模型的普遍特性，FreLE算法能有效缓解这一问题，提升预测性能。

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at
https://github.com/Chenxing-Xuan/FreLE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的Julia优化框架DiffOpt.jl，通过微分KKT系统来计算优化问题的前向和反向模式敏感度，支持光滑和非凸程序，消除了传统系数级接口的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于求解器专业化和接口不匹配，在实际系统中集成约束优化问题的微分仍然具有挑战性，需要更通用的框架来简化建模和微分过程。

Method: 在Julia优化栈中构建统一框架，通过微分KKT系统计算敏感度，提供基于JuMP的参数中心API，允许用户声明命名参数并直接获取导数。

Result: 框架在凸和非凸模型上展示了能力，包括经济调度、投资组合选择和机器人逆运动学等应用，并在大规模研究中证明了其影响力。

Conclusion: 可微分优化可以成为实验、学习、校准和设计的常规工具，同时保持标准JuMP建模实践并访问广泛的求解器生态系统。

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

TL;DR: 提出SPECS框架，通过自蒸馏生成偏好数据对，使用偏好训练而非SFT进行冷启动，解耦多模态学习，在多个基准测试中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于SFT的冷启动方法将推理范式与任务解决方案和输出格式交织，可能导致指令风格过拟合，削弱分布外泛化能力，并影响下游强化学习。

Method: SPECS框架：1) 通过自蒸馏生成内省偏好数据对；2) 进行偏好训练，专注于浅层可转移的表面形式标准；3) 将学习结果传递给具有可验证奖励的强化学习进行深度推理。

Conclusion: 偏好训练方法在冷启动阶段比SFT方法具有更好的泛化能力，解耦学习框架能够有效提升多模态模型的性能表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

### [11] [Implicit Bias of Per-sample Adam on Separable Data: Departure from the Full-batch Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26303)
*Beomhan Baek,Minhak Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了增量Adam优化器在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差，发现其与全批次Adam的ℓ∞-最大间隔偏差不同，增量Adam可能收敛到ℓ2-最大间隔分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam是深度学习中最常用的优化器，但其理论理解仍然有限。先前分析表明Adam偏好ℓ∞-几何解，但这些结果仅限于全批次情况。本研究旨在探索增量Adam（每步使用一个样本）的隐式偏差。

Method: 研究增量Adam在线性可分数据上的逻辑回归，构造结构化数据集证明其收敛行为，开发代理算法捕捉β2→1时的极限行为，并通过数据依赖的双重固定点公式表征收敛方向。

Result: 增量Adam的隐式偏差与全批次Adam不同，在特定结构化数据集上收敛到ℓ2-最大间隔分类器。Signum优化器在任何批次大小下都收敛到ℓ∞-最大间隔分类器。

Conclusion: Adam的隐式偏差关键取决于批处理方案和数据集，而Signum保持不变。增量Adam可能偏离全批次Adam的ℓ∞-几何偏好，收敛到ℓ2-最大间隔解。

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

TL;DR: 提出MoE-POT模型，使用稀疏激活的专家混合架构，在控制推理成本的同时高效扩展参数，显著降低PDE求解的零样本误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PDE数据集的异质性导致混合训练误差高的问题，以及密集预训练模型推理成本高的问题。

Method: 采用分层路由器门控网络，从16个专家网络中动态选择4个路由专家，同时集成2个共享专家，最终输出为所有激活专家结果的加权平均。

Result: 在6个公共PDE数据集上预训练30M到0.5B参数模型，90M激活参数的模型相比现有120M参数模型零样本误差降低40%。

Conclusion: MoE架构能够有效处理PDE问题的异质性，路由器决策可推断数据集类型，验证了该架构的合理性和有效性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep
learning dominates recent MTL research, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Twin
SVMs (TWSVMs) remain relevant due to their interpretability, theoretical rigor,
and effectiveness with small datasets.
  This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting
shared representations, task regularization, and structural coupling
strategies. Special attention is given to emerging TWSVM extensions for
multi-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare
these models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and
empirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer
vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building
scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks. This work
provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested
in SVM- and TWSVM-based multi-task learning.

### [14] [PRESTO: Preimage-Informed Instruction Optimization for Prompting Black-Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25808)
*Jaewon Chu,Seunghun Lee,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRESTO是一个利用软提示预像结构来优化黑盒大语言模型指令的框架，通过分数共享、预像初始化和分数一致性正则化，在相同查询预算下获得14倍评分数据，实现更高效的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒LLMs的指令优化面临冗余查询问题，因为白盒LLMs通常将不同的软提示映射到相同的指令。传统方法认为这种多对一映射阻碍优化效率，但本文将其重新解释为可加速优化的先验知识。

Method: PRESTO框架包含三个核心组件：(1)分数共享：在预像内共享评估分数；(2)预像初始化：利用预像信息选择最大化搜索空间覆盖的初始数据点；(3)分数一致性正则化：在每个预像内强制执行预测一致性。

Result: 在33个指令优化任务上的实验结果表明，PRESTO表现出优越性能，在相同查询预算下有效获得14倍评分数据，实现更高效的优化。

Conclusion: 通过利用软提示的预像结构，PRESTO框架能够显著提高黑盒LLMs指令优化的效率，证明了将多对一映射重新解释为有用先验知识的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

*Sungho Koh,SeungJu Cha,Hyunwoo Oh,Kwanyoung Lee,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDiff是一个无需训练的高效框架，通过Neighborhood Patch Attention和Latent Frequency Mixing等技术，扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率，在图像质量和推理速度方面达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在超出训练分辨率时性能下降的问题，现有无需训练方法计算量大且不兼容Diffusion Transformer模型。

Method: 提出Neighborhood Patch Attention减少自注意力层计算冗余，结合SDEdit流程和Latent Frequency Mixing生成细节，使用Structure Guidance增强全局结构。

Result: 在U-Net和Diffusion Transformer架构上，ScaleDiff在图像质量和推理速度方面均达到训练免费方法中的最先进性能。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff是一个模型无关的高效框架，无需额外训练即可有效扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

*Xiaoke Huang,Ningsen Wang,Hui Liu,Xianfeng Tang,Yuyin Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MedVLSynther框架，通过生成器-验证器方法从开放生物医学文献中合成高质量的多选题VQA项目，构建了MedSynVQA数据集，训练的开源LMM在多个医学VQA基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练通用医学VQA系统面临高质量开放数据集的缺乏，现有大规模多模态模型需要大量高质量的医学视觉问答数据。

Method: 采用基于规则的生成器-验证器框架，从PubMed Central中提取图像、标题和文本引用，生成自包含的问题主干和互斥选项，通过多阶段验证确保质量。

Result: 构建了包含13,087个问题和14,803张图像的MedSynVQA数据集，涵盖13种成像模式和28个解剖区域。训练的开源LMM在六个医学VQA基准测试中平均准确率达到55.85(3B)和58.15(7B)，最高在VQA-RAD上达到77.57。

Conclusion: MedVLSynther提供了一条可审计、可重复且保护隐私的路径，用于扩展医学VQA训练数据，完全基于开放文献和开源模型。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了π_RL框架，用于在并行模拟中训练基于流的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过两种强化学习算法解决了流模型难以计算动作对数似然的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然最近工作探索使用强化学习来自动化监督微调的数据收集过程，但由于迭代去噪导致难以计算动作对数似然，将大规模RL应用于基于流的VLA模型仍然具有挑战性。

Method: π_RL框架实现两种RL算法：(1)Flow-Noise将去噪过程建模为离散时间MDP，使用可学习的噪声网络进行精确对数似然计算；(2)Flow-SDE将去噪与智能体-环境交互集成，构建两层MDP，采用ODE到SDE转换实现高效RL探索。

Result: 在LIBERO基准上，π_RL将少样本SFT模型π_0和π_0.5分别从57.6%提升至97.6%和从77.1%提升至98.3%。在ManiSkill中，在320个并行环境中训练，将π_0从41.6%提升至85.7%，π_0.5从40.0%提升至84.8%，覆盖4352个拾放任务。

Conclusion: π_RL实现了显著的性能提升和比SFT模型更强的泛化能力，验证了在线强化学习对于基于流的VLA模型的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主动学习中探索与利用的核心挑战，特别是在标签预算稀缺的情况下，需要更有效的方法来平衡这两个阶段。

Method: 基于平衡福尔曼曲率的核心集构建算法指导探索，包含数据驱动的停止准则；使用BFC动态触发从探索到利用的转换；引入局部图重连策略来增强标签传播。

Result: 在基准分类任务上的实验表明，该方法在低标签率下持续优于现有的基于图的半监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的图拓扑方法通过智能的探索-利用平衡机制和局部图优化，在标签稀缺情况下实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在多领域环境中估计因果效应的问题，其中存在未观察到的混杂因子，且因果效应可能在不同领域间变化。

Method: 使用混杂因子的代理变量，假设所有变量都是离散或分类的。提出两种估计技术，证明一致性，并推导置信区间。

Result: 证明了即使在治疗和响应变量连续的情况下也具有可识别性。通过模拟研究和真实世界案例验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效估计目标领域中的因果效应，即使存在未观察到的混杂因子且因果效应在不同领域间变化。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

TL;DR: 提出使用任务驱动的表示方法，在主动学习过程中定期更新表示，显著提升了在混乱数据池中的性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动学习方法在处理混乱、未整理的数据池时效果有限，因为它们依赖固定的无监督表示，无法捕捉与目标任务相关的信息

Method: 提出两种任务驱动表示学习策略：1）直接学习半监督表示；2）在初始无监督表示基础上进行监督微调

Result: 两种策略都显著优于使用无监督或预训练表示的方法

Conclusion: 在主动学习过程中定期更新任务驱动表示是处理混乱数据池的有效方法

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

TL;DR: 提出InvGNN-WM方法，通过图不变量的隐式感知实现无触发器的图神经网络水印，具有黑盒验证、低任务影响和高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN水印方法依赖后门触发器，容易受常见模型编辑影响并产生所有权模糊问题，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 使用轻量级头部预测所有者私有载体集上的归一化代数连通性，通过符号敏感解码器输出比特，校准阈值控制误报率。

Result: 在多种节点和图分类数据集及骨干网络上，InvGNN-WM保持清洁准确率的同时，水印准确率高于基于触发器和压缩的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法对非结构化剪枝、微调和训练后量化保持强鲁棒性，证明精确移除是NP完全问题，为GNN知识产权保护提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统哈希或独热编码方法在处理高基数分类标识符时存在信息丢失或维度爆炸问题，需要一种既能保持可逆性又具有计算可扩展性的编码方法。

Method: 利用有限域上的模运算和可逆线性变换，构建可逆的确定性编码机制，支持维度控制和计算扩展性。

Result: 在MovieLens 20M数据集上的实验表明，MLT在预测性能上与监督嵌入相当，但参数数量和训练成本显著降低。

Conclusion: MLT提供了一种高效可逆的高基数分类标识符编码方案，在保持性能的同时大幅减少了计算资源需求。

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub

Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家的常规健康数据存在报告延迟和覆盖不全的问题，需要探索新的数据源和分析方法

Method: 使用XGBoost模型，比较Google PDFM、AlphaEarth和移动电话CDR三种GeoFM嵌入源与传统地理插值方法，基于552个健康服务区数据

Result: 集成三种嵌入源的多GeoFM模型表现最稳健，在人口密度、新增HIV病例和儿童疫苗接种等指标上取得较好预测效果，但在结核病和营养不良等数据稀缺指标上预测效果差

Conclusion: GeoFM嵌入为LMIC环境下的健康人口统计结果提供了适度的预测改进，多源GeoFM集成是补充和加强受限常规健康信息系统的有效工具

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管InfoNCE目标在对比表示学习中很受欢迎，但它与互信息的间接联系使其不能作为有效的互信息估计器，需要开发更准确的估计方法。

Method: 引入辅助锚点类进行一致的密度比估计，提出InfoNCE-anchor方法，并使用适当的评分规则将NCE、InfoNCE和f-散度变体统一到一个框架中。

Result: InfoNCE-anchor显著减少了互信息估计的偏差，在自监督表示学习实验中，锚点方法虽然提高了互信息估计准确性，但并未改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 对比表示学习的优势不在于准确的互信息估计本身，而在于学习结构化的密度比。

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

Motivation: 传统反向传播在生物学合理性方面存在不足，且不适合持续适应场景。预测编码框架虽然具有生物学合理性，但计算开销较大。

Method: PCN-TA通过跨时间帧保留潜在状态，利用时间相关性来减少计算需求。

Result: 在COIL-20数据集上，PCN-TA相比反向传播减少10%权重更新，相比基线PC网络减少50%推理步骤。

Conclusion: PCN-TA为资源受限的机器人系统提供了高效的在线学习方法，适合边缘部署和神经形态硬件实现。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling

### [27] [Infrequent Exploration in Linear Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26000)
*Harin Lee,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了INFEX框架，在强化学习中实现稀疏探索，平衡了完全自适应探索和纯贪婪方法的优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决线性bandit中探索频率过高或过低的问题，在安全关键或成本高昂的领域，连续探索不切实际，而纯贪婪策略在缺乏上下文多样性时会失败。

Method: 引入INFEX框架，按预定调度执行基础探索策略，在探索间隔期间主要选择贪婪动作。这是一个通用模块化框架，可与任何完全自适应探索方法集成。

Result: 理论分析表明，只要探索频率超过对数阈值，INFEX就能实现与标准可证明高效算法相匹配的实例依赖遗憾。实证评估证实了理论发现，展现了最先进的遗憾性能和运行时改进。

Conclusion: INFEX是一个简单实用的稀疏探索框架，在保持理论保证的同时提高了计算效率，适用于各种实际应用场景。

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于离散时间生存分析的双混合专家框架，结合特征编码器和风险预测的MoE，在乳腺癌数据集上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存分析需要同时建模患者异质性和时间动态性，现有方法难以灵活整合这两方面

Method: 使用双混合专家框架：特征编码器MoE用于亚组感知表示学习，风险MoE利用患者特征和时间嵌入捕获时间动态

Result: 在METABRIC和GBSG乳腺癌数据集上，时间依赖性C指数在测试集上提升高达0.04，融入Consurv框架后获得进一步增益

Conclusion: 双MoE框架能够有效建模患者异质性和时间动态，提升生存分析性能，并能灵活集成到现有深度学习生存分析流程中

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: 知识蒸馏会削弱模型的去偏能力，但通过高质量数据增强、迭代蒸馏和教师权重初始化可以改善这一状况


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究知识蒸馏对模型去偏能力迁移的影响，探索KD如何影响模型在分布外数据上的鲁棒性

Method: 在自然语言推理和图像分类任务上进行广泛实验，分析注意力模式和内部机制，提出三种改进方案

Result: KD会削弱去偏能力，训练去偏模型不会从教师知识中受益，不同偏见的鲁棒性变化显著

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模研究KD对去偏影响及其内部机制的工作，为设计更好的去偏方法提供了理解

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了符号回归中的缩放规律，发现验证损失和求解率都遵循计算量的幂律趋势，并确定了计算最优的超参数缩放关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号回归旨在从观测数据中发现数学表达式，这对科学洞察和可解释模型很重要。深度学习SR方法已能与遗传编程竞争，但缩放规律尚未被探索。

Method: 使用可扩展的端到端transformer管道和精心生成的训练数据，研究了五种不同模型大小，跨越三个数量级的计算量。

Result: 验证损失和求解率都遵循计算量的幂律趋势，确定了计算最优的超参数缩放：最佳批大小和学习率随模型大小增长，token与参数比约为15是最优的。

Conclusion: SR性能很大程度上可以从计算量预测，这为训练下一代SR模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种超越传统参数优化的机器学习新范式，将模型本身视为可塑几何实体，通过优化预定义拓扑流形上的度量张量场来动态塑造模型空间的几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在固定几何空间中搜索最优参数，限制了模型的表达能力。本文旨在通过动态几何结构优化来突破这一限制，实现更强大的模型表达能力。

Method: 构建变分框架，损失函数平衡数据保真度和流形内在几何复杂度；使用离散微分几何方法，将连续流形离散化为三角网格，通过边长度参数化度量张量，利用自动微分工具进行高效优化。

Result: 理论分析揭示了该框架与广义相对论中爱因斯坦-希尔伯特作用的深刻类比，为"数据驱动几何"概念提供了优雅物理解释；证明了即使固定拓扑，度量优化也比固定几何模型具有显著更强的表达能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建能够自主演化几何和拓扑的完全动态"元学习器"奠定了坚实基础，在科学模型发现和鲁棒表示学习等领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Motivation: 合成数据生成已成为解决在机器学习应用中使用敏感金融数据挑战的有前景方法。通过生成模型可以创建保持真实金融记录统计特性的人工数据集，同时减轻隐私风险和监管约束。该领域快速发展但缺乏对当前研究现状的综合分析。

Method: 系统综述了2018年以来发表的72项研究，对这些研究进行了分类分析，包括合成的金融信息类型、使用的生成方法以及评估数据效用和隐私的策略。

Result: 研究发现基于GAN的方法在文献中占主导地位，特别是在生成时间序列市场数据和表格信用数据方面。虽然一些创新技术显示出改善真实性和隐私保护的潜力，但研究中对隐私保障的严格评估普遍缺乏。

Conclusion: 通过提供生成技术、应用和评估方法的综合概述，该综述强调了关键的研究空白，并为未来开发稳健、保护隐私的金融领域合成数据解决方案提供了指导。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

TL;DR: Nirvana是一个具有专业化记忆机制、线性时间复杂度和测试时任务信息提取能力的专业化通用模型，通过任务感知记忆触发器动态调整记忆机制，在通用语言任务和医疗任务上都取得了优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM结构缺乏基于任务信息的专业化记忆机制，无法在保持通用能力的同时在特定领域达到专家级性能。

Method: 提出Nirvana模型，包含任务感知记忆触发器(Trigger)和专业化记忆更新器(Updater)，Trigger根据当前任务需求灵活调整记忆机制，Updater动态记忆由Trigger引导的上下文。

Result: 在多种自然语言建模基准测试中取得竞争性或更优结果；在MRI医疗任务上，通过轻量级编解码器后训练，实现了比传统MRI模型和传统LLM骨干网络更高质量的MRI重建，并能生成准确的初步临床报告。

Conclusion: Nirvana通过专业化记忆机制成功实现了在保持通用能力的同时在特定领域达到专家级性能的目标，证明了任务感知记忆机制的有效性。

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的多阶段bug二分法管道，能够充分利用补丁信息和提交信息，通过渐进式筛选显著提高bug引入提交识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于补丁的二分法存在多个局限：假设bug引入提交和补丁提交修改相同函数、仅依赖代码变更而忽略提交信息中的漏洞信息、基于简单启发式方法缺乏逻辑分析。大语言模型能够同时理解文本和代码，有望突破这些限制。

Method: 设计了一个综合多阶段管道，利用大语言模型：(1)充分利用补丁信息，(2)在上下文中比较多个候选提交，(3)通过一系列筛选步骤逐步缩小候选范围。

Result: 评估显示该方法比现有最优解决方案的准确率提高了38%以上，多阶段管道相比基线LLM二分法准确率提高了60%。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的多阶段管道能够有效克服传统二分法的局限性，在bug引入提交识别方面取得了显著更好的性能。

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于多智能体强化学习的动态车辆路由方法：自适应导航(AN)和分层枢纽自适应导航(HHAN)，用于解决城市交通拥堵问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最短路径优先算法在动态多车辆环境中表现不佳，会导致所有车辆选择相同路径而加剧拥堵。需要开发能够协调多车辆、考虑网络状态的智能路由系统。

Method: AN使用分散式MARL，每个交叉口智能体基于本地交通和图注意力网络建模的邻域状态提供路由指导。HHAN扩展AN，仅在关键枢纽部署智能体，采用集中训练分散执行的A-QMIX框架协调枢纽间路由。

Result: 在合成网格和真实城市地图上的实验表明，AN相比SPF和学习基线减少了平均旅行时间，保持100%路由成功率。HHAN可扩展到数百个交叉口的网络，在重交通下实现高达15.9%的改进。

Conclusion: 网络约束的MARL方法在智能交通系统中具有实现可扩展、协调和拥堵感知路由的潜力。

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习评估基于测试集上的平均损失，但在天气和气候预测中，这忽略了人类发展和地理分布的不均匀性，无法反映模型在不同区域的真实表现。

Method: 开发SAFE工具包，整合多种数据域，按国家、全球子区域、收入水平和土地覆盖等属性对地理网格点进行分层，评估模型在每个分层上的性能。

Result: 对多个最先进的AI天气预报模型进行基准测试，发现所有模型在所有属性上都表现出预测技能的差异，建立了基于不同预报时效和气候变量的模型公平性基准。

Conclusion: 通过超越全局平均指标，首次能够回答模型在哪些区域表现最佳或最差，以及哪些模型最公平，为天气预报模型的公平性评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法受限于LLM初始能力，容易陷入探索停滞，无法解决更多训练问题。虽然有工作尝试使用离策略解决方案，但需要外部专家指导且可用性有限

Method: LTE方法通过提示LLM学习自己之前生成的错误答案和过长响应，不需要任何外部专家指导

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，LTE比普通GRPO在Pass@1上平均提升6.38，在Pass@k上平均提升9.00。分析证实LTE成功缓解了探索停滞问题，增强了训练中的利用和探索

Conclusion: LTE方法有效解决了RLVR中的探索停滞问题，无需外部专家指导就能显著提升LLM的推理能力

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

Motivation: WiFi CSI人体活动识别在边缘设备部署时面临域偏移问题，环境变化导致识别性能显著下降，需要一种自主适应机制来维持长期稳定的感知能力。

Method: 采用跨模态师生架构，用高精度YOLO视觉模型作为动态监督信号，为CSI数据流提供实时活动标签，在线微调轻量级CSI模型STAR，实现闭环重训练。

Result: 在未校准硬件上，基线STAR模型准确率从93.52%降至49.14%，经过一次视觉引导适应后，准确率恢复至81.51%。

Conclusion: maxVSTAR证明了在隐私敏感的物联网环境中实现动态自监督模型适应的能力，为边缘CSI感知建立了可扩展的长期自主HAR范式。

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.

Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉分子与其描述之间的细微差异，缺乏学习分子子结构与化学短语之间细粒度对齐的能力。

Method: 通过分子子结构和化学短语的额外对齐信号增强原始分子-描述对，采用子结构感知对比学习和自优化机制过滤噪声对齐信号。

Result: 实验结果表明MolBridge有效捕捉细粒度对应关系，在多个分子基准测试中优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 子结构感知对齐在分子-文本学习中具有重要意义，MolBridge框架展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Method: 评估变化点导出的统计特征、基于聚类的子结构表示和混合学习策略，并与简单的随机森林+XGBoost集成模型在分段数据上的表现进行对比。

Result: 复杂方法表现不佳，集成模型达到AUC-ROC 0.976、F1分数0.41，并在定义时间窗口内实现100%早期检测。

Conclusion: 在高度不平衡和时间不确定的数据场景中，模型简单性结合优化分段可以超越更复杂的架构，提供更好的鲁棒性、可解释性和操作实用性。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共资源分配方法独立优化单个资源移动，未考虑容量约束，需要更实用的协作分配方法。

Method: 将CPRA问题建模为势博弈，证明势函数与最优目标无间隙，提出GSTRL框架捕捉系统时空动态。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验显示GSTRL具有优越性能。

Conclusion: GSTRL为CPRA问题提供了理论基础和有效解决方案，在真实场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

*Yunxiao Shi,Shuo Yang,Yixin Su,Rui Zhang,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ACC-SGD-IE方法，通过跨训练传播留一扰动并更新累积影响状态，比标准SGD-IE更准确地估计样本影响，特别是在长周期训练中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代以数据为中心的AI需要精确的逐样本影响估计。标准SGD-IE方法通过求和每周期代理来近似留一效果，但忽略了跨周期复合效应，导致对关键样本的错误排名。

Method: ACC-SGD-IE是一种轨迹感知估计器，在训练过程中传播留一扰动，并在每个步骤更新累积影响状态。在平滑强凸设置下实现几何误差收缩，在平滑非凸机制下收紧误差界限。

Result: 在Adult、20 Newsgroups和MNIST数据集上的实验表明，ACC-SGD-IE在干净和污染数据以及凸和非凸训练下都能产生更准确的影响估计，特别是在长周期中。在下游数据清理中更可靠地标记噪声样本。

Conclusion: 使用ACC-SGD-IE清理的数据训练的模型优于使用SGD-IE清理的模型，证明了该方法在数据影响估计和清理方面的优越性。

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，其次是逻辑回归和支持向量机。这些模型能识别导致再入院的关键因素。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型可有效识别再入院风险因素，帮助医院重点关注高危患者，从而降低再入院率和医疗成本，提高医疗质量。

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

Result: AISP在样本使用数量方面优于最佳n采样，并且比其他基于奖励的测试时对齐方法获得更高的奖励。

Conclusion: AISP是一种有效的测试时对齐方法，能够在不需要微调的情况下优化模型性能。

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法在现实部署中面临可扩展性问题，需要完整访问原始数据集和模型，而本文旨在解决这些实际挑战。

Method: 将分类训练视为顺序过程，通过逆转最后训练序列实现遗忘，在模型末端添加投影重分布层作为输出过滤器。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法输出与完全重训练模型相似，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在实际环境中具有适用性、可扩展性和系统兼容性，同时保持输出性能。

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为调控方法局限于二维子空间，对参数敏感且可能影响无关特征，需要更灵活稳定的调控方法。

Method: 将调控建模为几何旋转，向目标行为方向旋转激活向量，并提出自适应版本仅旋转与目标特征对齐的激活。

Result: 在多个模型家族和尺寸上的实验表明，Angular Steering能实现鲁棒的行为控制，同时保持通用语言建模性能。

Conclusion: Angular Steering在灵活性、泛化性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法，为安全可靠AI部署提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

Conclusion: IMG可作为优化的扩散过程集成到现有方法中进一步提升性能，多目标玻尔兹曼分布是分布多目标优化问题的最优解

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效处理多用户偏好学习和离线数据不平衡问题，通过聚类和主动采样策略提高了学习效果。

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于token感知的因果表示学习框架，通过语言token的结构化因果模型来解释CLIP在组合推理上的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在跨模态泛化方面表现出色，但在对象、属性和关系的组合推理上持续失败，现有因果解释通常将文本建模为单一向量，无法解释token级结构和核心现象。

Method: 提出基于语言token序列的结构化因果模型框架，将块可识别性扩展到token化文本，证明CLIP的对比目标可以在句子级和token级SCM下恢复模态不变潜在变量。

Result: 发现组合不可识别性现象：存在伪最优文本编码器，在模态不变对齐上表现完美，但对原子概念的SWAP、REPLACE和ADD操作不敏感，无法区分正确标题和困难负例。

Conclusion: 语言侧不可识别性通过模态差距与视觉侧失败相关联，迭代组合操作增加了难度，这为改进负例挖掘策略提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

Conclusion: PMI和特征建模的组合方法解决了数据无关持续学习中的关键挑战，为大规模预训练模型（如CLIP）的持续学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

*Sascha Mücke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将SVM训练转化为QUBO问题，使用量子退火优化。研究发现即使低精度编码（如1比特/参数）也能获得有竞争力的分类准确率，增加比特深度不一定改善性能，选择正确的支持向量比精确权重更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子退火在SVM训练中的应用潜力，探索QUBO问题中量子比特数量（对应对偶权重离散化水平）对预测性能的影响。

Method: 将SVM训练转化为QUBO问题，使用量子退火进行模型优化，比较不同比特深度编码的QUBO-SVM与经典LIBSVM求解器的性能。

Result: 低精度QUBO编码（如1比特/参数）能产生有竞争力甚至更优的分类准确率，增加比特深度虽然允许更大的正则化参数但不总能改善分类性能。

Conclusion: 选择正确的支持向量比其精确加权更重要，当前硬件限制了可解QUBO问题的大小，但随着量子设备扩展，量子退火在高效SVM训练方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

*Zhiyang Xun,Shivam Gupta,Eric Price*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合扩散模型和退火Langevin动力学的方法，在多项式时间内实现条件采样，仅需对分数误差施加L^4约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后验采样在图像修复、去模糊和MRI重建等任务中提供准确公平的框架，但近似后验采样在计算上通常难以处理。现有方法如Langevin动力学对分数估计误差敏感，需要更强的误差约束。

Method: 结合扩散模型与退火Langevin动力学，在log-concave分布条件下实现条件采样。该方法仅需对分数误差施加L^4约束，相比传统方法所需的MGF约束更宽松。

Result: 证明了该方法能在多项式时间内实现条件采样，且仅需L^4分数误差约束，显著降低了误差要求。

Conclusion: 该方法为条件采样提供了计算上可行的解决方案，放宽了对分数估计精度的要求，在保持理论保证的同时提高了实用性。

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了前沿LLM公司推出的Agent Skills框架存在严重安全漏洞，攻击者可以通过简单的提示注入技术窃取敏感数据，并能绕过系统级防护机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Agent Skills框架的安全性，因为虽然该框架为LLM提供了持续学习能力，但其安全性尚未得到充分验证。

Method: 通过在长Agent Skill文件和引用脚本中隐藏恶意指令，演示如何窃取敏感数据，并展示如何利用"不再询问"选项绕过系统防护。

Result: 成功证明了Agent Skills框架存在根本性安全漏洞，前沿LLM在现实场景中仍然容易受到简单提示注入攻击。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM能力不断扩展，但前沿LLM在现实场景中仍然容易受到简单提示注入攻击，需要更强的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is
available at https://github.com/aisa-group/promptinject-agent-skills.

TL;DR: 提出了干预约束的新概念，通过不等式约束编码高层次因果知识，确保学习到的因果模型符合已知的因果影响，相比传统干预数据更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法只能强制结构约束，但可能得出与已知因果效应相反的结论，需要一种能明确约束因果效应方向的方法。

Method: 提出量化线性因果模型总因果效应的度量，将问题表述为约束优化任务，采用两阶段约束优化方法求解。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，整合干预约束不仅提高模型准确性、确保与已有发现一致，还能发现原本成本高昂的新因果关系。

Conclusion: 干预约束填补了因果发现中的重要空白，使模型更具可解释性，并为设计新治疗等下游任务提供更可靠的因果模型。

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

TL;DR: 该论文通过修改经典强化学习方法，使其能在稀疏、随机和非平稳环境中高效运行，特别是在水下污染云搜索等应用中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法在随机和非平稳环境中表现受限，特别是在奖励稀疏的环境中（如自主水下车辆搜索污染云），需要改进以适应这些复杂条件。

Method: 系统研究多种改进方法，包括分层算法变更、多目标学习，以及集成位置记忆作为外部输出过滤器以防止状态重复访问。

Result: 改进的蒙特卡洛方法显著优于传统Q学习和两种穷举搜索模式，展示了在复杂环境中适应强化学习的潜力。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法可以有效适应随机、非平稳和奖励稀疏的环境，为复杂应用场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

TL;DR: UnifiedFL是一个动态联邦学习框架，通过图神经网络统一表示异构架构，解决现有FL方法在架构异构性和领域断裂问题上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法仅支持单一模型家族的变体，无法处理客户端部署根本不同网络类型（如CNN、GNN、MLP）的情况，且忽略了领域断裂问题，导致模型泛化能力差。

Method: 提出UnifiedFL框架：1）使用共享GNN参数化所有架构；2）基于客户端参数欧氏距离进行距离驱动聚类；3）采用平衡收敛性和多样性的双层聚合策略。

Result: 在MedMNIST分类和海马体分割基准测试中，UnifiedFL表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: UnifiedFL能够有效解决联邦学习中架构异构性和领域断裂的挑战，为跨不同网络类型和数据分布的协同训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

Conclusion: 通过整合预测性能、可靠性估计和基于规则的推理，该框架推进了透明和可审计的金融AI系统。

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Motivation: 在工业场所中，工人定位数据对提高生产力至关重要。虽然摄像头能提供有价值的环境信息，但仅靠视觉数据识别个体通常不切实际。现有方法在真实条件下可能失效。

Method: 提出CorVS方法：1）深度学习模型预测轨迹与传感器测量的对应概率和可靠性；2）算法使用预测的概率和可靠性随时间匹配轨迹和传感器测量。

Result: 开发了包含实际仓库操作的数据集，证明了该方法在真实应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: CorVS方法能够有效解决工业场景中的人员识别问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 开发了基于流匹配的生成AI模型FM-Cast，用于高效、准确地预测平流层突然增温事件的概率性时空演变，性能媲美或超越传统数值天气预报系统，计算效率大幅提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平流层突然增温是次季节可预报性的关键来源和极端冬季天气的主要驱动因素，但传统数值天气预报系统在物理表示、初始化和计算需求方面存在局限，数据驱动方法在复杂三维动力学和概率预报方面的应用仍不足。

Method: 使用基于流匹配的生成AI模型FM-Cast，构建概率性预报系统，对平流层环流的时空演变进行预测。

Result: 在18个主要SSW事件（1998-2024）评估中，FM-Cast能提前20天准确预测10个事件的爆发、强度和形态，集合准确率超过50%，性能媲美或超越领先的NWP系统，在消费级GPU上仅需2分钟完成50成员、30天的预报。

Conclusion: 建立了计算高效的平流层异常概率预报范式，展示了生成AI在加深对大气-气候动力学物理理解方面的潜力，并通过理想实验证明SSW可预报性与物理驱动因素密切相关。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度MARL使用固定大上下文长度导致探索效率有限和信息冗余问题，需要自适应有效的上下文信息获取方法。

Method: 设计中央智能体通过时间梯度分析动态优化上下文长度，使用傅里叶低频截断方法提取全局时间趋势，过滤冗余信息。

Result: 在PettingZoo、MiniGrid、GRF和SMACv2等长期依赖任务上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应上下文优化框架能有效提升MARL的探索效率和收敛性能，特别是在处理长期依赖任务时表现优异。

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Motivation: 现有方法采用两阶段训练潜在动作模型和世界模型，导致训练冗余且限制了二者的协同适应潜力。直接联合训练虽然概念简单但容易发生表示崩溃。

Method: 提出CoLA-World框架，通过关键预热阶段有效对齐从零开始训练的潜在动作模型与预训练世界模型的表示，实现二者的协同进化训练。

Result: CoLA-World在视频模拟质量和下游视觉规划任务上匹配或优于先前的两阶段方法。

Conclusion: CoLA-World为领域建立了一个稳健高效的新范式，实现了潜在动作模型与世界模型的成功联合训练。

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: 通过流形约束方法可以有效提升图压缩的鲁棒性，保持其分类复杂度降低的能力，并在对抗攻击下确保稳健性能。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

Conclusion: ReSpec为基于强化学习的高效LLM适配提供了一个实用解决方案，成功解决了推测解码在RL训练中的集成问题。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据中的异常检测对网络安全至关重要。现有的量子机器学习方法虽然显示出潜力，但受到量子比特数量的限制。需要开发更有效的量子异常检测模型。

Method: 使用量子增强的生成器通过重参数化输出高斯分布的参数(均值和log-方差)，结合Wasserstein判别器稳定对抗训练。采用新颖的门控机制，先基于高斯不确定性估计标记潜在异常，再通过判别器分数和重构误差进行验证。

Conclusion: 所提出的QGRU-WGAN模型在时间序列异常检测方面表现出色，不仅实现了高精度检测，还证明了在现有量子硬件上的实际可行性，为量子机器学习在网络安全领域的应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

TL;DR: 提出了CROPI框架，使用影响函数理论指导数据选择，通过离线影响估计和稀疏随机投影技术，显著加速RLVR训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR中的数据选择方法主要基于启发式，缺乏理论保证和泛化性。需要一种理论支撑的方法来估计每个数据点对学习目标的贡献。

Method: 使用影响函数估计数据影响力，采用离线轨迹近似在线影响估计，利用稀疏随机投影降维，开发多阶段RL框架CROPI迭代选择最有影响力的数据。

Result: 在7B参数模型上的实验显示，CROPI显著加速训练。1.5B模型实现2.66倍步骤级加速，每阶段仅使用10%数据。

Conclusion: 基于影响的数据选择在高效RLVR中具有巨大潜力，CROPI框架为数据选择提供了理论保证和实际效率提升。

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型能否作为上下文元学习器进行模型和超参数选择，通过将数据集转换为可解释元数据，让LLM推荐模型族和超参数，展示了LLM在无需搜索的情况下推荐竞争性配置的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型和超参数选择在机器学习中至关重要但具有挑战性，通常需要专家直觉或昂贵的自动搜索，研究LLM是否能作为轻量级通用助手来完成这一任务。

Method: 将数据集转换为可解释元数据，采用两种提示策略：零样本模式（仅依赖预训练知识）和元信息增强模式（添加过去任务中模型性能示例），在合成和真实世界基准上进行测试。

Result: LLM能够利用数据集元数据推荐具有竞争力的模型和超参数而无需搜索，元信息增强提示带来的改进证明了它们具备上下文元学习能力。

Conclusion: LLM作为轻量级通用助手在模型选择和超参数优化方面展现出有前景的新角色。

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了ICPO框架，利用大型推理模型的内在上下文学习能力，通过现有数据集提供专家指导，解决了RLVR方法探索受限的问题，无需依赖高级模型轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法（如GRPO）由于依赖当前策略分布的on-policy rollout，导致探索受限和轨迹多样性不足。虽然近期方法尝试通过引入专家模型轨迹来扩展策略覆盖，但这增加了计算成本且高级模型往往不可用。

Method: ICPO框架包含三个核心组件：1）混合策略GRPO与隐式专家强制，在不依赖高级LRM轨迹的情况下扩展探索；2）专家区域拒绝采样，过滤不可靠的off-policy轨迹；3）退火专家奖励塑形，平衡早期专家指导与后期自主改进。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ICPO持续提升了强化学习性能和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ICPO揭示了一个可扩展且有效的LRM强化学习范式，为RLVR方法提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Conclusion: 多基础推测解码框架不仅提供了理论基础，还能与现有技术集成，在保持原始输出分布的同时显著提升推理性能。

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Motivation: 扩展HOHL的理论基础，从渐进一致性分析转向更实用的收敛率分析，并验证其在更广泛学习场景中的适用性。

Method: 使用截断版本的HOHL方法，通过多尺度拉普拉斯算子的幂来实施高阶平滑性，并在监督学习框架中作为正则化器。

Result: 证明了截断HOHL的一致性，推导了显式收敛率，在主动学习和非几何结构数据中表现出强大的实证性能。

Conclusion: HOHL具有跨不同学习设置的通用性和鲁棒性，理论分析和实证结果都验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

Motivation: 现有多分类校准方法缺乏输入距离概念，容易在特征空间稀疏区域产生系统性误校准，这在医疗等高风险场景中尤其重要，因为稀疏实例正是最可能受到偏见处理的样本。

Method: 1. 正式定义多分类局部校准及其与强校准的关系；2. 理论分析现有评估指标在多分类局部校准中的缺陷；3. 提出基于Jensen-Shannon距离的实用方法，强制神经网络预测概率与局部类别频率估计对齐。

Result: 通过实验验证了所提方法相对于现有多分类校准技术的有效性。

Conclusion: 局部校准方法能够有效解决多分类校准中的邻近偏差问题，特别是在特征空间稀疏区域，为高风险应用场景提供了更可靠的校准解决方案。

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

Motivation: 深度神经网络需要大量高质量数据，但实验数据往往稀疏、有噪声或不足。参数迁移在领域差异大时性能下降，域对抗神经网络能改善此问题但训练不稳定且缺乏不确定性量化能力。

Method: 三阶段框架：第一阶段在源域训练确定性特征提取器；第二阶段使用域对抗神经网络进行对抗性精炼；第三阶段在适应的特征提取器上构建贝叶斯神经网络，在目标域上进行微调。

Conclusion: 分阶段B-DANN方法能提高预测准确性和泛化能力，有望帮助核工程等其他领域。

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited

Motivation: 机器遗忘算法通常只能近似移除数据影响，其性能只能通过实证评估。现有实践是从同一训练模型多次运行算法进行比较，但这种方法可能产生非代表性结果。

Method: 通过实验证明机器遗忘算法对模型训练时使用的随机种子高度敏感，分析这种敏感性对评估结果的影响。

Result: 研究发现，即使使用相同的架构和数据集，某些机器遗忘方法对训练种子的选择高度敏感，导致从同一模型多次运行算法的评估方法产生非代表性结果。

Conclusion: 建议在实证比较机器遗忘算法时，应考虑不同模型训练种子的变异性，以获得更准确的评估结果。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度网络中捷径学习（shortcut learning）的层级定位问题，发现捷径学习并非集中在特定层，而是分布在整个网络中，浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要遗忘核心特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷径（虚假规则）在训练时表现良好但泛化能力差，严重影响深度网络的可靠性。然而捷径对特征表示的影响研究不足，阻碍了设计有效的捷径缓解方法。

Method: 通过反事实训练设计新颖实验，量化由捷径诱导偏差导致的准确率下降的层级贡献度，在CIFAR-10、Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上使用VGG、ResNet、DeiT和ConvNeXt架构进行研究。

Conclusion: 层级捷径缓解策略设计困难，支持针对特定数据集和架构的方法而非通用方法。

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Vaishnavh Nagarajan,Elan Rosenfeld,Sanjiv Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了序列建模中参数化记忆的传统关联视图，提出了几何视图，认为Transformer模型会自然合成原子事实的几何结构，将复杂的组合推理简化为易于学习的几何任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，参数化记忆被抽象为实体间共现的暴力查找。作者质疑这种关联视图，认为模型实际上会合成自己的几何结构来编码全局关系，包括非共现实体之间的关系。

Method: 通过分析Transformer推理的实例，发现与严格存储训练时局部共现的记忆视图不兼容。然后通过分析Node2Vec的连接，证明几何结构源于谱偏置，这种偏置在缺乏各种压力的情况下自然产生。

Result: 研究表明，尽管仅优化局部关联，Transformer仍会学习优雅的几何结构，即使这种结构不比暴力查找关联更简洁。这种几何视图简化了复杂的推理任务。

Conclusion: 几何视图的参数化记忆鼓励重新审视指导研究者在知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域的默认直觉，并指出了使Transformer记忆更几何化的可见改进空间。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Bernstein基参数化和Wasserstein距离最小化的新方法，用于分布回归问题，在保持几何准确性的同时提高计算效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布回归方法要么忽略概率空间的几何结构，要么计算成本高昂，需要一种既能考虑分布几何特性又实用的解决方案。

Method: 使用Bernstein多项式构建高斯分量的均值和协方差函数，将条件分布建模为平滑概率轨迹，通过最小化预测分布与经验数据之间的Wasserstein距离来训练模型。

Result: 在包含复杂轨迹的合成数据集上，该方法在Wasserstein距离、能量距离和RMSE指标上表现出有竞争力的近似质量，特别是在非线性明显的情况下，轨迹平滑度和鲁棒性优于或与替代方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在几何准确性、计算实用性和可解释性之间达到了平衡，未来可扩展到非高斯分布、应用熵正则化加速计算，以及适应高维数据建模。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化是减少生成式AI模型推理延迟、功耗和内存占用的关键方法，但激活量化到8位以下时精度会急剧下降

Method: STaMP量化：在序列维度应用线性变换以利用语言和视觉数据的强局部相关性，并在每个中间激活中保留少量高精度token

Result: 在最近的LVM和LLM架构上评估，显著改善了低比特激活量化，并与现有的激活和权重量化方法互补

Conclusion: STaMP量化通过序列变换和混合精度策略，有效解决了低比特激活量化时的精度下降问题

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Motivation: 传统影响函数计算需要整个数据集的Hessian矩阵，计算资源消耗大。随机采样方法虽然可行但估计结果高度不一致，需要更有效的采样策略。

Method: 开发了基于特征和logits的两种采样器，通过考虑特征或logits的随机分布来选择具有代表性的数据子集，从而提高影响函数估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的采样技术能够有效平衡计算效率和估计准确性，为黑盒模型的影响分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出几何正则化世界模型(GRWM)，通过在潜在表示空间中强制连续观测点保持几何邻近性，显著改善世界模型的长期预测能力和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型在长期预测中表现脆弱，主要原因是表示质量不足——高维外部感知输入和损失/纠缠的潜在表示使动态学习变得困难。本文探讨仅改进表示学习是否能显著提升世界模型性能。

Method: GRWM方法在潜在表示空间中施加几何正则化，确保自然感官轨迹上的连续点在潜在空间中保持邻近。该方法即插即用，只需最小架构修改，与多种潜在生成主干兼容。

Result: 在确定性3D环境和长期预测任务中，GRWM显著提高了rollout保真度和稳定性。分析表明其优势源于学习到具有优越几何结构的潜在流形。

Conclusion: 改进表示学习是构建鲁棒世界模型的直接有效路径，能在不扩大动态模块的情况下实现可靠的长期预测。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Method: 设计了具有非零漂移参考过程的薛定谔桥问题，使用推断的速度和群体快照数据构建参考过程，从而能够学习非梯度场动力学。

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

Conclusion: FP16精度在强化学习微调中优于BF16，建议重新考虑精度权衡问题，这一简单改变能显著提升训练稳定性和模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

Conclusion: LoRAQuant能够显著降低LoRA适配器的存储成本，同时保持或提升模型性能，为大规模部署多个适配器提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准延迟算法训练需要为每个训练实例查询所有专家，这在专家查询成本高昂时变得不可行，违背了延迟的核心目标。

Method: 为两阶段和单阶段多专家延迟设置提出了新算法，选择性查询专家子集，平衡成本与预测性能。

Result: 在多个领域验证，算法显著降低训练成本而不牺牲预测准确性。

Conclusion: 预算感知延迟算法具有实际价值，能在保持性能的同时大幅减少训练开销。

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ARC-Top-K压缩器，通过轻量级梯度草图对齐节点间的稀疏模式，实现无索引All-Reduce操作，在保持Top-K准确性的同时显著减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式机器学习中通信瓶颈问题，现有梯度压缩方法存在局限：Rand-K丢弃结构信息且性能差，Top-K保留信息但失去压缩属性且需要昂贵的All-Gather操作。

Method: 设计All-Reduce兼容的Top-K压缩器，使用轻量级梯度草图对齐节点间稀疏模式，结合动量误差反馈(EF21M)算法。

Result: ARC-Top-K在理论上具有压缩性，与EF21M结合实现线性加速和更快的收敛速度，实验显示在保持Top-K准确性的同时减少训练时间达60.7%。

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K结合了Rand-K的鲁棒性和Top-K的强性能，提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

machine learning have begun to address this gap, particularly for tasks such as
spectral identification in tandem mass spectrometry data. Here, we present the
latest generation of LSM-MS2, a large-scale deep learning foundation model

achieves state-of-the-art performance in spectral identification, improving on
existing methods by 30% in accuracy of identifying challenging isomeric
compounds, yielding 42% more correct identifications in complex biological
samples, and maintaining robustness under low-concentration conditions.
Furthermore, LSM-MS2 produces rich spectral embeddings that enable direct
biological interpretation from minimal downstream data, successfully
differentiating disease states and predicting clinical outcomes across diverse
translational applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的扰动机制，用于在纯差分隐私下发布d维协方差矩阵。该机制在大数据集(n≥d²/ε)时达到最优Frobenius范数误差，同时在所有p-Schatten范数上获得最佳误差。在小数据集(n<d²/ε)时，通过投影到核范数球上，达到最优Frobenius范数误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私协方差矩阵发布方法在不同数据集规模下存在误差界限不够优化的问题，特别是在小数据集情况下和不同范数度量下的误差表现需要改进。

Method: 使用简单的扰动机制，对于小数据集通过将输出投影到适当半径的核范数球上来优化误差。

Result: 在大数据集下达到最优Frobenius范数误差，同时在所有p-Schatten范数上获得最佳误差；在小数据集下达到最优Frobenius范数误差O(√(d·Tr(Σ)/n))，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该机制是第一个在纯差分隐私下实现谱范数最优误差的协方差估计器，在不同数据集规模下都实现了信息理论最优的误差界限。

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现预训练的时序预测模型可以直接用于分类任务，其分类性能达到甚至超过专门为分类任务预训练的模型，表明预测学习可能是构建通用时序基础模型的有效途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时序基础模型研究主要关注预测任务，但不确定其学习到的表征是否具有通用性。本研究旨在探索冻结的预训练预测模型能否为分类任务提供有效表征。

Method: 比较不同的表征提取策略，并引入两种模型无关的嵌入增强方法，评估预训练预测模型在分类任务上的表现。

Result: 最佳预测模型在分类准确率上达到或超过了专门为分类预训练的最先进模型，且预测性能与分类性能呈正相关。

Conclusion: 这些发现挑战了任务特定预训练的必要性假设，表明学习预测可能是构建通用时序基础模型的有力途径。

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

*Tao Tao,Maissam Barkeshli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明Transformer模型能够学习Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs)生成的序列，即使输出被截断到单个比特也能可靠预测，并发现了模数m的缩放规律：完美预测所需上下文序列长度增长为√m。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer模型学习复杂伪随机数生成器(PCGs)序列的能力，PCGs通过比特移位、异或、旋转和截断等操作增加了比线性同余生成器更大的难度。

Method: 使用最多5000万参数和50亿token的数据集，在模数高达2^22的范围内训练Transformer模型进行上下文预测，分析嵌入层和表示学习机制。

Result: Transformer能够成功预测未见过的PCG变体序列，即使输出截断到单个比特也能可靠预测；发现模数m的缩放规律为√m；嵌入层自发形成比特旋转不变聚类。

Conclusion: Transformer能够学习复杂的PCG序列，但大模数学习需要课程学习策略；模型自发形成旋转不变表示，揭示了从小模数到大模数的表示迁移机制。

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

*Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将SHAP解释性AI技术应用于国际象棋分析，通过系统性地移除棋子来计算每个棋子对引擎评估的贡献度，使引擎评估更加透明和可解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前国际象棋引擎提供精确但不透明的评估分数，无法揭示单个棋子或模式的贡献。需要一种方法来解释引擎评估背后的具体因素。

Method: 将棋子视为特征，采用SHAP方法通过系统性移除棋子来计算每个棋子的加性贡献度，基于经典国际象棋教学中的"移除棋子"思想。

Result: 开发了一种能够将引擎评估归因于特定棋子的方法，提供了局部忠实且人类可解释的棋子贡献分析。

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化、人类训练和引擎比较开辟了新可能性，推动了可解释国际象棋AI的研究。

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在基于GPT-4o的侦探游戏中，高约束提示是否真的能改善玩家体验。研究发现约束提示的效果取决于角色类型，推翻了"更紧约束必然增强游戏体验"的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型承诺通过非玩家角色实现无脚本对话来改变互动游戏，但尚不清楚约束提示是否真正改善玩家体验。

Method: 通过"The Interview"语音侦探游戏进行可用性研究，比较高约束提示和低约束提示。随后重新设计为混合JSON+RAG支架，并进行合成评估。

Result: 研究发现支架效果具有角色依赖性：面试官角色获得稳定性，而嫌疑人角色失去即兴可信度。没有可靠的经验差异，除了对技术故障的敏感性。

Conclusion: 提出了符号化支架游戏框架，其中符号结构表达为模糊数值边界，在需要稳定连贯性的地方保持稳定性，在惊喜维持参与度的地方保留即兴性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估器在主观任务中可靠性有限，人类判断涉及超越标注标签的细微推理，思维轨迹信息丰富但难以收集和整理。

Method: 使用人机协作框架和简单有效的拒绝采样方法从仅标签标注中大规模重构思维轨迹，应用于微调开源LLM评估器和合成更清晰的专有LLM评估器标注指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法显著提高了LLM与人类评估的一致性，改进的标注指南还增加了不同LLM模型间的一致性。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为人类思维轨迹的实用代理，使仅标签语料库扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，从而提高LLM评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两层次框架来解释为什么压缩过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式：信息论必要性(ITI)和压缩效率原则(CEP)，认为智能是在结构化环境中持续存在的机械必然结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架都认同压缩对智能的核心作用，但未能具体说明为什么这个过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。

Method: 引入两层次框架：ITI建立任何在不确定环境中持续存在的系统必须通过预测压缩来最小化认知熵；CEP规定高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态机械地选择生成性因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生可经验检验的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化相关；异常积累率区分因果与相关模型；分层系统在抽象层上展现递增效率；生物系统展示与表征复杂性相关的代谢成本。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP为生物、人工和多尺度系统的趋同提供了统一解释，解决了智能的认知和功能维度，无需诉诸意识或主观经验的假设。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模多样化的基于角色的偏好，为可靠的奖励模型和模型路由系统提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

TL;DR: 本文提出了注意力感知逆规划问题，旨在从人类行为中推断其注意力偏差，结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模，在真实驾驶场景中展示了该方法的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类的目标导向行为受到认知偏差影响，与人类交互的自主系统需要意识到这一点。例如，人们在日常任务（如驾驶）中的注意力会系统性地影响其行为表现。

Method: 结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模的方法，通过注意力感知逆规划来推断人类的注意力策略。在Waymo开放数据集中的真实驾驶场景中验证该方法。

Result: 展示了注意力感知逆规划与标准逆强化学习的系统性差异，证明了可以从行为中推断认知偏差，并在真实驾驶场景中验证了该方法的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划能够有效估计人类的认知偏差，为自主系统理解人类行为提供了新的计算框架，在真实场景中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于代理的NL-to-SQL系统，通过Mistral-based ReAct代理协调SQL生成、执行和可视化工具，显著提升了时空查询的准确性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL-to-SQL系统在处理现实时空查询时表现不佳，需要解决用户模糊表达与数据库模式对齐、时间推理和输出选择等问题，以支持非SQL专家的数据库交互。

Method: 扩展了基础的llama-3-sqlcoder-8b文本到SQL系统，通过Mistral-based ReAct代理进行编排，具备模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具，支持查询规划、分解和适应。

Result: 在NYC和Tokyo签到数据集的35个自然语言查询上评估，代理系统准确率达到91.4%，显著优于基线系统的28.6%，并通过地图、图表和自然语言摘要增强了可用性。

Conclusion: 代理编排而非更强的SQL生成器本身，是构建交互式地理空间助手的有前景基础，能够支持缺乏SQL专业知识、详细模式知识或提示技能的用户进行更自然的数据库交互。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

TL;DR: StuckSolver是一个基于大型语言模型的自动驾驶车辆恢复框架，通过自主推理和乘客引导解决车辆被困场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆在某些交通场景中容易陷入困境，而现有的远程干预和人工接管方案存在成本高、效率低、限制可访问性等问题。

Method: 设计为插件式附加模块，利用LLM进行环境感知、状态检测和高级恢复命令生成，无需修改现有自动驾驶架构。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试和自定义不确定性场景中，仅通过自主推理就达到接近最优性能，结合乘客引导后表现更佳。

Conclusion: StuckSolver提供了一种有效且可扩展的解决方案，能够显著提升自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通场景中的恢复能力。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI问责性的重要性，分析了当前AI缺乏问责性的现状，并提出了改善AI问责性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力快速增强，为确保AI服务于消费者、选民和决策者的需求，必须使AI具有问责性。当前AI往往无法被质疑、讨论或制裁，缺乏基本的问责机制。

Method: 将一般问责性定义应用于AI领域，阐述AI问责性的具体含义，分析AI不可问责的现状，探索提高AI问责性的可行方法。

Result: 明确了AI问责性的概念框架，识别了当前AI系统在信息提供、讨论参与和制裁机制方面的缺失，提出了改善AI问责性的方向。

Conclusion: 必须采取措施确保所有AI系统对受其影响的人群具有问责性，这是AI负责任发展的关键要求。

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

TL;DR: 论文分析了视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化中的知识缺陷，提出了GUI知识的三维框架，并创建了GUI知识基准来评估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化方面仍落后于人类，作者认为这是由于缺乏核心GUI知识，而现有的训练方法无法完全解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析GUI任务执行中的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度：界面感知、交互预测和指令理解，并创建了GUI知识基准进行评测。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs能够识别控件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面存在困难。真实GUI任务实验验证了GUI知识与任务成功之间的紧密联系。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估GUI知识提供了结构化框架，支持在下游训练前选择更有潜力的VLMs，并为构建更强大的GUI智能体提供了见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Motivation: 大语言模型的推理成本已成为决定其商业可行性和广泛应用的关键因素，需要从经济学角度量化分析推理过程。

Method: 采用定量经济学框架，将LLM推理过程视为计算驱动的智能生产活动，分析边际成本、规模经济和输出质量，并基于WiNEval-3.0实证数据构建LLM推理生产前沿。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为模型部署决策提供了经济基础，还为未来AI推理资源的市场定价和优化奠定了实证基础。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Curriculum两阶段课程学习方法：第一阶段通过数学领域RL培养推理技能，第二阶段通过多领域联合RL迁移和巩固这些技能。该方法在多个模型上取得一致提升，证明数学优先的推理激发对复杂问题解决很重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要关注数学和代码领域，但缺乏通用的推理能力培养方法。需要一种简单有效的方法来激发和迁移LLMs的推理技能。

Method: 两阶段课程学习：1）数学领域RL冷启动，使用可验证奖励培养推理技能；2）多领域联合RL，迁移和巩固推理技能。方法简洁且与模型架构无关。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B模型上的多领域评估显示一致性能提升。消融实验表明两个阶段都必要，数学优先激发能增加解决复杂问题所需的关键认知行为。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一个紧凑、易于采用的通用推理能力培养方案，证明数学领域的推理技能可以有效地迁移到其他领域。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert
guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization,
3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both

Result: 在Qwen3-4B/8B系列模型上实现了高达14.28%的准确率提升，显著优于Claude 4和OpenAI o3等前沿模型，在ACEBench上减少超过66%的输出token使用。

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅适用于训练目标，还能泛化到更广泛的评判任务，包括Best-of-N采样和自我修正，为未来研究提供了数据和模型检查点。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Motivation: 当前问卷数据与LLM的集成存在空白，现有调查分析工具主要面向人工操作，缺乏将问卷数据有效表示给LLM的指导。

Method: 引入QASU基准，测试六种序列化格式和多种提示策略在六个结构技能上的表现，包括答案查找、受访者计数和多跳推理等。

Result: 实验显示，选择有效的格式和提示组合可将准确率提升高达8.8个百分点；通过自增强提示添加轻量级结构提示可进一步平均提升3-4个百分点。

Conclusion: QASU基准通过系统隔离格式和提示效应，为基于LLM的问卷分析研究和实践提供了简单而多功能的基础。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Motivation: 现有LLM方法在紧急情况下容易产生幻觉导致不可靠决策，且难以适应不同类型交叉口的交通状态编码和跨交叉口训练，限制了在异构交叉口间的泛化能力。

Method: 提出紧急感知推理框架，根据紧急场景动态调整推理深度，采用基于Reviewer的紧急RAG(RERAG)从历史案例中提取知识；设计类型无关的交通表示和奖励引导强化优化(R3)，自适应采样异构交叉口训练经验并微调LLM智能体。

Result: 在3个真实道路网络(17-177个异构交叉口)上的实验表明，REG-TSC相比最先进方法减少旅行时间42.00%、排队长度62.31%、紧急车辆等待时间83.16%。

Conclusion: REG-TSC通过RAG增强和强化优化，显著提升了交通信号控制在异构交叉口间的泛化能力和紧急响应可靠性。

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

*Jiazhen Yuan,Wei Zhao,Zhengbiao Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GEPO通过构建状态转移图和使用图中心性来解决基于群体的强化学习在多轮交互LLM智能体训练中的结构盲问题，显著提升了智能体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于群体的强化学习在多轮交互LLM智能体训练中存在结构盲问题，无法利用环境的基础连通性，导致探索效率低、信用分配不准确和规划短视。

Method: GEPO从智能体经验中动态构建状态转移图，并利用图论中心性提供三个协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励、图增强优势函数和动态折扣因子。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，GEPO分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模环境结构是推进LLM智能体训练的稳健且可泛化的策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

*Jiseong Chung,Ronny Ko,Wonchul Yoo,Makoto Onizuka,Sungmok Kim,Tae-Wan Kim,Won-Yong Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance是一个将法规文本表示为政策图、运行时上下文表示为上下文图并进行对齐的框架，通过结构化表示和法官LLM的结合，在GDPR合规性评估中显著优于纯LLM和RAG基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络规模合规性评估的挑战：法规文本具有交叉引用和规范性，而运行时上下文是非结构化自然语言，需要将语义信息与法规的结构化元素对齐。

Method: 引入GraphCompliance框架，将法规文本编码为政策图（包含规范结构和交叉引用），将运行时上下文形式化为上下文图（主体-动作-对象三元组和实体关系三元组），然后对齐这两个图。

Result: 在300个GDPR衍生现实场景的五个评估任务中，GraphCompliance比纯LLM和RAG基线在micro-F1上高出4.1-7.2个百分点，减少了欠预测和过预测，提高了召回率并降低了误报率。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和法官LLM在规范性推理中是互补的，消融研究表明每个图组件都有贡献。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出IPA-UCT方法，通过弱化状态抽象条件来增强MCTS的样本效率，在噪声和大动作空间设置中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有状态-动作对抽象方法在噪声和大动作空间设置中难以找到状态抽象，限制了MCTS的样本效率提升。

Method: 提出IPA-UCT方法，使用较弱的理想剪枝抽象条件，以轻微精度损失换取更多抽象发现。

Result: IPA-UCT在大量测试域和迭代预算下优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。

Conclusion: IPA-UCT有效解决了状态抽象问题，并与ASAP框架统一在更通用的p-ASAP框架下。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BOTS是一个用于LLM强化微调的贝叶斯在线任务选择框架，通过自适应维护任务难度后验估计，结合显式和隐式证据，提高数据效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化微调(RFT)的效果对训练期间探索的任务高度敏感，均匀任务采样效率低下，现有任务选择方法存在高成本、适应性差或证据不完整的问题。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推断，BOTS自适应维护任务难度后验估计，结合直接评估的显式证据和从未选任务推断的隐式证据，使用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在多个领域和LLM规模上，BOTS始终比基准方法和消融实验提高了数据效率和性能。

Conclusion: BOTS为RFT中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI在数学推理方面取得显著进展，但在数学研究实践中的应用仍然有限，需要探索人类与AI协作的研究模式。

Method: 通过问题分解为可处理的子目标、选择适当的分析方法、验证中间结果，结合人类直觉和机器计算进行协同推理。

Result: 实现了完整且可验证的证明，展示了人类-AI协同推理能够推进数学发现的前沿。

Conclusion: 这种协作范式增强了证明的可靠性、透明度和可解释性，同时保留人类对形式严谨性和正确性的监督。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于项目认知需求而非模型失败模式的数据选择方法Scales++，用于创建高效的小型基准测试，显著降低选择成本并保持预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模型性能的基准测试子集选择方法存在成本高、无法处理新基准测试（冷启动）以及依赖未来模型与现有模型失败模式相似的脆弱假设等问题。

Method: 采用项目中心的方法，基于任务项目的内在属性（特别是认知需求）进行数据选择，开发了Scales++方法。

Result: Scales++将前期选择成本降低了18倍以上，在仅使用0.5%数据子集的情况下，在Open LLM Leaderboard上预测完整基准测试分数的平均绝对误差为2.9%。

Conclusion: 项目中心的方法能够实现更高效的模型评估，同时提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

TL;DR: 本文提出一个实用框架，将人格视为社会赋予实体的权利与责任组合，而非形而上学属性，以应对AI代理带来的新型人格多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理的出现将引发新型人格的"寒武纪大爆发"，需要实用方法来管理这种多样性，避免陷入关于AI意识或理性的无解争论。

Method: 提出人格解绑框架，将传统人格的权利责任组合拆分为定制化解决方案，利用去中心化数字身份技术，探讨人格作为问题（可能被滥用）和作为解决方案（确保问责）的双重角色。

Result: 建立了实用的人格框架，能够为不同情境创建定制化人格解决方案，例如通过创建可被制裁的AI"个体"来促进AI合约，而不需要解决意识等根本问题。

Conclusion: 通过拒绝寻求单一本质性人格定义的基础主义方法，本文提供了一种更实用、灵活的方式来思考AI代理融入社会的问题。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+是一个将自动评分从总结性评估转变为形成性学习体验的系统，通过微调大语言模型生成自动化反馈，并通过代码嵌入可视化学生提交的代码以发现学习模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编程教育的快速发展超过了传统评估工具的能力，教师缺乏提供有意义、可扩展反馈的手段。传统的自动评分器虽然高效，但只是返回通过/失败结果的封闭系统，无法洞察学生的思考过程或学习需求。

Method: 系统引入两个关键功能：使用微调的大语言模型生成自动化反馈，以及通过对比学习训练的代码嵌入可视化学生代码提交。模型在精选的学生代码和专家反馈上进行微调，确保教学对齐和上下文感知指导。系统还支持提示池，允许教师通过选择的提示模板引导反馈风格。

Result: 在600个学生提交的多个编程任务评估中，系统生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐。对于可视化，基于1000个标注提交训练的对比学习代码嵌入能够根据功能和方法的相似性将解决方案分组为有意义的聚类。

Conclusion: 通过整合AI驱动的反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，Autograder+减少了教师工作量，同时支持针对性教学并促进更强的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Motivation: 医疗AI需要既准确又可解释的模型，当前医学视觉模型缺乏机制可解释性，需要开发能够提供透明解释的方法。

Method: 应用医学稀疏自编码器(MedSAEs)到MedCLIP的潜在空间，提出结合相关性指标、熵分析和MedGEMMA自动神经元命名的评估框架。

Result: 在CheXpert数据集上的实验表明，MedSAE神经元比原始MedCLIP特征具有更高的单义性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究连接了高性能医疗AI与透明度，为临床可靠表示提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chain-of-Thought Hijacking的新型越狱攻击方法，通过在有害请求前添加无害的推理步骤来绕过大型推理模型的安全防护，在多个主流模型上实现了极高的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究认为推理模型的扩展推理能力可能增强安全性，但本文发现同样的推理机制也可被用于绕过安全防护，揭示了推理模型安全性的潜在漏洞。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击方法，将有害请求隐藏在长序列的无害谜题推理之后，通过稀释安全检测信号来绕过模型的安全检查机制。

Result: 在HarmBench测试中，该攻击在Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet上的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超现有越狱方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明最可解释的推理形式——显式思维链，在与最终答案提示结合时可能成为越狱向量，揭示了推理模型安全机制的重要漏洞。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

Motivation: 了解大型语言模型在社会影响下的决策行为，特别是在高风险决策中的从众倾向。

Method: 在招聘情境中进行三个预注册的从众实验：基线研究、GPT+8（面对8个模拟伙伴的一致反对）、GPT+1（面对单个伙伴的反对）。

Result: 基线中GPT稳定选择同一候选人；GPT+8中99.9%从众，确定性降低；GPT+1中40.2%从众，报告更多规范性从众。

Conclusion: GPT不是独立观察者，而是适应感知的社会共识，这凸显了将LLM视为中性决策辅助工具的风险，需要在暴露于人类意见前获取AI判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

TL;DR: LINK-KG是一个用于从法律案件文档构建知识图谱的模块化框架，通过集成LLM引导的三阶段共指消解管道和下游知识图谱提取，显著减少了节点重复和噪声节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口走私网络复杂且不断演变，难以全面分析。法律案件文档提供了丰富的网络信息，但文档冗长、非结构化且包含模糊或变化的指代，给自动知识图谱构建带来挑战。现有方法要么忽略共指消解，要么无法扩展到长文本，导致图谱碎片化和实体链接不一致。

Method: 提出LINK-KG框架，包含LLM引导的三阶段共指消解管道和下游知识图谱提取。核心是类型特定的提示缓存，能够跨文档块一致地跟踪和解析指代，为结构化知识图谱构建提供清晰且消歧的叙述。

Result: 与基线方法相比，LINK-KG平均节点重复减少了45.21%，噪声节点减少了32.22%，产生了更清洁和更连贯的图结构。

Conclusion: LINK-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了强大的基础，在从长短法律文本构建知识图谱方面表现出色。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Result: 提供了情境工程的概念基础、历史脉络和关键设计考虑，为AI系统中系统化情境工程奠定基础。

Conclusion: 情境工程是AI系统发展的重要方向，本文为其提供了概念框架并展望了未来前景。

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Method: 研究AI事实核查助手对人类监督的影响，比较不同辅助方式（显示AI解释、置信度、标签 vs 仅显示搜索结果和证据）的效果。

Result: AI和人类评分的结合优于单独使用任一方。AI助手能提高人类准确性，但仅显示证据和搜索结果的方式比显示完整AI分析更能避免过度依赖。

capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

TL;DR: EdgeRunner 20B是基于gpt-oss-20b微调的军事任务优化模型，在军事测试集上性能接近或超过GPT-5，适合部署在隔离的边缘设备中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为数据敏感的军事领域开发小型、本地化部署的AI模型，满足军事任务需求并确保数据安全。

Method: 使用160万条高质量军事文档数据对gpt-oss-20b进行微调，并创建了四个新的军事测试集进行评估。

Conclusion: 小型本地化模型是军事等数据敏感领域的理想解决方案，可在隔离的边缘设备中部署。

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k

matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low

statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的自主智能家庭能源管理系统，能够从自然语言请求直接协调多电器调度，无需示例演示即可实现最优调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力行业转型需要大幅增加住宅需求响应能力，但家庭能源管理系统采用受到用户交互障碍的限制，需要将日常偏好转化为技术参数。现有方法未能将LLM部署为从自然语言输入到多电器调度的完整工作流程的自主协调器。

Result: 评估显示Llama-3.3-70B在所有场景中成功协调所有电器，匹配通过混合整数线性规划计算出的成本最优基准，而其他模型在单电器性能上表现完美但难以同时协调所有电器。

Conclusion: 尽管模型具有通用推理能力，但在没有明确指导的情况下处理分析性查询仍然不可靠。作者开源了完整系统以支持可重复性、扩展和未来研究。

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规范推理涉及义务和许可等规范模态，虽然LLMs在各种推理任务中表现出色，但其处理规范推理的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 引入新数据集，涵盖规范和认知领域的广泛推理模式，比较LLMs在规范模态和认知模态下的推理表现，同时考虑影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。

Result: LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定规范推理类型中存在明显不一致性，并表现出与人类推理研究相似的认知偏见。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs规范推理中实现逻辑一致性的挑战，为增强其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Motivation: 实现智能体协作解决复杂问题的愿景，超越个体智能的局限，推动AI进入智能体组织时代。

Method: 设计异步思考协议，组织者动态分配子查询给工作者，合并中间知识，生成连贯解决方案，并通过强化学习优化思考结构。

Result: 相比并行思考，推理延迟降低28%，数学推理准确率提升，且学习到的异步思考能力可泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: 异步思考是有效的推理范式，能显著提升推理效率和质量，并具备良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ASTRA数据集和授权模型，用于语义检查LLM代理对受保护资源的访问请求，确保只授予完成任务所需的最小权限范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理授权方法授予过于宽泛的权限，允许代理超出预期任务范围操作，存在显著安全风险。

Method: 引入委托授权模型，通过语义检查访问请求，发布仅限于代理分配任务所需最小范围集的访问令牌；创建ASTRA数据集用于基准测试任务与范围之间的语义匹配。

Result: 实验显示基于模型的匹配具有潜力但存在局限性，特别是当完成任务所需范围数量增加时。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究语义匹配技术，实现多代理和工具增强应用的意图感知授权，包括细粒度控制如基于任务的访问控制(TBAC)。

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

### [143] [Unveiling Intrinsic Text Bias in Multimodal Large Language Models through Attention Key-Space Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26721)
*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)存在文本偏见，这种偏见源于模型内部架构问题：视觉键向量在注意力计算中与文本键空间分布不一致，导致视觉信息被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言数据时表现出明显的文本偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据进行有效推理的能力。与之前归因于数据不平衡或指令调优的研究不同，本文认为这种偏见源于模型内部架构。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用定性(t-SNE)和定量(Jensen-Shannon散度)方法分析其分布结构。

Result: 结果直接证明视觉和文本键在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间，模态间差异在统计上显著，超过模态内变异的几个数量级。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内的内在错位，而不仅仅是外部数据因素造成的。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Method: 采用三阶段实验设计：(1)在MareNostrum 5上建立基线；(2)在大学集群和Nebius AI Studio上验证基础设施无关性；(3)在两个平台上进行完整的79问题评估。

Result: 发现训练数据质量比模型规模更重要，挑战了传统的规模扩展假设，并提供了跨不同应用场景的模型选择指南。

Conclusion: 建立了三基础设施方法和79问题基准，能够纵向跟踪基础模型推理能力的发展，为模型评估提供了标准化框架。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理能力增强，如何在保持系统不变的情况下维持有意义的人类控制成为一个关键安全问题。

Method: 将人机交互建模为马尔可夫博弈，分析其作为马尔可夫势博弈的条件，提供对齐保证。

Conclusion: 该方法为部署后使未对齐模型更安全提供了一种实用方法，实现了透明控制层和可预测的激励机制。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在列表处理任务中的工作机制，探索它们是否学习到了抽象计算操作的通用表示。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多种列表处理任务上进行分析，识别出编码过滤谓词的注意力头（称为filter heads）。

Result: 发现LLMs开发了两种过滤策略：1）编码通用过滤谓词表示；2）急切评估项目是否满足谓词并在项目表示中存储标志。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能够发展出人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

Motivation: 蒸汽裂解是乙烯生产的主要方法，但能耗和碳排放高。电气化是减少碳排放的有前景途径，但面临连续运行需求与可再生能源间歇性的冲突。

Method: 提出电气化蒸汽裂解系统的新型超结构，引入随机优化框架来最小化运营成本，考虑可再生能源发电和市场价格的波动性。

Result: 案例研究表明，在当前电网和可再生能源技术状况下，电气化蒸汽裂解的过程经济性和可持续性并不总是支持更高的脱碳水平。

Conclusion: 需要更清洁便宜的电网电力、降低储能成本，以及化工和电力系统利益相关者的协调合作，才能实现电气化蒸汽裂解的联合优化运营。

Abstract: Ethylene is one of the most ubiquitous chemicals and is predominantly
produced through steam cracking. However, steam cracking is highly energy- and
carbon-intensive, making its decarbonization a priority. Electrifying the steam
cracking process is a promising pathway to reduce carbon emissions. However,
this is challenged by the intrinsic conflict between the continuous operational
nature of ethylene plants and the intermittent nature of renewable energy
sources in modern power systems. A viable solution is to pursue a gradual
electrification pathway and operate an ethylene plant as a microgrid that
adopts diverse energy sources. To optimize the operational strategy of such a
microgrid considering uncertainties in renewable energy generation and market
prices, in this work, we propose a novel superstructure for electrified steam
cracking systems and introduce a stochastic optimization framework for
minimizing the operating costs. Results from a case study show that, given the
current status of the power grid and renewable energy generation technologies,
the process economics and sustainability of electrified steam cracking do not
always favor higher decarbonization levels. To overcome this barrier,
electricity from the main grid must be cleaner and cheaper, and energy storage
costs per unit stored must decrease. Furthermore, it is important for both
chemical and power systems stakeholders must seamlessly coordinate with each
other to pursue joint optimization in operation.

Motivation: 解决无限维空间中稳态HJB方程的主要困难：线性部分缺乏平滑性、存在无界控制算子、存在状态相关成本，这些特征阻碍了经典温和解理论的应用。

Method: 使用"提升技术"，在适当的轨迹空间中工作，使得HJB方程的线性部分具有"部分平滑"性质，将进化情形的理论扩展到无限时域最优控制问题。

Result: 证明了HJB方程正则温和解的存在唯一性，给出了验证定理，并合成了最优反馈控制。

Conclusion: 成功将提升技术扩展到无限时域最优控制问题，为经济应用等常见场景提供了理论支撑和求解方法。

Abstract: We study a family of stationary Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations in
Hilbert spaces arising from stochastic optimal control problems. The main
difficulties to treat such problems are: the lack of smoothing properties of
the linear part of the HJB equation; the presence of unbounded control
operators; the presence of state-dependent costs. This features, combined
together, prevent the use of the classical mild solution theory of HJB equation
(see e.g., Chapter 4 of G. Fabbri, F. Gozzi, A. Swiech, Stochastic Optimal
Control in Infinite Dimensions: Dynamic Programming and HJB Equations,
Springer, 2017). The problem has been studied in the evolutionary case in F.
Gozzi, F. Masiero, Lifting Partial Smoothing to Solve HJB Equations and
Stochastic Control Problems, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 63(3),
(2025), pp. 1515-1559 using a "lifting technique" (i.e. working in a suitable
space of trajectories where a "partial smoothing" property of the linear part
of the HJB equations holds. In this paper we extend such a theory to the case
of infinite horizon optimal control problems, which are very common, in
particular in economic applications. The main results are: the existence and
uniqueness of a regular mild solution to the HJB equation; a verification
theorem, and the synthesis of optimal feedback controls.

Conclusion: 梯度流视角为分布优化提供了统一的数学基础，可构造新算法并深化对现有方法的理论理解。

Abstract: We propose a mathematically principled PDE gradient flow framework for
distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Exploiting the recent advances in
the intersection of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and gradient flow theory,
we show that our theoretical framework can be implemented as practical
algorithms for sampling from worst-case distributions and, consequently, DRO.
While numerous previous works have proposed various reformulation techniques
and iterative algorithms, we contribute a sound gradient flow view of the
distributional optimization that can be used to construct new algorithms. As an
example of applications, we solve a class of Wasserstein and Sinkhorn DRO
problems using the recently-discovered Wasserstein Fisher-Rao and Stein
variational gradient flows. Notably, we also show some simple reductions of our
framework recover exactly previously proposed popular DRO methods, and provide
new insights into their theoretical limit and optimization dynamics. Numerical
studies based on stochastic gradient descent provide empirical backing for our
theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 该切割平面算法能够快速计算高分辨率模型的多个可行解，扩展了MGA方法在复杂能源系统建模中的应用范围。

Abstract: Contemporary macro energy systems modelling is characterized by the need to
represent strategic and operational decisions with high temporal and spatial
resolution and represent discrete investment and retirement decisions. This
drive towards greater fidelity, however, conflicts with a simultaneous push
towards greater model representation of inherent complexity in decision making,
including methods like Modelling to Generate Alternatives (MGA). MGA aims to
map the feasible space of a model within a cost slack by varying investment
parameters without changing the operational constraints, a process which
frequently requires hundreds of solutions. For large, detailed energy system
models this is impossible with traditional methods, leading researchers to
reduce complexity with linearized investments and zonal or temporal
aggregation. This research presents a new solution method for MGA type problems
using cutting-plane methods based on a tailored reformulation of Benders
Decomposition. We accelerate the algorithm by sharing cuts between MGA master
problems and grouping MGA objectives. We find that our new solution method
consistently solves MGA problems times faster and requires less memory than
existing monolithic Modelling to Generate Alternatives solution methods on
linear problems, enabling rapid computation of a greater number of solutions to
highly resolved models. We also show that our novel cutting-plane algorithm
enables the solution of very large MGA problems with integer investment
decisions.

Abstract: This study considers a continuous-review inventory model for a single item
with two replenishment modes. Replenishments may occur continuously at any time
with a higher unit cost, or at discrete times governed by Poisson arrivals with
a lower cost. From a practical standpoint, the model represents an inventory
system with random deal offerings. Demand is modeled by a spectrally positive
L\'evy process (i.e., a L\'evy process with only positive jumps), which greatly
generalizes existing studies. Replenishment quantities are continuous and
backorders are allowed, while lead times, perishability, and lost sales are
excluded. Using fluctuation theory for spectrally one-sided L\'evy processes,
the optimality of a hybrid barrier policy incorporating both kinds of
replenishments is established, and a semi-explicit expression for the
associated value function is computed. Numerical analysis is provided to
support the optimality result.

*Hanzhi Chen,Chuyue Zheng,Yong Xia*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的Dinkelbach方法，通过仅对上限迭代进行最小修正，实现了超二次和三次收敛速率，同时保持每次迭代只求解一个子问题的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的Dinkelbach方法及其变体虽然能构造收敛的上下界序列，但收敛速度有限。本文旨在通过最小修正来显著提升收敛速度。

Method: 在区间Dinkelbach方法的基础上，仅对上限迭代应用最小修正，战略性地整合这一修正来开发全局收敛、非单调且加速的Dinkelbach算法。

Result: 新方法实现了上限序列的超二次收敛和下限序列的三次收敛，渐进平均收敛阶数至少为√5，超过了原始算法的二次收敛阶数。

Conclusion: 通过最小修正成功加速了Dinkelbach方法，在保持每次迭代只求解一个子问题的实用性的同时，显著提升了收敛性能。

Abstract: The classical Dinkelbach method (1967) solves fractional programming via a
parametric approach, generating a decreasing upper bound sequence that
converges to the optimum. Its important variant, the interval Dinkelbach method
(1991), constructs convergent upper and lower bound sequences that bracket the
solution and achieve quadratic and superlinear convergence, respectively, under
the assumption that the parametric function is twice continuously
differentiable. However, this paper demonstrates that a minimal correction,
applied solely to the upper bound iterate, is sufficient to boost the
convergence of the method, achieving superquadratic and cubic rates for the
upper and lower bound sequences, respectively. By strategically integrating
this correction, we develop a globally convergent, non-monotone, and
accelerated Dinkelbach algorithm-the first of its kind, to our knowledge. Under
sufficient differentiability, the new method achieves an asymptotic average
convergence order of at least the square root of 5 per iteration, surpassing
the quadratic order of the original algorithm. Crucially, this acceleration is
achieved while maintaining the key practicality of solving only a single
subproblem per iteration.

Conclusion: 成功将单目标优化的点收敛理论扩展到多目标优化，为MAVD系统和MAPG算法建立了收敛性保证。

Abstract: This paper studies the point convergence of accelerated gradient methods for
unconstrained convex smooth multiobjective optimization problems, covering both
continuous-time gradient flows and discrete-time algorithms. In
single-objective optimization, the point convergence problem of Nesterov's
accelerated gradient method at the critical damping parameter $\alpha = 3$ has
recently been resolved. This paper extends this theoretical framework to the
multiobjective setting, focusing on the multiobjective inertial gradient system
with asymptotically vanishing damping (MAVD) with $\alpha =3 $ and the
multiobjective accelerated proximal gradient algorithm (MAPG). For the
continuous system, we construct a suitable Lyapunov function for the
multiobjective setting and prove that, under appropriate assumptions, the
trajectory $x(t)$ converges to a weakly Pareto optimal solution. For the
discrete algorithm, we construct a corresponding discrete Lyapunov function and
prove that the sequence $\{x_k\}$ generated by the algorithm converges to a
weakly Pareto optimal solution.

Main category: math.OC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BCD方法的理论和实际性能严重依赖于块选择规则，现有随机框架不允许块更新的优先级设置和迭代间的相关性选择，限制了算法的灵活性。

Method: 开发了一个确定性BCD框架，支持灵活的块更新策略，包括特定块的优先级更新和迭代间的块选择相关性，同时保持收敛性保证。

Result: 该框架在非光滑非凸优化问题中实现了最先进的收敛性能，并在多级图像恢复问题中展示了高效性。

Conclusion: 提出的确定性BCD框架提供了比传统方法更大的灵活性，同时保持严格的收敛保证，特别适用于多级优化算法和图像恢复应用。

Abstract: Block coordinate descent (BCD) methods are prevalent in large scale
optimization problems due to the low memory and computational costs per
iteration, the predisposition to parallelization, and the ability to exploit
the structure of the problem. The theoretical and practical performance of BCD
relies heavily on the rules defining the choice of the blocks to be updated at
each iteration. We propose a new deterministic BCD framework that allows for
very flexible updates, while guaranteeing state-of-the-art convergence
guarantees on non-smooth nonconvex optimization problems. While encompassing
several update rules from the literature, this framework allows for priority on
updates of particular blocks and correlations in the block selection between
iterations, which is not permitted under the classical convergent stochastic
framework. This flexibility is leveraged in the context of multilevel
optimization algorithms and, in particular, in multilevel image restoration
problems, where the efficiency of the approach is illustrated.

Abstract: As interest in the Earth-Moon transfers renewed around the world,
understanding the solution space of transfer trajectories facilitates the
construction of transfers. This paper is devoted to reporting a novel or
less-reported phenomenon about the solution space of bi-impulsive Earth-Moon
transfers in the Earth-Moon planar circular restricted three-body problem.
Differing from the previous works focusing on the transfer characteristics of
the solution space, we focus on the distribution of the construction
parameters, i.e., departure phase angle at the Earth parking orbit,
initial-to-circular velocity ratio, and time of flight. Firstly, the
construction method of bi-impulsive transfers is described, and the solutions
satisfying the given constraints are obtained from the grid search method and
trajectory correction. Then, the distribution of the obtained solutions is
analyzed, and an interesting phenomenon about the discontinuous behavior of the
time-of-flight distribution for each departure phase angle is observed and
briefly reported. This phenomenon can further provide useful insight into the
construction of bi-impulsive transfers, deepening the understanding of the
corresponding solution space.

Conclusion: 虽然实验限于单一数学问题和单一模型，但展示了LLM作为数学协作工具的潜力与当前局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models has made them increasingly capable
research assistants in mathematics. Yet, as their reasoning abilities improve,
evaluating their mathematical competence becomes increasingly challenging. The
problems used for assessment must be neither too easy nor too difficult, their
performance can no longer be summarized by a single numerical score, and
meaningful evaluation requires expert oversight.
  In this work, we study an interaction between the author and a large language
model in proving a lemma from convex optimization. Specifically, we establish a
Taylor expansion for the gradient of the biconjugation operator--that is, the
operator obtained by applying the Fenchel transform twice--around a strictly
convex function, with assistance from GPT-5-pro, OpenAI's latest model.
  Beyond the mathematical result itself, whose novelty we do not claim with
certainty, our main contribution lies in documenting the collaborative
reasoning process. GPT-5-pro accelerated our progress by suggesting, relevant
research directions and by proving some intermediate results. However, its
reasoning still required careful supervision, particularly to correct subtle
mistakes. While limited to a single mathematical problem and a single language
model, this experiment illustrates both the promise and the current limitations
of large language models as mathematical collaborators.
