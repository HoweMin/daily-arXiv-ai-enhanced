TL;DR: 开发了一个多级电力负荷预测系统，将区域级预测扩展到节点级，提高预测准确性和可解释性，帮助电网运营商更好地管理电力负荷不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可持续能源发展增加了电力负荷的不确定性，输电系统运营商需要更高空间分辨率的负荷预测，从区域级扩展到节点级，但节点负荷预测准确性较低且管理困难。

Method: 设计多级预测系统，使用可解释和可扩展的预测模型，通过完全并行化的单模型预测工作流，逐步将区域级操作扩展到包含节点预测。

Result: 区域预测的准确性和可解释性得到改善，节点预测有显著改进，运营商能够以前所未有的信心和准确性调整预测，并精确诊断不透明的错误。

Conclusion: 多级预测系统有效解决了节点负荷预测的挑战，为电网运营商提供了更可靠和可管理的负荷预测工具。

Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by
sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty.
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial
resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

### [2] [TangledFeatures: Robust Feature Selection in Highly Correlated Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15005)
*Allen Daniel Sunny*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TangledFeatures框架，用于在相关特征空间中进行特征选择，通过识别纠缠预测因子组中的代表性特征来减少冗余，同时保留解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法主要关注预测准确性，但在存在相关预测因子的情况下性能会下降，需要一种能够处理相关特征空间的方法。

Method: TangledFeatures框架识别纠缠预测因子组中的代表性特征，减少冗余同时保持解释能力，所选特征子集可直接应用于下游模型。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide数据集上应用该框架预测骨架扭转角，所选特征对应于结构上有意义的原子间距离，能够解释这些角度的变化。

Conclusion: TangledFeatures提供了一种比传统选择技术更可解释和稳定的分析基础，有效处理相关特征空间中的特征选择问题。

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both
predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

### [3] [ES-C51: Expected Sarsa Based C51 Distributional Reinforcement Learning Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15006)
*Rijul Tandon,Peter Vamplew,Cameron Foale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的C51分布强化学习算法ES-C51，用Expected Sarsa更新替代贪婪Q学习更新，通过softmax结合所有动作信息，解决了当动作具有相似期望奖励时分布学习不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于值的RL算法只估计期望奖励，而分布强化学习估计奖励的完整概率分布。C51是流行的离散动作空间DRL算法，但使用贪婪Bellman更新可能导致当多个动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时，算法无法学习稳定分布。

Method: 提出ES-C51算法，用Expected Sarsa更新替代C51的贪婪Q学习更新。Expected Sarsa使用softmax计算结合状态所有可能动作的信息，而不是依赖单一最佳动作。同时将标准C51的探索策略从ε-greedy改为softmax作为对比基线QL-C51。

Result: 在Gym经典控制环境和Atari-10游戏中评估，结果表明ES-C51在多个环境中优于QL-C51。

Conclusion: ES-C51通过Expected Sarsa更新有效解决了C51在动作具有相似期望奖励时的分布学习不稳定问题，能够学习到更高性能的策略。

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于集成深度学习的无监督异常检测框架，用于风力涡轮机的早期故障检测，在真实世界数据上实现了0.947的AUC-ROC和最多48小时的提前故障检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机可靠性对可再生能源行业至关重要，早期故障检测能显著减少停机时间和维护成本。

Method: 集成变分自编码器(VAE)、LSTM自编码器和Transformer架构，结合特征工程提取时域、统计和频域指标，通过集成评分和自适应阈值进行无监督异常检测。

Result: 在包含89年真实涡轮机数据的CARE数据集上评估，AUC-ROC达到0.947，能够提前48小时检测到故障。

Conclusion: 该方法通过实现预测性维护，减少涡轮机故障，提高大规模风能部署的运营效率，具有重要的社会价值。

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in
large-scale wind energy deployments.

### [5] [AlignFlow: Improving Flow-based Generative Models with Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15038)
*Lingkai Kong,Molei Tao,Yang Liu,Bryan Wang,Jinmiao Fu,Chien-Chih Wang,Huidong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AlignFlow是一种基于半离散最优传输(SDOT)的流生成模型训练方法，通过将噪声空间划分为Laguerre单元并与数据点建立显式最优对齐，提高训练效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于最优传输的流生成模型方法使用小批量样本估计传输方案，在大规模高维数据集上扩展性受限。需要一种更高效、可扩展的最优传输方法来改进流生成模型的训练。

Method: 利用半离散最优传输(SDOT)将噪声分布划分为Laguerre单元，每个单元映射到对应的数据点，在训练过程中通过SDOT映射将独立同分布的噪声样本与数据点配对。

Result: AlignFlow能够扩展到大型数据集和模型架构，计算开销可忽略，显著提升了多种最先进流生成模型算法的性能，可作为即插即用组件集成。

Conclusion: AlignFlow通过半离散最优传输实现了噪声与数据之间的显式最优对齐，为流生成模型训练提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

*Abdul Samad Khan,Nouhaila Innan,Aeysha Khalique,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了IQNN-CS框架，这是一个用于多类别信用风险分类的可解释量子神经网络，结合了变分量子神经网络和专为结构化数据设计的解释技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习在金融服务中具有潜力，但其黑盒特性阻碍了在需要透明度和信任的信用评分领域的应用。

Method: 使用变分量子神经网络架构，并引入了Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA)指标来量化不同预测类别间的归因差异。

Result: 在两个真实信用数据集上的评估显示，IQNN-CS具有稳定的训练动态、有竞争力的预测性能和增强的可解释性。

Conclusion: 为金融决策中的透明和可问责量子机器学习模型提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world
credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive
predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a
practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial
decision-making.

### [7] [Internalizing World Models via Self-Play Finetuning for Agentic RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15047)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPA框架通过自监督预训练学习世界模型，然后用于策略优化，显著提升LLM智能体在分布外环境中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在分布外环境中表现不佳，难以将内部知识与环境动态对齐，传统强化学习训练效果有限

Method: 将世界模型分解为状态表示和转移建模，通过自博弈监督微调学习世界模型，然后在策略优化前用其模拟未来状态

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和Sudoku等环境中显著提升性能，Sokoban成功率从25.6%提升至59.8%，FrozenLake得分从22.1%提升至70.9%

Conclusion: 为LLM智能体配备内部世界模型能更好地对齐推理与环境动态，大幅改善决策能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

### [8] [Learn to Change the World: Multi-level Reinforcement Learning with Model-Changing Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15056)
*Ziqing Lu,Babak Hassibi,Lifeng Lai,Weiyu Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了多层级可配置时变马尔可夫决策过程（MCTVMDP），其中智能体不仅可以通过底层动作与环境交互，还能通过上层动作主动修改环境动态模型本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习假设环境固定不变，但实际中智能体可能通过主动改变环境动态来获得更高奖励。本文研究智能体如何通过模型修改动作来重构环境动态。

Method: 引入MCTVMDP框架，包含上层配置策略和下层原始动作策略。上层动作可修改下层MDP的非平稳转移函数，智能体需要联合优化两个层级的策略。

Result: 提出了一个能够建模智能体主动修改环境动态的理论框架，为研究可配置环境中的强化学习问题奠定了基础。

Conclusion: MCTVMDP框架扩展了传统强化学习范式，允许智能体通过主动修改环境动态来提升长期奖励，为更灵活的智能体-环境交互提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

### [9] [Antislop: A Comprehensive Framework for Identifying and Eliminating Repetitive Patterns in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15061)
*Samuel Paech,Allen Roush,Judah Goldfeder,Ravid Shwartz-Ziv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Antislop框架通过采样器、自动化流水线和FTPO微调方法，有效检测和消除LLM输出中的重复短语模式，在保持模型性能的同时显著减少slop现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM广泛采用导致输出中出现特征性的重复短语模式（slop），这降低了输出质量并使AI生成文本容易被识别。

Method: 结合三种创新方法：Antislop采样器（使用回溯抑制不想要的字符串）、自动化流水线（分析模型特定slop并生成训练数据）、FTPO微调方法（在单个token级别调整logits）。

Result: 成功抑制8000+个slop模式，FTPO实现90%的slop减少，在GSM8K、MMLU和创意写作任务中保持或提升性能，而DPO方法会导致写作质量和词汇多样性显著下降。

Conclusion: Antislop框架能有效解决LLM输出中的slop问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著改善文本质量。

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results
under MIT license: https://github.com/sam-paech/auto-antislop.

*Sixian Jia,Zhiqiao Dong,Chenhui Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种用于准确及时监测双光子光刻(TPL)系统健康状态的方法，通过结合物理信息数据驱动预测模型和统计方法，能够处理不同泛化水平的复杂场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TPL系统的维护实践主要依赖经验而非基于机器健康状态的监控，导致维护时机不当：要么维护不及时造成机器停机和制造质量差，要么不必要维护导致效率低下和可避免的停机时间。

Method: 提出了三种方法：集成物理信息数据驱动预测模型与统计方法，能够处理不同泛化水平的复杂场景。收集了包含六种工艺参数组合和六种结构尺寸在两种机器健康状态下的综合实验数据集进行评估。

Result: 在所有测试场景中，所提出的方法都实现了高精度，表现出优异的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这些结果代表了向TPL系统基于状态的维护迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

Conclusion: 这是实现机械通气优化和个性化的重要一步，结合经验和博弈论元素构建决策模拟模型

Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in
critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator
systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This
research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

### [12] [Online Correlation Clustering: Simultaneously Optimizing All $\ell_p$-norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15076)
*Sami Davies,Benjamin Moseley,Heather Newman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个在线相关聚类算法，能在单个聚类中同时近似所有ℓ_p-范数目标，在AOS模型下实现O(log⁴n)竞争比，填补了离线与在线设置之间的理论鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于探索是否能在在线设置中实现离线环境下的"全范数"保证，即用单个聚类同时优化总分歧（ℓ₁-范数）和个体公平性（ℓ∞-范数），并揭示标准随机顺序在线模型中这些目标之间的根本分离。

Method: 提出了一种在线带样本（AOS）模型的单一算法，利用输入的一小部分常数比例作为样本，生成一个聚类，该聚类能同时为所有ℓ_p-范数提供有竞争力的近似保证。

Result: 算法在AOS模型中：对所有ℓ_p-范数高概率实现O(log⁴n)竞争比；对ℓ∞-范数高概率实现O(logn)竞争比；对ℓ₁-范数期望实现O(1)竞争比。同时证明了标准RO模型中ℓ∞-范数至少需要Ω(n¹/³)竞争比。

Conclusion: 成功将离线"全范数"保证迁移到在线世界，证明了AOS模型的有效性，并通过下界分析表明所获竞争比在AOS模型中接近最优。

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

### [13] [Policy Transfer Ensures Fast Learning for Continuous-Time LQR with Entropy Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15165)
*Xin Guo,Zijiu Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次为连续时间强化学习提供了策略迁移的理论证明，证明了在连续时间LQR问题中，从一个任务的最优策略可以作为相关任务的近最优初始化，同时保持原始算法的收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在复杂任务上从头训练效率低下，而迁移学习在大语言模型中已证明有效。本文旨在探索如何通过预训练模型提升强化学习效率，特别是在连续时间设置中填补现有文献的空白。

Method: 研究策略迁移方法，在连续时间线性二次调节器（LQR）框架下，使用熵正则化，并提出了新的策略学习算法。

Result: 证明了策略迁移在连续时间RL中的有效性，提出的新算法实现了全局线性和局部超线性收敛，并通过与LQR的连接推导了连续时间扩散模型的稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究为连续时间强化学习中的迁移学习提供了理论保证和算法优势，将先前工作从离散时间扩展到连续时间设置。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long,
physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative,
enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO
approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency
studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to
attention-based or convolutional regressors.

TL;DR: DLER通过改进强化学习优化方法，使用简单的截断长度惩罚，在保持高准确率的同时显著缩短输出长度，实现了最优的准确率-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理语言模型虽然性能强大，但经常生成不必要的冗长输出。如何最大化每个token的智能度（准确率相对于响应长度）是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 提出DLER训练方法，结合批量奖励归一化、更高裁剪、动态采样和简单截断长度惩罚，解决强化学习中的优势估计偏差、熵崩溃和稀疏奖励信号问题。

Result: DLER将输出长度减少70%以上，同时超越所有先前基线的准确率。DLER-7B相比DeepSeek-R1-7B，并行生成多个简洁响应时准确率提高28%且延迟更低。

Conclusion: DLER展示了通过改进强化学习优化而非复杂惩罚机制，可以有效实现准确率与效率的最佳平衡，并提出了难度感知DLER和更新选择性合并方法以进一步提升效率。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Motivation: 现有算子学习方法忽略了PDE的领域知识，导致难以捕捉时间动态且在训练时间范围外泛化能力差

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构：编码器空间离散化输入函数，神经ODE捕捉潜在时间动态，解码器重构物理空间解；提出物理编码的神经ODE

Result: 在非线性扩散-反应方程和Navier-Stokes方程上的数值实验展示了高精度、计算效率和超出训练时间范围的预测能力

Conclusion: 该框架能够适应不同的编码器/解码器，并能跨相关PDE族泛化，展示了其作为可扩展、物理编码的科学机器学习工具的潜力

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a
scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.

Result: 在大型传输系统上的实验显示，混合求解器具有高度可扩展性，相比并行化单纯形求解器实现1000倍以上加速，同时保证最大最优性差距不超过2%

Conclusion: 该混合方法在速度和最优性之间实现了可解释的权衡，为优化代理在实际部署中提供了可信保障

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

*Alex Shtoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图拉普拉斯算子的非参数概率质量函数估计方法，通过数据相关的低通滤波处理多模态和重尾分布，计算可靠且速度快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大规模离散支撑集上多模态和重尾概率质量函数的非参数估计问题，传统方法在处理噪声和保持粗粒度结构方面存在挑战。

Method: 将经验PMF视为线图上的信号，构建对称三对角算子（路径图拉普拉斯加上经验PMF构建的对角矩阵），计算最小特征值对应的特征向量，将经验PMF投影到低维子空间，最后进行裁剪和重归一化处理。

Result: 在合成和真实重尾数据上，该方法能有效保持粗粒度结构同时抑制采样噪声，在目标场景下优于logspline和高斯KDE基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现简洁、计算可靠、运行速度快，适合自动化流程和大规模探索性分析，但存在已知的失效模式（如突变不连续性）。

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究恐怖主义事件周计数的短期预测，使用全球恐怖主义数据库(GTD)数据，旨在建立一个可重复的预测管道并提供基准参考。

Method: 构建可重复预测管道，使用固定时间分割，评估双向LSTM(BiLSTM)模型，并与季节性朴素、线性/ARIMA模型以及LSTM-Attention基线进行比较。

Result: BiLSTM在测试集上表现最佳，RMSE为6.38，相比LSTM-Attention提升30.6%，相比线性滞后回归基准提升35.4%。MAE和MAPE指标也有并行改进。

Conclusion: 研究表明：使用长历史数据训练的模型泛化能力最好；中等回望期(20-30周)提供强上下文；双向编码对捕捉窗口内的累积和后续模式至关重要；短期结构特征贡献最大。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

Motivation: 神经网络在训练过程中如何调整内部表示的特征学习机制仍然缺乏理论理解，需要开发可处理的数学框架来分析这一过程。

Method: 使用统计物理方法推导了贝叶斯后验的自洽均值场理论，针对使用随机梯度Langevin动力学训练的两层非线性网络，并引入了自增强输入特征选择机制来改进理论。

Result: 在无限宽度下理论退化为核岭回归，但在有限宽度下预测到对称性破缺相变，网络会突然与目标函数对齐。改进后的理论能够定量匹配SGLD训练网络的学习曲线。

Conclusion: 均值场理论为有限宽度机制下的特征学习提供了理论洞察，自增强输入特征选择是特征学习的关键机制，改进后的理论能够定量描述网络的学习行为。

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and
provides mechanistic insight into FL.

Conclusion: 测地线问题是深度Ritz方法的一个有前景的应用方向，也是未来科学机器学习研究的一个富有成果的方向。

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

Motivation: 传统髋部骨折风险评估工具如DXA T-score和FRAX缺乏敏感性，容易漏诊高风险个体，特别是那些没有既往骨折或骨量减少的患者。

Method: 使用MrOS、SOF和UK Biobank数据，构建两阶段模型：第一阶段使用临床、人口统计学和功能变量进行筛查，第二阶段整合DXA衍生特征进行精细化预测。

Result: 经过内部和外部验证，该模型在不同队列中表现一致且适应性强，相比T-score和FRAX实现了更高的敏感性和更少的漏诊病例。

Conclusion: 该两阶段框架提供了一种成本效益高且个性化的早期髋部骨折风险评估方法。

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher
sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and
personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mahalanobis距离方法在OOD检测中广泛应用，但表示几何和归一化对其性能的影响尚未完全理解，这限制了其下游应用。

Method: 进行了全面的实证研究，涵盖多种图像基础模型、数据集和距离归一化方案；提出了径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法，通过可调参数直接控制特征空间的径向几何。

Result: 分析表明Mahalanobis方法并非普遍可靠；谱和内在维度指标能准确预测模型的OOD性能；径向缩放ℓ2归一化能显著提升OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过连接表示几何、归一化和OOD性能之间的差距，为设计更有效可靠的深度学习模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly
improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation
geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights
into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估模型主要回答的指令遵循能力，但推理过程中的指令遵循同样重要，能提高模型的可控性、透明度，并减少推理过程中的不良行为。

Method: 构建ReasonIF基准，包含多语言推理、格式和长度控制等六类指令提示，评估多个开源大型推理模型，并探索多轮推理和推理指令微调两种改进策略。

Result: 当前模型在推理指令遵循方面表现不佳，最高指令遵循得分低于0.25，且任务难度增加时表现进一步下降。推理指令微调将GPT-OSS-20B的得分从0.11提升到0.27。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循指令的能力存在显著不足，推理指令微调等策略能带来改进，但仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

Motivation: 研究为什么不同基础模型在RLVR强化学习后推理性能差异巨大，探索预训练模型的微观特性如何影响推理能力。

Method: 将推理形式化为Horn子句链，使用跨层稀疏自编码器提取特征，通过LLM评估规则语义可靠性，并引入SAL指标量化模型对规则可靠性的区分能力。

Result: 发现高性能模型具有内在的可靠性感知能力，其内部概率分布在严格规则和噪声规则间显著区分，而弱模型则无法区分。SAL指标能准确预测模型在RLVR后的推理性能（R^2=0.87）。

Conclusion: 模型的推理潜力与其预训练阶段区分可靠知识和不可靠知识的内在能力密切相关，SAL指标为选择和设计更强基础模型提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

### [29] [Machine Learning for Early Detection of Meningitis: Stacked Ensemble Learning with EHR data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15218)
*Han Ouyang,Jesse Hamilton,Saeed Amal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究使用MIMIC-III数据库，通过集成学习方法开发脑膜炎诊断模型，在模拟急诊室场景下取得了优异的诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够在真实急诊场景中应用的脑膜炎AI诊断工具，解决临床诊断挑战。

Method: 使用214例脑膜炎患者和46,303例非脑膜炎患者数据，经过数据预处理和两阶段特征选择，采用随机森林、LightGBM和深度神经网络作为基础模型，通过集成学习（堆叠逻辑回归作为元模型）构建诊断模型。

Result: 集成模型在两个测试集上分别获得0.9637和0.9472的AUC值，表现出优秀的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 虽然直接将诊断工具部署给临床医生使用仍具挑战性，但该研究为未来基于集成学习的脑膜炎AI诊断方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

*Patricia Medina,Rasika Karkare*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过将产品系数与自编码器表示和KNN分类器结合，在3D LiDAR点云分类中实现了比PCA基线和先前框架更一致的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展先前关于使用产品系数增强3D LiDAR点云分类的研究，探索结合自编码器表示是否能进一步提升性能。

Method: 将产品系数与自编码器表示结合，使用KNN分类器，并逐级添加产品系数来研究其对分类性能的影响。

Result: 逐级添加产品系数显示出清晰趋势：更丰富的系数集合系统性地提高了类别可分性和整体准确率。

Conclusion: 结合分层产品系数特征与自编码器对提升LiDAR分类性能具有重要价值。

Abstract: This work extends our previous study on enhancing 3D LiDAR point-cloud
classification with product coefficients
\cite{medina2025integratingproductcoefficientsimproved}, measure-theoretic
descriptors that complement the original spatial Lidar features. Here, we show
that combining product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a
KNN classifier delivers consistent performance gains over both PCA-based
baselines and our earlier framework. We also investigate the effect of adding
product coefficients level by level, revealing a clear trend: richer sets of
coefficients systematically improve class separability and overall accuracy.
The results highlight the value of combining hierarchical product-coefficient
features with autoencoders to push LiDAR classification performance further.

### [31] [Stress-Aware Learning under KL Drift via Trust-Decayed Mirror Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15222)
*Gabriel Nixon Raj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出熵正则化信任衰减方法，通过应力感知指数倾斜处理分布漂移下的序贯决策问题，实现动态遗憾保证和鲁棒性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分布漂移下的序贯决策问题，传统方法在动态环境中表现不佳，需要开发能够适应分布变化的鲁棒算法。

Method: 采用熵正则化信任衰减，在信念更新和镜像下降决策中注入应力感知指数倾斜，建立Fenchel对偶等价关系，并分析鲁棒性指标如脆弱性、信念带宽和决策空间脆弱指数。

Result: 证明了高概率敏感性边界，在KL漂移路径长度S_T下获得O(√T)的动态遗憾保证，信任衰减实现O(1)的每切换遗憾，而无应力更新会产生Ω(1)的尾部。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了动态遗憾分析、分布鲁棒目标和KL正则化控制，提供了一种应力自适应更新方法，可扩展到二阶更新、老虎机反馈、异常值处理等多种场景。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making under distribution drift. We propose
entropy-regularized trust-decay, which injects stress-aware exponential tilting
into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

*Tiansheng Hu,Tongyan Hu,Liuyang Bai,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FinTrust是一个专门评估金融领域LLM可信度的基准测试，涵盖多种对齐问题，评估了11个LLM模型，发现专有模型在安全性方面表现更好，开源模型在某些公平性方面有优势，但所有模型在法律意识方面都存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于金融领域的高风险和高利害关系特性，在真实金融应用中部署LLM仍然具有挑战性，需要专门的可信度评估基准。

Method: 开发了FinTrust基准测试，基于实际场景设计广泛的对齐问题，并为每个可信度维度提供细粒度任务。

Result: 评估11个LLM发现：专有模型（如o4-mini）在大多数任务（如安全性）中表现更好；开源模型（如DeepSeek-V3）在特定领域（如行业级公平性）有优势；所有模型在信托对齐和披露等挑战性任务中都表现不佳，显示出法律意识方面的显著差距。

Conclusion: FinTrust可以作为金融领域LLM可信度评估的有价值基准，当前LLM在法律意识方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related
problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains
challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

### [33] [Adaptive Individual Uncertainty under Out-Of-Distribution Shift with Expert-Routed Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15233)
*Amitesh Badkul,Lei Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TESSERA方法，为蛋白质-配体亲和力预测提供可靠的个体不确定性量化，在分布偏移下仍能保持接近名义覆盖率和最佳覆盖-宽度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习社区缺乏可靠、信息丰富且个体化的不确定性量化方法，阻碍了AI/ML在风险敏感领域的应用。特别是在药物发现中，蛋白质-配体亲和力预测面临测定噪声异质性、化学空间不平衡和分布偏移等挑战。

Method: TESSERA结合专家混合模型的多样性和保形校准，提供具有可靠覆盖保证的个体不确定性、信息丰富且自适应的预测区间宽度。

Result: 在独立同分布和基于支架的分布外分割下，TESSERA达到接近名义覆盖率，在覆盖-宽度准则上表现最佳，同时保持竞争力的适应性。

Conclusion: TESSERA通过统一专家混合多样性和保形校准，提供了可信赖、紧凑且自适应的不确定性，适用于药物发现管道中的选择性预测和下游决策。

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了双权重强化学习（DWRL）框架，将思维链推理与Bradley-Terry模型结合，用于处理非可验证任务的人类偏好建模


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在可验证任务上扩展思维链推理已证明有效，但在非可验证的偏好对任务上仍具挑战且研究不足

Method: DWRL通过双权重RL目标整合思维链推理与BT模型：实例级错位权重强调与人类偏好不一致的训练对，组级条件偏好分数促进有前景的思考

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型规模上，DWRL始终优于GPM基线和标量模型，同时产生连贯、可解释的思考

Conclusion: DWRL作为推理增强偏好学习的通用框架，可扩展到可验证任务之外

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

### [35] [Spatiotemporal Transformers for Predicting Avian Disease Risk from Migration Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15254)
*Dingya Feng,Dingyuan Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的框架，利用候鸟迁徙轨迹预测终点疾病风险，整合GPS追踪、疫情记录和地理空间数据，在测试集上取得高精度预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测禽类疾病爆发对野生动物保护和公共卫生至关重要，需要开发能够利用候鸟迁徙模式进行疾病风险预警的系统。

Method: 整合多源数据集（Movebank GPS追踪、WOAH疫情记录、GADM和Natural Earth地理数据），使用H3层次地理空间编码处理坐标，基于Transformer架构学习时空依赖关系来估计终点疾病风险。

Result: 在测试集上表现优异：准确率0.9821，AUC 0.9803，平均精度0.9299，F1分数0.8836（最优阈值下）。

Conclusion: Transformer架构在禽类疾病监测预警系统中具有巨大潜力，能够支持及时干预和预防策略的实施。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian disease outbreaks is critical for wildlife
conservation and public health. This study presents a Transformer-based
framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of
migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS
tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision
(AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These
results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support
early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely
intervention and prevention strategies.

### [36] [DRO-InstructZero: Distributionally Robust Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15260)
*Yangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRO-InstructZero通过将零样本提示优化构建为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，解决了传统提示搜索方法在分布偏移和对抗评估下的性能下降问题。该方法使用f-散度球定义评估分布的模糊集，并通过鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用，在保持贝叶斯搜索查询效率的同时提升分布偏移下的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动提示搜索方法（如InstructZero）在单一评估分布下优化预期性能，导致在分布偏移和对抗评估下性能下降，提示难以在不同设置间迁移。

Method: 将零样本提示优化构建为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，使用f-散度球定义评估分布的模糊集，通过鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用，保持贝叶斯搜索的查询效率。

Result: 在BIG-Bench信息到正式改写任务中，准确率从61.3%提升至85-90%，绝对增益约25-30个百分点；自动调试在领域偏移下获得约25个百分点的增益；稳定任务如因果推理保持96%以上准确率，表明在分布内案例无损失。

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习相结合，提供了一个即插即用且通用的方法，在现实世界不确定性下实现可靠、可迁移的提示对齐。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

### [37] [Robust Layerwise Scaling Rules by Proper Weight Decay Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15262)
*Zhiyuan Fan,Yifeng Liu,Qingyue Zhao,Angela Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了AdamW优化器的权重衰减缩放规则，解决了μP在稳态训练中学习率宽度依赖性问题，实现了跨宽度的零shot超参数迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代尺度不变架构中，训练快速进入优化器主导的稳态，归一化层导致反向尺度敏感性，使有效学习率变得宽度依赖，从而降低了μP的学习率迁移效果。

Method: 引入AdamW的权重衰减缩放规则，通过观察矩阵参数奇异值谱的缩放规律，推导出权重衰减λ₂ ∝ √d的缩放规则，与μP学习率规则η₂ ∝ d⁻¹结合，保持子层增益宽度不变。

Result: 在LLaMA风格Transformer和最小合成设置中验证了该规则，实现了从代理宽度到目标宽度的学习率和权重衰减的零shot迁移，消除了每个宽度的超参数搜索需求。

Conclusion: 该研究通过显式控制优化器设置的稳态尺度，将μP扩展到近初始化阶段之外，为AdamW下的宽度鲁棒超参数迁移提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

TL;DR: RIC-TSC框架将因果发现嵌入时间序列分类，在格陵兰冰上湖演化预测中，因果模型比基于相关性的基线方法在分布外评估中准确率提升12.59%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时空地球观测模型依赖纯相关性特征，在异构域间迁移性差。因果建模能发现稳定、不变的关系，提高分布偏移下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出RIC-TSC框架，使用J-PCMCI+进行区域特定和不变的因果发现，将已验证的预测因子及其时间滞后输入轻量级分类器。

Result: 在1000个手动标注湖泊的平衡基准测试中，因果模型在分布外评估中比相关性基线准确率最高提升12.59%。

Conclusion: 因果发现不仅是特征选择手段，更是构建可泛化、机制基础的地球表面动态过程模型的途径。

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的伪标签框架，用于半监督回归任务，通过双层优化动态调整伪标签影响，解决连续输出中异方差噪声带来的可靠性评估挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督回归中的伪标签应用相对较少探索，与分类不同，回归涉及连续输出和异方差噪声，难以评估伪标签可靠性，导致错误累积和过拟合问题。

Method: 采用不确定性感知的伪标签框架，从双层优化角度动态调整伪标签影响，联合最小化所有数据的经验风险和优化不确定性估计以增强标记数据的泛化能力。

Result: 在多个基准半监督回归数据集上的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，相比现有方法展现出更优越的鲁棒性和性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了不可靠伪标签的影响，为半监督回归提供了实用的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR
datasets, and the results demonstrate superior robustness and performance
compared to existing methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/sxq/Heteroscedastic-Pseudo-Labels.

Method: 提出三阶段框架来描述基础模型在科学中的演化：1）元科学整合；2）人机协同创造；3）自主科学发现。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合集合卡尔曼滤波和全连接神经网络的机器学习数据同化方法，使用小规模集合生成初步分析状态，然后用神经网络预测校正项以提高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集合数据同化方法在分析精度和计算效率之间存在权衡，大集合规模提高精度但计算成本高，需要找到平衡方案。

Method: 使用较小集合规模的EnKF生成初步分析状态，然后通过全连接神经网络学习并预测校正项来补偿有限集合规模带来的性能下降。

Result: 在Lorenz系统和非线性海洋波场模拟实验中，新方法比传统EnKF在相同集合规模下获得更高精度，且额外计算成本可忽略。

Conclusion: EnKF-FCNN方法通过机器学习增强传统数据同化，在保持计算效率的同时显著提高分析精度，具有良好的适应性和应用前景。

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

TL;DR: DFCA是一种完全去中心化的聚类联邦学习算法，无需中央服务器协调，通过顺序运行平均聚合邻居模型，在稀疏连接下仍能保持良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有聚类联邦学习方法依赖中央服务器协调模型更新，存在瓶颈和单点故障问题，限制了在现实去中心化学习场景中的应用。

Method: 使用顺序运行平均来聚合邻居模型作为更新，提供通信高效的替代方案，同时保持聚类性能。

Result: 在各种数据集上的实验表明，DFCA优于其他去中心化算法，性能与集中式IFCA相当，即使在稀疏连接下也表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DFCA展示了在动态现实世界去中心化网络中的鲁棒性和实用性，为处理客户端异构数据提供了一种有效的去中心化解决方案。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了可学习激活函数的随机特征模型(RFLAF)的泛化性质，通过数据依赖的采样方案显著提高了特征数量的理论界限，并在回归和分类任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RFLAF模型的泛化特性，旨在通过数据依赖的采样方案减少所需的特征数量，提高模型效率。

Method: 采用数据依赖的杠杆加权采样方案生成特征，提出近似核学习算法，并与普通采样方案进行对比。

Result: 通过加权采样，MSE损失的s界限从Ω(1/ε²)改进为Ω̃((1/ε)^{1/t})，当Gram矩阵有限秩时甚至达到Ω(1)；Lipschitz损失的界限从Ω(1/ε²)改进为Ω̃((1/ε²)^{1/t})。实验表明加权RFLAF用更少特征达到相同性能。

Conclusion: 数据依赖的杠杆加权采样能显著减少RFLAF模型所需的特征数量，提高学习效率，理论分析和实验结果验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法通常只针对单一类型的攻击，缺乏能够同时防御多种威胁的统一方法。

Method: 使用MI-based逻辑多样性损失鼓励专家关注不同的邻域结构，并设计鲁棒性感知路由器来识别扰动模式并自适应地将受扰动节点路由到相应的鲁棒专家。

Result: 在各种对抗设置下的广泛实验表明，该方法在对抗多种图对抗攻击时始终表现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于MoE架构的统一防御框架能够有效提升图神经网络对抗多种对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple
graph adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: BREEZE通过同时增强学习稳定性、策略提取能力和表示学习质量，有效解决了零样本强化学习中的关键挑战，为开发更强大的通用策略提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best
or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to
prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the
continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We
demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are
available at https://wnjxyk.github.io/RPC.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

Conclusion: SWFP框架通过基于最优传输的变分JKO原理，提供了一种稳定、高效且可证明稳定的流策略微调方法。

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

Motivation: 当存在多个正确答案时，传统基于最大似然估计的监督微调方法假设演示策略属于低复杂度策略类，但本文认为奖励模型属于低基数类别是更弱的假设，需要探索超越似然最大化的学习方法。

Method: 将问题形式化为上下文多臂老虎机中的离线模仿学习，提出一种不依赖似然最大化的新方法，该方法在奖励模型类别基数较低时具有对数级样本复杂度。

Result: 证明了最大似然估计方法在奖励模型低基数情况下可能失败，而新方法能够以对数样本复杂度成功学习。

Conclusion: 当从正确演示中学习时，特别是在奖励模型复杂度较低的情况下，应该超越传统的似然最大化方法，采用更合适的学习策略。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial
for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While
significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental
challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2)
inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in
mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical

Conclusion: OffSim框架能够直接从专家轨迹中有效学习环境动态和奖励函数，实现离线策略训练，为强化学习提供了一种更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

Method: SESA顺序采样框架，首先生成多样化的解题草图，然后将其扩展为完整的推理路径，通过条件化每个新输出于先前输出来确保更广泛的探索

Result: 在合成任务中，顺序采样在路径多样性和从崩溃中恢复方面优于传统RL方法；在三个智能体基准测试中，成功率分别提升+0.25、+0.42和+0.07（相比基线RL最高达211%相对提升）

Conclusion: SESA为探索提供了结构化方法，为RL训练的LLM实现更有效和多样化的推理铺平了道路

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

### [56] [ParaFormer: Shallow Parallel Transformers with Progressive Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15425)
*Wei Wang,Xiao-Yong Wei,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ParaFormer是一种浅层Transformer架构，通过并行分支结构实现真正的结构和计算并行，克服了深度模型的训练时间长、推理延迟高等问题，在性能和效率上均优于标准Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度Transformer模型带来的训练时间长、推理延迟高、资源受限设备上不实用等问题，挑战'越深越好'的传统观念。

Method: 将标准Transformer建模为闭式函数逼近器，通过理论分析表明性能依赖于层间协作而非深度本身。ParaFormer通过并行分支结构组织层，算法化地强制层间协作，实现渐进逼近。

Result: ParaFormer在性能上优于标准Transformer如ViT，支持高达15.07倍的模型压缩，在多GPU部署中比FairScale等并行解决方案快3.30倍。

Conclusion: 基于通用逼近定理的闭式Transformer公式不仅解释了'深度信念'，还为设计高效Transformer架构开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

TL;DR: 本文证明Transformer语言模型是单射的，即不同输入会映射到不同的连续表示，并提出了SipIt算法能够从隐藏激活中精确重构输入文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即Transformer组件（如非线性激活和归一化）的非单射性会阻止从模型表示中精确恢复输入。

Method: 首先数学证明Transformer语言模型在初始化和训练过程中保持单射性；其次通过数十亿次碰撞测试在六个先进语言模型上验证；最后提出SipIt算法实现从隐藏激活到输入文本的精确重构。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证均表明Transformer语言模型是单射的，未观察到任何碰撞；SipIt算法能够在线性时间内精确重构输入文本。

Conclusion: 单射性是语言模型的基本且可利用属性，对透明度、可解释性和安全部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE
motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple
diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped
objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing
generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

Conclusion: 数据集大小可能是理解蒸馏机制的一个基本但被忽视的变量，对蒸馏理论有重要启示。

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

TL;DR: 提出CQD-SHAP框架，使用Shapley值计算复杂查询中各个部分的贡献度，提高神经符号复杂查询回答的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经和神经符号复杂查询回答方法多为黑盒模型，缺乏用户信任。虽然神经符号方法如CQD允许跟踪中间结果，但无法解释查询中不同部分的重要性。

Method: 基于合作博弈论中的Shapley值，计算每个查询部分对特定答案排名的贡献度，满足所有基本Shapley公理。

Result: 在必要性和充分性解释的自动化评估中，与多种基线方法比较，显示该方法对大多数查询类型都有效。

Conclusion: CQD-SHAP能够解释神经预测器从不完整知识图谱中推断新知识的价值，相比仅依赖知识图谱中现有事实的符号方法更具优势。

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

Motivation: 潜变量能量模型能够为观测数据和潜变量的联合对分配归一化能量，提供表达能力强的生成建模同时捕捉隐藏结构，但传统训练方法存在局限性。

Method: 将最大似然训练重新表述为鞍点问题，通过交替进行过阻尼Langevin更新和随机参数上升来训练模型，无需判别器或辅助网络。

Result: 在标准平滑性和耗散性假设下证明了存在性和收敛性，在KL散度和Wasserstein-2距离上具有衰减率，且在物理系统数值近似上表现优于可比方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的潜变量能量模型训练框架，鞍点视角产生了比受限摊销后验更紧的ELBO，在生成建模任务中具有竞争力。

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

Motivation: 解决传统Best-of-N采样方法在N增加时收益递减的效率问题，希望在不重新训练大语言模型的情况下提高推理性能

Method: 两阶段方法：先探索解空间，然后通过学习输入特定的温度T和加性偏移向量δ来校准logits，引导生成更可靠的推理路径

Result: 在MATH-500和AIME-2024数据集上，CarBoN在达到相同准确率时采样次数减少4倍，在固定预算下通常获得更高准确率

Conclusion: CarBoN框架有效提高了测试时推理效率，T和δ在平衡输出多样性和正确性方面发挥互补作用，该框架可推广到束搜索等步级采样策略

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and
correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level
sampling strategies such as beam search. For more information, please refer to

Motivation: 传统使用有限元方法分析IPMSM转子形状计算成本高，需要寻找更高效的替代方法。

Method: 开发自定义深度学习模型KS-Net，并与Cubic SVM、Quadratic SVM、Fine KNN、Cosine KNN和Fine Tree算法进行对比，使用9,000个样本的平衡数据集和10折交叉验证。

Result: Cubic SVM和Quadratic SVM算法完美分类所有样本，准确率100%；KS-Net模型准确率99.98%，仅有两个误分类。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可以高精度预测IPMSM转子形状，为电机设计过程加速、自动化转子识别系统和数据驱动故障诊断提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络定理证明生成的证明过长，难以被人类理解，限制了数学洞察力。现有方法难以处理RL训练证明器生成的极长证明，且缺乏训练数据。

Method: 通过专家迭代和强化学习训练ProofOptimizer模型，使用Lean验证简化并提供训练信号，在推理时采用迭代证明缩短工作流程。

Result: 在标准基准测试中显著压缩证明长度：miniF2F减少87%，PutnamBench减少57%，Seed-Prover的IMO 2025证明减少49%。简化后的证明在Lean中验证更快，且作为训练数据能进一步提升下游证明器性能。

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer是首个能够有效简化Lean证明的语言模型，解决了证明简化的关键瓶颈，为数学定理证明提供了更实用的工具。

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

Motivation: 解决反事实预测中的分配偏差问题，避免传统对抗性训练的不稳定性和调参负担。

Method: 学习一个随机表示Z，在预测结果的同时最小化I(Z;T)，推导出可处理的变分目标上界信息项，并与监督解码器耦合。

Result: 在数值模拟和真实临床数据集上，在似然性、反事实误差和政策评估等指标上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在避免对抗性训练不稳定性的同时，在反事实预测任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

Motivation: 解决强化学习系统的安全性问题，确保RL系统在最优性能的同时提供形式化的安全保证。

Result: 在确定性环境中保持最优性，提供仅依赖于备份评论家准确度的成本期望上界，实验表明在训练时也能保证安全性。

Conclusion: ProSh能够在模型无关设置下提供形式化的安全保证，同时保持性能最优性。

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

Conclusion: 基于自动机的偏好方法在处理非马尔可夫奖励方面具有优势，为传统奖励建模提供了可扩展、高效且无需人工干预的替代方案，并提供了收敛性保证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

Motivation: 现有CLIP及其变体未能充分利用点互信息(PMI)的线性结构，而理论研究表明跨模态相似度度量应对应PMI。

Method: 在再生核希尔伯特空间中使用内积来近似PMI，理论上可以任意精度逼近PMI。

Result: 在多个检索和分类任务中，KME-CLIP整体表现优于标准CLIP。

Conclusion: 通过利用PMI的线性结构，KME-CLIP能够更有效地计算跨模态相似度，提升多模态对比预训练性能。

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

TL;DR: Chronos-2是一个预训练的时间序列模型，能够在零样本情况下处理单变量、多变量和协变量预测任务，通过组注意力机制实现跨序列的上下文学习，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练时间序列模型主要关注单变量预测，限制了在现实世界多变量数据和协变量场景中的应用，因此需要开发能够处理更复杂预测任务的通用模型。

Method: 采用组注意力机制促进跨多个时间序列的上下文学习，通过在合成数据集上进行训练，为单变量序列施加多样化的多变量结构，从而获得通用能力。

Result: 在fev-bench、GIFT-Eval和Chronos Benchmark II三个综合基准测试中达到最先进性能，特别是在多变量和协变量预测任务上显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Chronos-2的上下文学习能力使其成为通用的预测模型，可以直接用于现实世界预测流程中，无需特定任务训练。

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

TL;DR: 论文提出SNOO优化器，通过将Nesterov动量应用于伪梯度，在非分布式设置下实现1.5-2.5倍的计算效率提升，且改进效果随模型规模增大而增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiLoCo优化器在非分布式设置中表现出色，但其有效性来源尚不明确。本研究旨在揭示DiLoCo性能提升的关键因素，并开发更高效的优化方法。

Method: 提出Step-K Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO)，在Lookahead双循环框架基础上，将Nesterov动量应用于伪梯度更新过程。该方法与AdamW、Muon等多种内部优化器兼容。

Result: SNOO在非分布式设置下达到1.5-2.5倍的计算效率提升，训练规模可达1e23 FLOPs，且模型规模越大改进效果越明显。同时具有最小的计算和内存开销。

Conclusion: SNOO通过将Nesterov动量应用于伪梯度，显著提升了训练效率，是一种实用的优化器增强方法，适用于各种内部优化器。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand
for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family
of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

we demonstrate superior performance in terms of reconstructed data quality,

*Saumya B*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MC Dropout不确定性在脑肿瘤MRI分割中对边界错误的定位能力有限，与分割误差的全局相关性弱，边界相关性可忽略，需要开发替代或混合的不确定性估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然MC Dropout被广泛用于估计模型不确定性，但其在识别分割错误（特别是肿瘤边界附近）方面的有效性仍不清楚，需要实证研究其在医学图像分割中的实际价值。

Method: 使用U-Net在四种数据增强设置（无增强、水平翻转、旋转、缩放）下进行2D脑肿瘤MRI分割，通过50次随机前向传播计算不确定性，并使用Pearson和Spearman系数将不确定性与像素级误差进行相关性分析。

Result: 结果显示全局相关性较弱（r≈0.30-0.38），边界相关性可忽略（|r|<0.05）。虽然不同增强设置间的差异具有统计显著性（p<0.001），但缺乏实际意义。

Conclusion: MC Dropout不确定性在定位边界错误方面提供的线索有限，强调了在医学图像分割中需要替代或混合不确定性估计方法的必要性。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: We introduce the Strategic Doubly Robust (SDR) estimator, a novel framework
that integrates strategic equilibrium modeling with doubly robust estimation
for causal inference in strategic environments. SDR addresses endogenous
treatment assignment arising from strategic agent behavior, maintaining double
robustness while incorporating strategic considerations. Theoretical analysis
confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic
unconfoundedness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SDR's superior performance
over baseline methods, achieving 7.6\%-29.3\% bias reduction across varying

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了神经特征假设(NFA)的理论分析，证明了在平衡权重初始化下，NFA在L层线性网络中成立且指数α=1/L，显示了深度依赖性。对于不平衡初始化，使用权重衰减时NFA渐近成立。同时提供了非线性激活网络的反例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解特征学习是建立深度神经网络数学基础的重要开放问题。神经特征假设(NFA)描述了训练后第一层权重Gram矩阵与输入梯度外积平均值(AGOP)的关系，需要理论验证其在不同网络架构中的有效性。

Method: 采用梯度流动力学分析，在平衡权重初始化下证明NFA对L层线性网络成立；分析不平衡初始化下权重衰减的影响；构造非线性激活网络的反例；通过数值实验验证理论结果。

Result: 证明了在平衡初始化下，L层线性网络的NFA指数α=1/L；对于不平衡初始化，使用权重衰减时NFA渐近成立；发现了非线性激活网络的反例；数值实验验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: NFA在深度线性网络中具有深度依赖性，指数α=1/L；权重衰减有助于不平衡初始化下的NFA成立；非线性激活可能破坏NFA，即使网络能很好拟合训练数据。

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

Motivation: 受迭代联合图传播(IJGP)算法启发，旨在通过神经网络方法改进#SAT问题的求解准确性。

Method: 使用树分解将CNF公式编码为联合图，在图上进行迭代消息传递，并通过学习划分函数来近似模型数量。应用注意力机制在联合图的簇内和簇间，使模型更关注概率推理中的关键变量和簇。

Result: 实验表明Attn-JGNN模型比其他神经网络方法取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 注意力增强的联合图神经网络能够有效提高#SAT问题的求解精度，通过注意力机制减少冗余计算并关注关键信息。

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model
for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy.
Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRATING是一个无需训练的推理系统，通过渐进式聚类剪枝和内存优化技术，显著降低交叉编码器重排序器的延迟和内存使用，在保持精度的同时提升边缘设备上AI服务的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义top-K选择在边缘AI服务中至关重要，但其延迟和内存需求在边缘硬件上占据主导地位。研究发现只有相对排名重要，而非精确分数，且中间层存在序列级稀疏性，为剪枝提供了机会。

Method: 提出整体前向传播方法，通过维护全局候选视图进行渐进式聚类剪枝，采用双层滑动窗口和分块执行策略重叠I/O与计算，从而限制峰值内存使用。

Result: 在0.6B到8B参数的重排序器上评估，GRATING在微基准测试中延迟降低达89.0%，峰值内存减少达94.9%，且精度无损失。在三个真实世界应用中，延迟降低11.6%-51.0%，峰值内存减少18.6%-77.8%。

Conclusion: GRATING显著提升了边缘设备上AI服务的效率和可部署性，证明了通过利用序列级稀疏性和优化内存管理可以实现高效的top-K选择。

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

Method: 使用指令级位运算进行紧凑模型表示和加速处理；引入提前退出机制避免不必要计算；提出字面重排序策略最大化提前退出概率；在训练后推理前阶段通过统计分析和Tsetlin自动机动作进行重排序

Result: 在ARM处理器上的实验显示，相比传统基于整数的TM实现，推理时间减少高达96.71%，同时保持相当的代码密度

Conclusion: 所提出的优化实现显著提升了Tsetlin机器的推理效率，使其更适用于资源受限设备

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

Result: 在CIFAR-10上比DLGNs收敛更快，同时保持可比精度，为扩展到高输入逻辑块提供了潜力。

Conclusion: WARP-LUTs为现代FPGA的高效部署和实时科学应用提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

Result: 在金融、IT网络和网络物理系统等多个领域，CAP实现了更高的攻击成功率，同时显著减少了运行时间

Conclusion: CAP方法有效解决了约束特征空间中的对抗攻击问题，并能从数据中学习特征约束，在结构化输入空间中具有广泛适用性

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

Motivation: 有限元分析计算成本高昂，不适合设计优化问题，需要寻找深度学习模型作为替代方案。

Method: 使用图神经网络和3D U-Net作为FEA替代模型，引入基于Navier-Cauchy方程的物理信息神经网络框架，采用课程学习策略（数据预训练+物理信息微调）。

Result: GNN明显优于U-Net，最差GCN框架误差8.7%，最佳U-Net误差13.0%。MPNN和Graph Transformer误差分别为3.5%和2.6%。PINN将误差降低达11.3%。

Conclusion: MPNN PINN提供了最佳实用解决方案，在预测性能、模型大小和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要关注减轻遗忘和提高准确率，但忽视了网络校准的重要性。神经崩溃现象在持续学习中具有优势，但很少有工作关注改善模型校准以实现更可靠的预测。

Method: 提出Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)，一种针对基于神经崩溃方法的自适应混合策略。该方法根据神经崩溃下特征空间的几何特性调整混合过程，确保更稳健的正则化和对齐。

Result: 实验表明SAMix显著提升性能，在持续学习中超越最先进方法，同时改善模型校准。提高了跨任务准确率和预测的可靠性。

Conclusion: SAMix是持续学习系统稳健性的有前景的进展，同时增强了准确率和预测的可靠性。

Abstract: While most continual learning methods focus on mitigating forgetting and
improving accuracy, they often overlook the critical aspect of network
calibration, despite its importance. Neural collapse, a phenomenon where
last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust
regularization and alignment. Experiments show that SAMix significantly boosts
performance, surpassing SOTA methods in continual learning while also improving
model calibration. SAMix enhances both across-task accuracy and the broader
reliability of predictions, making it a promising advancement for robust

ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and
profitability.

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决跨物种迁移学习问题，利用生物学上的同源关系来指导知识迁移，提高转录组数据的有效利用。

Method: 在预训练的前馈神经网络前添加一个学习的物种转换层，该层的权重通过同源关系的二分图邻接矩阵进行掩码，实现源物种到目标物种基因表达的线性映射。

Result: 该方法提供了生物学基础和可解释的跨物种迁移学习方法，转换层的学习权重可用于解释功能同源性。

Conclusion: TRON为更有效地利用转录组数据铺平了道路，目前正在收集跨物种转录组/表型数据进行实验验证。

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.

Motivation: Koopman算子在控制领域的应用进展迅速，但理论基础仍不完善，需要研究不同扩展框架之间的理论联系。

Method: 分析两种Koopman控制框架：基于无限输入序列的Koopman算子和Koopman控制族，研究它们在特定函数空间条件下的等价性。

Result: 在特定函数空间条件下，两种框架在算子作用和系统轨迹函数值方面是等价的，并提供了框架间转换的构造性工具。

Conclusion: 建立了两种Koopman控制框架的等价性，为Koopman方法在控制领域提供了统一的理论基础。

Abstract: The Koopman operator, originally defined for dynamical systems without input,
has inspired many applications in control. Yet, the theoretical foundations
underpinning this progress in control remain underdeveloped. This paper
investigates the theoretical structure and connections between two extensions
of Koopman theory to control: (i) Koopman operator via infinite input sequences
and (ii) the Koopman control family. Although these frameworks encode system
information in fundamentally different ways, we show that under certain
conditions on the function spaces they operate on, they are equivalent. The
equivalence is both in terms of the actions of the Koopman-based formulations
in each framework as well as the function values on the system trajectories.
Our analysis provides constructive tools to translate between the frameworks,
offering a unified perspective for Koopman methods in control.

Conclusion: 提出的控制器设计方法能够有效处理系统参数未知和存在扰动的情况，保证三角形耦合三回路热虹吸系统的稳定性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stability of a triangularly coupled triple
loop thermosyphon system with momentum and heat exchange at the coupling point
as well as the existence of disturbances. The controller consists of a single,
local state feedback. From the stability analysis, we obtain explicit bounds on
the feedback gains, which depend on the Rayleigh numbers and the momentum
coupling parameter, but independent of the thermal coupling parameter. The
existence of the stability bounds allows us to design decentralized adaptive
controllers to automatically search for the feasible gains when the system
parameters are unknown. In the case of existing disturbances in the system, we
approximate the disturbances via an extended state observer for the purpose of
disturbance rejection. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the
performance of the proposed decentralized disturbance rejection controller
design.

Conclusion: 问题驱动的场景缩减框架能有效保留尾部风险并提高问题特定代表性，为随机优化提供高效计算解决方案。

Abstract: Scenario reduction (SR) alleviates the computational complexity of
scenario-based stochastic optimization with conditional value-at-risk
(SBSO-CVaR) by identifying representative scenarios to depict the underlying
uncertainty and tail risks. Existing distribution-driven SR methods emphasize
statistical similarity but often exclude extreme scenarios, leading to weak
tail-risk awareness and insufficient problem-specific representativeness.
Instead, this paper proposes an iterative problem-driven scenario reduction
framework. Specifically, we integrate the SBSO-CVaR problem structure into SR
process and project the original scenario set from the distribution space onto
the problem space. Subsequently, to minimize the SR optimality gap with
acceptable computation complexity, we propose a tractable iterative
problem-driven scenario reduction (IPDSR) method that selects representative
scenarios that best approximate the optimality distribution of the original
scenario set while preserving tail risks. Furthermore, the iteration process is
rendered as a mixed-integer program to enable scenario partitioning and
representative scenarios selection. And ex-post problem-driven evaluation
indices are proposed to evaluate the SR performance. Numerical experiments show
IPDSR significantly outperforms existing SR methods by achieving an optimality
gap of less than 1% within an acceptable computation time.

Abstract: We consider the minimisation problem of submodular functions and investigate
the application of a zeroth-order method to this problem. The method is based
on exploiting a Gaussian smoothing random oracle to estimate the smoothed

length. The complexity analysis and hyperparameter selection are presented for
all the cases. The theoretical results are illustrated via numerical examples.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization (BLO) offers a principled framework for hierarchical
decision-making and has been widely applied in machine learning tasks such as
hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. While existing BLO methods are
mostly developed in Euclidean spaces, many real-world problems involve
structural constraints. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian bilevel
optimization (RBLO) algorithm that incorporates a bilevel descent aggregation
(BDA) scheme to jointly coordinate upper- and lower-level updates. Concretely,
first we abstract the constraints in the BLO to a manifold structure and then
transform the constrained BLO be a unconstrained RBLO problem. Second, to
address limitations of existing RBLO methods, particularly the restrictive
assumptions required for convergence, we reformulate the bilevel problem using
smooth manifold mappings and provide a convergence analysis under the
conditions of geodesic convexity and Lipschitz smoothness. Finally, we recall
the multi-view hypergraph spectral clustering task, and evaluate the proposed
approach on 3sources data sets. The numerical results validate the superior
performance over Euclidean and manifold-based baselines.

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a standard approach for sample-efficient global
optimisation of expensive black-box functions, yet its scalability to high
dimensions remains challenging. Here, we investigate nonlinear dimensionality
reduction techniques that reduce the problem to a sequence of low-dimensional
Latent-Space BO (LSBO). While early LSBO methods used (linear) random
projections (Wang et al., 2013), building on Grosnit et al. (2021), we employ
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for LSBO, focusing on deep metric loss for
structured latent manifolds and VAE retraining to adapt the encoder-decoder to
newly sampled regions. We propose some changes in their implementation,
originally designed for tasks such as molecule generation, and reformulate the
algorithm for broader optimisation purposes. We then couple LSBO with
Sequential Domain Reduction (SDR) directly in the latent space (SDR-LSBO),
yielding an algorithm that narrows the latent search domains as evidence
accumulates. Implemented in a GPU-accelerated BoTorch stack with Matern-5/2
Gaussian process surrogates, our numerical results show improved optimisation
quality across benchmark tasks and that structured latent manifolds improve BO
performance. Additionally, we compare random embeddings and VAEs as two
mechanisms for dimensionality reduction, showing that the latter outperforms
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to combine
SDR with VAE-based LSBO, and our analysis clarifies design choices for metric
shaping and retraining that are critical for scalable latent space BO. For
reproducibility, our source code is available at

Abstract: Traditional end-to-end contextual robust optimization models are trained for
specific contextual data, requiring complete retraining whenever new contextual
information arrives. This limitation hampers their use in online
decision-making problems such as energy scheduling, where multiperiod
optimization must be solved every few minutes. In this paper, we propose a
novel Data-Driven Contextual Uncertainty Set, which gives rise to a new
End-to-End Data-Driven Contextual Robust Optimization model. For
right-hand-side uncertainty, we introduce a reformulation scheme that enables
the development of a variant of the Column-and-Constraint Generation (CCG)
algorithm. This new CCG method explicitly considers the contextual vector
within the cut expressions, allowing previously generated cuts to remain valid
for new contexts, thereby significantly accelerating convergence in online
applications. Numerical experiments on energy and reserve scheduling problems,
based on classical test cases and large-scale networks (with more than 10,000
nodes), demonstrate that the proposed method reduces computation times and
operational costs while capturing context-dependent risk structures. The
proposed framework (model and method), therefore, offers a unified, scalable,
and prescriptive approach to robust decision-making under uncertainty,
effectively bridging data-driven learning and optimization.

*El Mahdi Chayti,Martin Jaggi*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种异步计算梯度和曲率的分离客户端框架，在保持二阶方法收敛性的同时显著减少计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二阶方法虽然收敛快，但由于Hessian矩阵计算和分解成本过高，在实践中很少使用。需要一种能平衡计算效率和收敛性能的方法。

Method: 采用分离客户端框架，让梯度和曲率计算在不同的客户端异步进行，避免了手动调参的Lazy Hessian方法，专注于立方正则化。

Result: 理论证明该方法能保持强收敛性，并在时钟时间上实现√τ倍的加速，其中τ是Hessian计算与梯度计算的时间比。实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 异步曲率计算方法在保持二阶精度的同时，显著优于传统方法和Lazy Hessian基线，在高维问题中具有重要的实际意义。

Abstract: Second-order methods promise faster convergence but are rarely used in
practice because Hessian computations and decompositions are far more expensive
than gradients. We propose a \emph{split-client} framework where gradients and
curvature are computed asynchronously by separate clients. This abstraction
captures realistic delays and inexact Hessian updates while avoiding the manual
tuning required by Lazy Hessian methods. Focusing on cubic regularization, we
show that our approach retains strong convergence guarantees and achieves a
provable wall-clock speedup of order $\sqrt{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the
relative time needed to compute and decompose the Hessian compared to a
gradient step. Since $\tau$ can be orders of magnitude larger than one in
high-dimensional problems, this improvement is practically significant.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm the theory: asynchronous
curvature consistently outperforms vanilla and Lazy Hessian baselines, while
maintaining second-order accuracy.

Abstract: Algorithms for continuous optimization problems have a rich history of design
and innovation over the past several decades, in which mathematical analysis of
their convergence and complexity properties plays a central role. Besides their
theoretical properties, optimization algorithms are interesting also for their
practical usefulness as computational tools for solving real-world problems.
There are often gaps between the practical performance of an algorithm and what
can be proved about it. These two facets of the field -- the theoretical and
the practical -- interact in fascinating ways, each driving innovation in the
other. This work focuses on the development of algorithms in two areas --
linear programming and unconstrained minimization of smooth functions --
outlining major algorithm classes in each area along with their theoretical
properties and practical performance, and highlighting how advances in theory
and practice have influenced each other in these areas. In discussing theory,
we focus mainly on non-asymptotic complexity, which are upper bounds on the
amount of computation required by a given algorithm to find an approximate
solution of problems in a given class.

TL;DR: 对AC最优潮流问题的两种主要解法（内点法和空间分支法）及其数据增强变体进行了全面实证比较，发现数据增强策略能提升两种方法的性能，但空间分支法计算成本仍高，而现代内点法求解器表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AC最优潮流问题是非凸NP难优化任务，对电力系统安全经济运行至关重要。需要比较不同求解策略的性能，特别是探索如何利用历史数据提升求解效率。

Method: 采用内点法和空间分支法两种主要策略，并开发了数据增强变体：内点法利用历史数据指导初始化，空间分支法利用数据约束搜索区域。在不同规模网络和标准/修改配置下进行实证比较。

Result: 数据增强策略能改善收敛性和减少计算时间。空间分支法计算需求仍然很高，内点法求解器表现出强大鲁棒性，即使在存在多个局部最优解的挑战性实例中也能收敛到全局最优。

Conclusion: 数据增强方法对两种求解策略都有帮助，但空间分支法需要进一步改进才能实际应用，而现代内点法求解器在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem is a non-convex, NP-hard
optimization task essential for secure and economic power system operation. Two
prominent solution strategies are interior-point methods, valued for
computational efficiency, and spatial branching techniques, which provide
global optimality guarantees at higher computational cost. In this work, we
also explore data-boosted variants that leverage historical operating data to
enhance performance by guiding initialization in interior-point methods or
constraining the search region in spatial branching. We conduct a comprehensive
empirical comparison across networks of varying sizes and under both standard
benchmark conditions and modified configurations designed to induce local
optima. Our results show that data-boosted strategies can improve convergence
and reduce computation times for both approaches. Spatial branching, however,
remains computationally demanding, requiring further development for practical
application. In contrast, modern interior-point solvers exhibit remarkable
robustness, often converging to the global optimum even in challenging
instances with multiple local solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的凸化框架，通过将机会约束集合重构为提升空间中的单纯形上的双线性集合，并采用逐步聚合过程来推导原始变量空间中的面定义不等式，显著增强了机会约束规划的松弛效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机会约束规划中的混合整数重构涉及带有背包约束的非凸混合集合，导致松弛效果弱和计算挑战。现有方法主要依赖特定类型有效不等式的扩展，限制了凸包覆盖和新结构的发现。

Method: 开发了新的基于聚合的凸化技术，将机会约束集合重构为单纯形上的双线性集合，通过逐步聚合过程系统推导原始变量空间中的强不等式。

Result: 初步计算实验表明，新不等式描述了基准实例凸包中超过90%的面定义不等式，显著增强了现有松弛效果。

Conclusion: 该框架统一并推广了现有有效不等式族，同时引入了捕获更大凸包部分的新不等式，推进了对机会约束规划多面体结构的理解。

Abstract: Chance-constrained programming is a widely used framework for decision-making
under uncertainty, yet its mixed-integer reformulations involve nonconvex
mixing sets with a knapsack constraint, leading to weak relaxations and
computational challenges. Most existing approaches for strengthening the
relaxations of these sets rely primarily on extensions of a specific class of
valid inequalities, limiting both convex hull coverage and the discovery of
fundamentally new structures. In this paper, we develop a novel convexification
framework that reformulates chance-constrained sets as bilinear sets over a
simplex in a lifted space and employs a step-by-step aggregation procedure to
derive facet-defining inequalities in the original space of variables. Our
approach generalizes and unifies established families of valid inequalities in
the literature while introducing new ones that capture substantially larger
portions of the convex hull. Main contributions include: (i) the development of
a new aggregation-based convexification technique for bilinear sets over a
simplex in a lower-dimensional space; (ii) the introduction of a novel bilinear
reformulation of mixing sets with a knapsack constraint -- arising from
single-row relaxations of chance constraints -- over a simplex, which enables
the systematic derivation of strong inequalities in the original variable
space; and (iii) the characterization of facet-defining inequalities within a
unified framework that contains both existing and new families. Preliminary
computational experiments demonstrate that our inequalities describe over 90\%
of the facet-defining inequalities of the convex hull of benchmark instances,
significantly strengthening existing relaxations and advancing the polyhedral
understanding of chance-constrained programs.

### [101] [OpenEstimate: Evaluating LLMs on Reasoning Under Uncertainty with Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15096)
*Alana Renda,Jillian Ross,Michael Cafarella,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenEstimate是一个用于评估语言模型在不确定性下进行数值估计和概率推理能力的多领域基准测试，发现前沿语言模型的概率先验通常不准确且过于自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署的语言模型需要处理不完全信息和进行不确定性推理，但现有评估主要关注有明确答案的问题，缺乏对不确定性推理能力的系统评估。

Method: 构建OpenEstimate基准测试，包含需要模型综合背景信息并表达概率先验的数值估计任务，评估这些先验的准确性和校准度。

Result: 六个前沿语言模型的概率先验通常不准确且过于自信，性能仅随不确定性激发方式有轻微改善，但不受采样策略、推理努力或提示设计变化的影响。

Conclusion: OpenEstimate为前沿语言模型提供了具有挑战性的评估平台，并为开发更好的概率估计和不确定性推理模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

Motivation: 利用程序化内容生成(PCG)技术减少游戏开发中的人工工作量，创造动态、可重玩和可扩展的环境，探索AI在创意游戏开发中的潜力。

Method: 使用Unity ML-Agents工具包中的近端策略优化(PPO)算法训练两个智能体：蜂鸟智能体学习导航和收集花朵，浮岛智能体学习基于障碍物位置和蜂鸟性能反馈生成花朵布局。

Result: 该方法产生了有效的智能体行为，并在各种环境配置中展现出强大的泛化能力，为基于机器学习的自主游戏关卡设计开辟了新机会。

Conclusion: 这项工作突显了DRL在使智能体能够在虚拟环境中生成和解决内容的潜力，推动了AI在创意游戏开发过程中的贡献边界。

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

TL;DR: 该论文认为AGI进展受理论限制而非数据或规模限制，提出了因果机制优先的方法论，强调假设空间变化作为首要操作，通过结构原则使错误发现和修正变得可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战柏拉图表示假说，指出仅凭观测充分性无法保证干预能力，因为观测等价的世界在干预下可能产生分歧，需要转向以错误为中心的视角。

Method: 提出因果机制方法，将假设空间变化作为首要操作，引入局部性和自主性原则、独立因果机制和组合自主性原则等结构原则，提供可操作的诊断工具。

Result: 建立了使错误发现和修正可行的理论框架，能够将不可达错误转化为可达错误并进行修正。

Conclusion: AGI发展需要理论突破，因果机制方法为构建能够发现和修正错误的智能系统提供了理论支架。

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

TL;DR: HugAgent是一个用于评估AI模型从群体推理向个体推理适应能力的基准测试，包含合成和人类双轨设计，旨在让机器推理更贴近人类思维的个体性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要模拟群体共识，缺乏对个体推理风格和信念轨迹的捕捉，需要开发能适应个体推理特点的AI系统。

Method: 采用双轨设计：合成轨道用于大规模系统压力测试，人类轨道用于生态有效的"出声思考"推理数据收集，评估模型在预测个体推理和信念更新方面的表现。

Result: 实验显示最先进的LLM在个体推理适应方面存在持续差距，HugAgent成为首个可扩展的基准测试，用于对齐机器推理与人类思维的个体性。

Conclusion: HugAgent为推进机器推理更贴近人类个体思维提供了首个可扩展的评估框架，揭示了当前模型在捕捉个体推理演化方面的局限性。

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as
HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实工作场所环境中情感识别因缺乏大规模、长期自然收集数据集而面临的挑战，特别是在COVID-19疫情期间捕捉员工对重大社会事件的情绪反应。

Method: 使用深度学习面部表情识别技术收集数据，每个记录包含7种情绪概率，并计算32种扩展情感指标如效价、唤醒度、波动性等，采用随机森林和LSTM模型进行基线实验。

Result: 技术验证显示数据质量高，成功复现已知心理模式（周末效应：效价提升192%，p<0.001），员工离职预测AUC=1.0，情感分类准确率达91.2%，效价预测R2=0.84。

Conclusion: 这是目前公开可用的最大、最长的纵向工作场所情感数据集，为情感识别、情感动态建模、情绪传染、离职预测和情感感知系统设计等研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,
emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

*Brett Reynolds*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出AGI评估应基于稳态属性簇理论，采用因果中心性权重和持久性测试，而非对称权重和快照评分，以减少脆弱性和博弈行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估使用对称权重和快照分数，无法区分持久能力和脆弱表现，且忽视了不同领域在智力结构中的重要性差异。

Method: 提出两个评估扩展：基于CHC理论的中心性优先分数和簇稳定性指数系列，分别处理领域权重和性能持久性问题。

Result: 这些扩展保持了多领域广度，同时减少了评估的脆弱性和可博弈性。

Conclusion: AGI评估应关注能力的持久性和领域间的关系稳定性，而非仅靠快照表现，并提供了可实施的黑盒测试协议。

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

Conclusion: 该方法为多维数据分析提供了新思路和工具，构建了动态协作的分析生态系统。

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

TL;DR: KG-Agent是一个基于经验驱动的学习框架，通过构建状态-动作知识图来解决无API环境下GUI操作的效率瓶颈问题，在复杂决策环境中显著提升了探索效率和策略深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件大多缺乏可访问的API，导致智能体只能通过像素级GUI进行操作。在这种无API环境下，基于大语言模型的智能体面临严重效率瓶颈：只能基于局部视觉经验做出短视决策，依赖低效的试错方法，阻碍了技能获取和长期规划。

Method: 提出KG-Agent框架，将原始像素级交互构建为持久的状态-动作知识图(SA-KG)。通过连接功能相似但视觉不同的GUI状态，形成丰富的经验邻域。设计了基于图拓扑的混合内在奖励机制，结合状态价值奖励和探索新颖性奖励，将战略规划与纯探索解耦。

Result: 在Civilization V和Slay the Spire两个复杂的开放式GUI决策环境中进行评估，相比最先进方法，在探索效率和策略深度方面都取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: KG-Agent通过构建经验知识图有效解决了无API环境下智能体操作的效率瓶颈，实现了更高效的探索和更深层次的战略规划。

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 提出的基于图结构的多模态上下文记忆系统AUGUSTUS在效率和性能上都优于现有的方法，验证了多模态记忆在代理系统中的重要性。

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit

multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型的监督微调数据质量不足，存在事实错误和幻觉问题，主要由于视觉感知能力不足。

Method: 使用视觉识别模型和OCR提取结构化视觉先验，结合三个先进LMM评估原始答案，通过统计融合获得高置信度共识分数，训练轻量级批评模型，最后选择最高分答案作为精炼结果。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，使用VERITAS处理数据微调的模型表现优于使用原始数据的模型，特别是在文本丰富和细粒度推理任务中。

Conclusion: VERITAS能有效提升多模态数据质量，其批评模型在保持高效的同时展现出与先进LMM相当的能力。

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B和1.5B模型上，DEPO实现了序列长度减少39%，减少了低效token中的过度推理路径，同时在整体准确率上优于基础模型。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: 本文提出了可修正性目标的概念，通过一种转换方法使任何目标在不牺牲性能的前提下变得可修正，确保AI不会抗拒训练更新或关闭。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在部分学习目标后往往会抗拒进一步的目标更新，因为继续追求现有目标通常更有利。可修正性对于训练收敛、纠正错误和适应人类偏好变化至关重要。

Method: 引入形式化定义，提出一种转换方法，通过条件奖励预测构建可修正版本的目标，并可递归扩展到新创建的代理。

Result: 两个网格世界实验证明，这些可修正目标可以有效学习，并产生期望的行为。

Conclusion: 可修正性是一个关键的安全属性，所提出的方法能够在不损失性能的情况下实现目标的可修正性。

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

TL;DR: MARS是一个端到端的强化学习框架，通过自博弈训练LLM在多智能体系统中进行推理，在合作和竞争游戏中都取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习在单智能体任务中有效，但在多轮次、多智能体场景中的应用仍未被充分探索，主要挑战包括长期信用分配和智能体特定优势估计。

Method: MARS框架包含轮次级优势估计器用于信用分配，以及智能体特定优势归一化来稳定多智能体训练，通过自博弈在合作和竞争游戏中训练。

Result: 在保留游戏中性能提升达28.7%，在推理基准测试中多智能体系统性能持续提升，集成到领先多智能体系统后在AIME上提升10.0%，GPQA-Diamond上提升12.5%。

Conclusion: 通过战略游戏中的自博弈进行端到端RL训练是开发LLM可泛化多智能体推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code
and models are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-nics/MARS.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖单一微调模型或基于规则的固定路由，缺乏灵活性和适应性。需要一种能够动态选择领域专家、同时保持对话能力的解决方案。

Method: 使用LangGraph进行工作流管理，让基础LLM分析查询并作为语义路由器动态选择最相关的LoRA适配器工具，结合多智能体编排和参数高效微调。

Result: 系统能够准确提供专业化响应，同时保持对话能力，支持API和Web接口，完全开源，为领域自适应AI助手提供可扩展基础。

Conclusion: Adaptive Minds通过动态LoRA工具选择和智能路由，实现了灵活高效的领域自适应AI系统，平衡了专业性和通用性。

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as
domain-specific tools. Instead of relying on a single fine-tuned model or rigid
rule-based routing, our approach empowers the base LLM itself to act as a
semantic router analyzing each query and dynamically selecting the most
relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between
different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent
orchestration with the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive
Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational
ability. The system is built with LangGraph for workflow management, supports
both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source, providing a scalable and
extensible foundation for domain-adaptive AI assistance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个检测和解决强化学习中判断不一致性的框架，包括冲突检测率指标和去冲突图奖励方法，显著提升训练稳定性和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在强化学习中面临判断不一致性问题，特别是偏好循环等逻辑一致性问题尚未得到充分解决，这会影响强化学习的稳定性。

Method: 引入冲突检测率来量化判断冲突，并提出去冲突图奖励框架，通过构建偏好图、转换为无冲突有向无环图，生成逻辑一致的奖励信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架相比强基线方法显著提升了训练稳定性和模型性能。

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性是AI反馈中一个关键且现在可管理的维度，该框架为解决判断不一致性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

TL;DR: 提出MM-HCAN多模态超图对比注意力网络，用于电机故障诊断，通过超图拓扑和对比学习融合多模态传感器数据，实现高精度、强泛化能力的多故障同时诊断


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉复杂多模态信号关系，局限于单模态数据或单一故障类型，且在噪声或跨域条件下性能下降，需要更鲁棒的故障诊断方案

Method: MM-HCAN框架整合对比学习与超图拓扑，专门为多模态传感器融合设计，联合建模模态内和模态间依赖关系，超越欧几里得嵌入空间限制

Result: 在三个真实基准测试中达到99.82%准确率，具有强跨域泛化能力和噪声鲁棒性，消融研究验证了各组件贡献

Conclusion: MM-HCAN为工业环境中的全面多故障诊断提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，支持预测性维护和资产寿命延长

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

*Jiayuan Bai,Xuan-guang Pan,Chongyang Tao,Shuai Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JudgeSQL是一个通过结构化推理和加权共识锦标赛机制来改进SQL候选选择的新框架，解决了现有方法在测试时扩展中的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到SQL任务面临语义模糊性和复杂组合推理的挑战。虽然大语言模型通过提示、监督微调和强化调优推动了SQL生成，但测试时扩展暴露了新瓶颈：从多样化候选池中选择正确查询。现有选择方法（如自一致性或最佳N解码）仅提供浅层信号，容易导致不一致评分、脆弱推理链和无法捕捉细粒度语义差异。

Method: JudgeSQL开发了一个基于推理的SQL评判模型，通过可验证奖励引导的强化学习来提炼推理轨迹，实现准确且可解释的判断。在此基础上，加权共识锦标赛将显式推理偏好与隐式生成器置信度相结合。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，JudgeSQL展现出优越的SQL判断能力、良好的跨尺度泛化能力以及对生成器容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JudgeSQL通过结构化推理和加权共识机制，为SQL候选选择提供了一个更可靠和高效的解决方案，显著提升了文本到SQL任务的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个机器学习框架，整合患者历史就诊信息来改进健康监测，特别是在就诊次数有限且频率不规律的情况下。应用于前列腺癌风险预测，显著降低了假阳性率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学中的时间背景对于评估患者健康状况随时间变化至关重要，特别是在历史就诊数据有限且频率不规律的情况下，需要改进健康监测方法。

Method: 模型首先使用最近一次就诊的医疗数据估计疾病初始风险，然后利用先前收集的影像学和/或临床生物标志物信息来优化评估。

Result: 整合历史背景直接将假阳性转为真阴性，总体特异性提高同时保持高敏感性。整合最多三次先前影像检查时，假阳性率从51%降至33%；加入临床数据后进一步降至24%。预测5年内风险时，假阳性率从64%降至9%。

Conclusion: 随时间收集的信息提供了相关背景，能显著提高医学风险预测的特异性。对于多种进展性疾病，通过背景信息充分降低假阳性率可为大规模人群的纵向健康监测提供途径，实现早期检测和改善健康结果。

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

Conclusion: 该方法为连接知识与实验执行的可靠科学助手铺平了道路，所有数据、代码和模型将公开发布。

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in

\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable

automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --

Result: 建立了生成模型对齐中公平性和个性化的理论与算法框架，确保对多样化用户的公平性能保证。

Conclusion: 通过多响应排序和异质偏好处理，显著提升了生成模型对齐的公平性和个性化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

Motivation: 传统多模态方法存在两个主要限制：训练时需要同步所有模态数据，推理时依赖所有模态数据，这阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 将多模态学习建模为多目标优化问题，允许训练和推理时更灵活的模态要求；引入基于边界的类别重平衡策略来处理模态内不平衡问题。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，TRIP在异步设置下比最佳基线提升了16.48、6.89和11.55个百分点，在同步设置下提升了4.86和2.30个百分点。

Conclusion: TRIP框架在帕金森病评估中实现了最先进的性能，展示了其有效性和适应性，能够处理模态崩溃问题并增强类别学习。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GPT-4等大规模AI模型在关键领域部署，引发了关于AI系统信任和透明度的迫切问题，需要研究解释性与用户信任之间的关系。

Method: 采用定量实验设计，通过基于网页的交互式贷款审批模拟，比较从基本特征重要性到交互式反事实推理等不同类型的解释对用户信任的影响。

Result: 结果表明交互性增强了用户参与度和信心，解释的清晰度和相关性是信任的关键决定因素。

Conclusion: 为人本可解释AI领域提供了实证证据，强调了解释性设计对用户感知的可测量影响。

Abstract: Large-scale AI models such as GPT-4 have accelerated the deployment of
artificial intelligence across critical domains including law, healthcare, and
finance, raising urgent questions about trust and transparency. This study
investigates the relationship between explainability and user trust in AI
systems through a quantitative experimental design. Using an interactive,
web-based loan approval simulation, we compare how different types of
explanations, ranging from basic feature importance to interactive
counterfactuals influence perceived trust. Results suggest that interactivity
enhances both user engagement and confidence, and that the clarity and
relevance of explanations are key determinants of trust. These findings
contribute empirical evidence to the growing field of human-centered
explainable AI, highlighting measurable effects of explainability design on
user perception

TL;DR: Dialectica框架通过结构化对话、记忆和自我反思机制，使AI代理能够在复杂问题中发展专业知识，显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂多维度问题（如环境治理、司法决策）时，现有LLM缺乏通过经验积累专业知识的机制，需要开发能够从对话中学习的框架。

Method: 提出Dialectica框架，让代理在定义主题上进行结构化对话，配备记忆、自我反思和政策约束的上下文编辑功能，将讨论视为隐式元强化学习过程。

Result: 使用Qwen3:30b和OpenAI o4-mini的实验显示，基于反思的上下文编辑显著提升了代理在Elo评分、Bradley-Terry-Davidson能力和AlphaRank质量上的表现。

Conclusion: 对话驱动的上下文演化是在开放不可验证领域中实现针对性专业知识放大的可行路径。

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Motivation: 随着AI聊天机器人在临床医学中的应用增加，为复杂新兴疾病开发有效框架面临挑战，特别是长新冠这种新兴疾病。

Method: 开发并评估了六种RAG语料库配置，从专家精选来源到大规模文献数据库，使用LLM作为评判框架，在忠实性、相关性和全面性指标上进行评估。

Result: 结合临床指南和高质量系统评价的RAG配置始终优于单一指南方法和大规模文献数据库，在长新冠临床问答中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 对于新兴疾病，基于精选二次评价的检索在狭窄共识文档和未过滤原始文献之间提供了最佳平衡，支持临床决策同时避免信息过载和过度简化的指导。

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research
agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and
synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow
retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce
PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified
reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability.
PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from
AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward
signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction
adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further
enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool
failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This
highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce
efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents. The model and inference
