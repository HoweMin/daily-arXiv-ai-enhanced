### [1] [Mean-Field Games with Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11843)
*Anran Hu,Zijiu Lyu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了约束均值场博弈(CMFG)框架，将传统MFG扩展到包含约束的马尔可夫决策过程，建立了均衡存在性和唯一性理论，并开发了CMFOMO优化方法来计算均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均值场博弈模型无法处理代理策略受到可行性、安全性或监管限制的场景，需要扩展模型来捕捉这些现实约束。

Method: 开发了约束均值场占据测度优化(CMFOMO)方法，通过参数化占据测度将CMFG均衡求解转化为带凸约束的有界变量优化问题。

Result: 证明了CMFG均衡在严格可行性假设下的存在性，在单调性条件下的唯一性，并证明了CMFG均衡能诱导N人约束博弈的O(1/√N)-纳什均衡。

Conclusion: CMFG框架成功扩展了传统MFG模型，CMFOMO方法能有效计算所有均衡，数值实验验证了框架的有效性和灵活性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework of Constrained Mean-Field Games (CMFGs),
where each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). This
formulation captures scenarios in which agents' strategies are subject to
feasibility, safety, or regulatory restrictions, thereby extending the scope of
classical mean field game (MFG) models. We first establish the existence of
CMFG equilibria under a strict feasibility assumption, and we further show
uniqueness under a classical monotonicity condition. To compute equilibria, we
develop Constrained Mean-Field Occupation Measure Optimization (CMFOMO), an
optimization-based scheme that parameterizes occupation measures and shows that
finding CMFG equilibria is equivalent to solving a single optimization problem
with convex constraints and bounded variables. CMFOMO does not rely on
uniqueness of the equilibria and can approximate all equilibria with arbitrary
accuracy. We further prove that CMFG equilibria induce $O(1 / \sqrt{N})$-Nash
equilibria in the associated constrained $N$-player games, thereby extending
the classical justification of MFGs as approximations for large but finite
systems. Numerical experiments on a modified Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible
(SIS) epidemic model with various constraints illustrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of the framework.

### [2] [Linear Convergence of a Unified Primal--Dual Algorithm for Convex--Concave Saddle Point Problems with Quadratic Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11990)
*Cody Melcher,Afrooz Jalilzadeh,Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出广义加速原始对偶算法解决满足双向二次函数增长或二次梯度增长条件的鞍点问题，在放宽强凸-强凹要求下实现线性收敛


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鞍点问题求解需要强凸-强凹假设，限制了应用范围。本文旨在放宽这一要求，引入更一般的增长条件来涵盖更广泛的问题类别

Method: 提出广义加速原始对偶算法，统一并扩展现有方法，适用于非双线性目标函数的鞍点问题

Result: 在双向二次函数增长或二次梯度增长条件下，算法实现了线性收敛速率

Conclusion: 新提出的增长条件有效放宽了传统假设，提出的算法在更广泛的问题类别中保持线性收敛性能

Abstract: In this paper, we study saddle point (SP) problems, focusing on
convex-concave optimization involving functions that satisfy either two-sided
quadratic functional growth (QFG) or two-sided quadratic gradient growth
(QGG)--novel conditions tailored specifically for SP problems as extensions of
quadratic growth conditions in minimization. These conditions relax the
traditional requirement of strong convexity-strong concavity, thereby
encompassing a broader class of problems. We propose a generalized accelerated
primal-dual (GAPD) algorithm to solve SP problems with non-bilinear objective
functions, unifying and extending existing methods. We prove that our method
achieves a linear convergence rate under these relaxed conditions.
Additionally, we provide examples of structured SP problems that satisfy either
two-sided QFG or QGG, demonstrating the practical applicability and relevance
of our approach.

### [3] [Distributed Stochastic Model Predictive Control with Temporal Aggregation for the Joint Dispatch of Cascaded Hydropower and Renewables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11998)
*Luca Santosuosso,Sonja Wogrin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合时间序列聚合和分布式随机模型预测控制的新方法，用于解决水电-风电-光伏混合系统的实时能量调度问题，相比传统集中式方法减少了42%的执行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于场景的随机模型预测控制在处理水电-风电-光伏混合系统时面临严重的计算瓶颈，因为控制问题在时间、资产和场景维度上的复杂性。

Method: 将时间序列聚合技术应用于MPC预测时域的尾部以保持实时精度，同时采用分布式优化实现跨资产和场景的分解。

Result: 在实际案例研究中，该控制器相比集中式全尺度MPC实现了42%的执行时间减少，并通过理论验证的近似误差界限提供正式性能保证。

Conclusion: 所提出的控制方案有效解决了混合能源系统实时调度的计算挑战，在保持精度的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: This paper addresses the real-time energy dispatch of a hybrid system
comprising cascaded hydropower plants, wind, and solar units, jointly
participating in the day-ahead energy market under inflow, renewable
generation, and price uncertainties. Traditional scenario-based stochastic
model predictive control (MPC) faces severe computational bottlenecks due to
the complexity arising from the temporal, asset, and scenario dimensions of
this control problem. To address this, we propose a novel control scheme that
combines time series aggregation (TSA) with distributed stochastic MPC. TSA is
applied exclusively to the tail of the MPC prediction horizon to preserve
real-time accuracy, while distributed optimization enables decomposition across
assets and scenarios. Notably, the controller offers a formal performance
guarantee through theoretically validated bounds on its approximation error.
Simulations on a real-world case study confirm the controller's effectiveness,
achieving a 42% reduction in execution time compared to centralized full-scale
MPC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半无限规划在非凸和大规模优化中的理论发展有限，本文针对对抗鲁棒性和安全约束学习等应用中的非凸无限约束min-max问题进行研究

Method: 提出了一种新的不精确动态障碍原始对偶算法，在平方不可行残差函数满足Lojasiewicz不等式的假设下分析收敛性

Result: 证明了该方法达到ε-近似平稳性、不可行性和互补松弛性的迭代复杂度分别为O(ε^-3)、O(ε^-6θ)和O(ε^-3θ/(1-θ))

Conclusion: 该算法在理论分析和数值实验中都表现出有效性，特别适用于鲁棒多任务学习等实际问题

Abstract: Semi-Infinite Programming (SIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
modeling problems with infinite constraints, however, its theoretical
development in the context of nonconvex and large-scale optimization remains
limited. In this paper, we investigate a class of nonconvex min-max
optimization problems with nonconvex infinite constraints, motivated by
applications such as adversarial robustness and safety-constrained learning. We
propose a novel inexact dynamic barrier primal-dual algorithm and establish its
convergence properties. Specifically, under the assumption that the squared
infeasibility residual function satisfies the Lojasiewicz inequality with
exponent $\theta \in (0,1)$, we prove that the proposed method achieves
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$, $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-6\theta})$, and
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3\theta/(1-\theta)})$ iteration complexities to achieve
an $\epsilon$-approximate stationarity, infeasibility, and complementarity
slackness, respectively. Numerical experiments on robust multitask learning
with task priority further illustrate the practical effectiveness of the
algorithm.

TL;DR: 本文研究了非单调变分不等式问题的邻近梯度下降算法的局部线性收敛性，通过间隙函数重构和误差界条件分析，建立了在可验证条件下的局部线性收敛结果，并提出了用于非单调仿射VI的全局收敛同伦延拓方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非单调变分不等式问题，特别是在不假设Minty型解存在的情况下，开发有效的算法来求解这类问题，应用于纳什均衡、交通控制和GAN模型等实际问题。

Method: 使用邻近梯度下降算法，基于参数化间隙函数重构非单调VI问题；引入并研究各种误差界条件；建立层次化误差界结构；提出同伦延拓方案实现全局收敛。

Result: 在水平集误差界、梯度Lipschitz条件和适当初始化条件下建立了局部线性收敛性；数值实验验证了所提方法在纳什均衡、交通控制和GAN模型等非单调VI问题中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效求解广泛类别的非单调变分不等式问题，通过误差界分析和同伦延拓技术实现了局部线性收敛和全局收敛，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the local linear convergence behavior of
proximal-gradient (PG) descent algorithm on a parameterized gap-function
reformulation of a smooth but non-monotone variational inequality problem
(VIP). The aim is to solve the non-monotone VI problem without assuming the
existence of a Minty-type solution. We first introduce and study various error
bound conditions for the gap functions in relation to the VI model. In
particular, we show that uniform type error bounds imply level-set type error
bounds for composite optimization, revealing a key hierarchical structure
there. As a result, local linear convergence is established under some
easy-verifiable conditions induced by level-set error bounds, the gradient
Lipschitz condition and a suitable initialization condition. Furthermore, for
non-monotone affine VIs we present a homotopy continuation scheme that achieves
global convergence by dynamically tracing a solution path. Our numerical
experiments show the efficacy of the proposed approach, leading to the
solutions of a broad class of non-monotone VI problems resulting from the need
to compute Nash equilibria, traffic controls, and the GAN models.

### [6] [Learning Mean-Field Games through Mean-Field Actor-Critic Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12180)
*Mo Zhou,Haosheng Zhou,Ruimeng Hu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了Mean-Field Actor-Critic (MFAC)流，一种结合强化学习和最优传输的连续时间学习动态，用于求解平均场博弈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够联合演化控制策略、价值函数和分布分量的框架，通过耦合的梯度更新来有效计算平均场博弈均衡。

Method: 结合强化学习（actor-critic）和最优传输技术，通过偏微分方程控制的耦合梯度更新，并引入最优传输测地线Picard流使分布沿Wasserstein-2测地线向均衡演化。

Result: 使用Lyapunov泛函进行严格的收敛性分析，在合适的时间尺度下建立了MFAC流的全局指数收敛性，数值实验验证了理论结果和框架有效性。

Conclusion: MFAC框架成功展示了actor、critic和分布分量之间的算法交互作用，为计算平均场博弈均衡提供了有效的连续时间学习动态。

Abstract: We propose the Mean-Field Actor-Critic (MFAC) flow, a continuous-time
learning dynamics for solving mean-field games (MFGs), combining techniques
from reinforcement learning and optimal transport. The MFAC framework jointly
evolves the control (actor), value function (critic), and distribution
components through coupled gradient-based updates governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs). A central innovation is the Optimal Transport
Geodesic Picard (OTGP) flow, which drives the distribution toward equilibrium
along Wasserstein-2 geodesics. We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis using
Lyapunov functionals and establish global exponential convergence of the MFAC
flow under a suitable timescale. Our results highlight the algorithmic
interplay among actor, critic, and distribution components. Numerical
experiments illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the MFAC framework in computing MFG equilibria.

### [7] [A Gradient Guided Diffusion Framework for Chance Constrained Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12238)
*Boyang Zhang,Zhiguo Wang,Ya-Feng Liu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: GGDOpt是一个基于梯度引导扩散的优化框架，用于解决机会约束规划问题，无需知道不确定性的确切分布，仅依赖样本集，通过扩散过程凸化非凸可行域，在合成数据集和无线通信波形设计任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机会约束规划在处理不确定性优化问题时很强大，但现有方法通常需要知道不确定性的确切分布，且难以处理非凸约束。GGDOpt旨在克服这些限制。

Method: 将CCP重新表述为两个分布的乘积采样问题：未知数据分布和Boltzmann分布，利用一阶和二阶梯度信息，通过前向扩散过程注入噪声凸化非凸可行域，然后进行引导反向采样。

Result: 在合成数据集和无线通信波形设计任务中，GGDOpt在解质量和稳定性方面优于现有方法，开销减少近80%。

Conclusion: GGDOpt提供了一个处理广泛CCP问题的有效框架，具有理论收敛保证和实际误差界，在多个应用场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Chance constrained programming (CCP) is a powerful framework for addressing
optimization problems under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Gradient-Guided Diffusion-based Optimization framework, termed GGDOpt, which
tackles CCP through three key innovations. First, GGDOpt accommodates a broad
class of CCP problems without requiring the knowledge of the exact distribution
of uncertainty-relying solely on a set of samples. Second, to address the
nonconvexity of the chance constraints, it reformulates the CCP as a sampling
problem over the product of two distributions: an unknown data distribution
supported on a nonconvex set and a Boltzmann distribution defined by the
objective function, which fully leverages both first- and second-order gradient
information. Third, GGDOpt has theoretical convergence guarantees and provides
practical error bounds under mild assumptions. By progressively injecting noise
during the forward diffusion process to convexify the nonconvex feasible
region, GGDOpt enables guided reverse sampling to generate asymptotically
optimal solutions. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and a waveform
design task in wireless communications demonstrate that GGDOpt outperforms
existing methods in both solution quality and stability with nearly 80%
overhead reduction.

### [8] [Bilateral facial reduction: qualification-free subdifferential calculus and exact duality in convex analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12244)
*Matthew S. Scott*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个几何框架，通过定义联合面性子空间来扩展凸分析结果，无需标准限定条件。该框架允许在相对内部不相交的情况下应用经典定理，并推广了次微分可加性、法锥交集等结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统凸分析需要相对内部相交等限定条件，限制了理论应用范围。本文旨在建立一个几何框架，超越这些标准条件，使经典凸分析定理能在更广泛情况下应用。

Method: 定义联合面性子空间T作为由0生成的C-D面的张成空间，其仿射平移T_a包含C∩D。通过将凸函数定义域约简到T_a，确保相对内部相交，从而无限制地应用经典定理。

Result: 建立了双边面约简框架，推广了次微分可加性、法锥交集、次微分链式法则、达到的下卷积和对偶理论。提供了T的特征化方法和计算过程，在R^n中最多n步收敛。

Conclusion: 提出的几何框架成功扩展了凸分析结果的应用范围，无需标准限定条件。新概念如面性子空间和嵌套法线为描述凸边界和面格提供了有力工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric framework to extend convex analysis results
beyond standard qualification conditions such as intersecting relative
interiors of domains. We define the joint facial subspace $T$ as the span of
the face of $C - D$ generated by $0$, with its affine translation $T_a$
containing $C \cap D$. The intersections $C \cap T_a$ and $D \cap T_a$ are
faces of the original sets, establishing $T_a$ as a bilateral facial reduction
with parallels to Borwein-Wolkowicz facial reduction in conic programming. When
reducing the domains of two convex functions to their joint facial subspace
$T_a$, their relative interiors then always intersect, enabling unqualified
application of classical theorems via localization. Key generalizations include
subdifferential additivity, normal cones of intersections, a subdifferential
chain rule, attained infimal convolution for $(f+g)^*,$ and an exact
Fenchel-Rockafellar dual. We characterize $T$ via generated faces and
computationally through an iterative process converging in at most $n$ steps in
$\mathbb{R}^n$. Proofs are self-contained and introduce novel concepts like
facial subspaces and nested normals to describe convex boundaries and the
lattice of faces.

### [9] [Adaptive Nonlinear Model Predictive Control of Monoclonal Antibody Glycosylation in CHO Cell Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12333)
*Yingjie Ma,Jing Guo,Alexis B. Dubs,Krystian K. Ganko,Richard D. Braatz*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自适应非线性模型预测控制(ANMPC)框架，用于在单克隆抗体生产过程中主动调控N-糖基化分布，通过在线更新模型参数和缩小范围优化实现了比开环优化和静态NMPC更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 控制单克隆抗体的N-糖基化具有挑战性，因为糖基化途径复杂、在线测量有限且缺乏定制化的控制策略，这影响了抗体药物的质量属性。

Method: 采用自适应非线性模型预测控制框架，使用多尺度模型连接细胞外条件与细胞内高尔基体反应来预测糖谱，在线更新模型参数并进行缩小范围优化计算控制输入。

Result: 案例研究表明，ANMPC能够减轻模型-实际不匹配，性能比开环优化和静态NMPC分别高出130%和96%，在部分测量可用和较长准备时间的实际条件下仍保持可比性能。

Conclusion: ANMPC能够主动调控糖基化分布，为单克隆抗体糖基化的闭环控制提供了可行路径。

Abstract: N-glycosylation is a critical quality attribute of monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs), the dominant class of biopharmaceuticals. Controlling glycosylation
remains difficult due to intrinsic pathway complexity, limited online
measurements, and a lack of tailored control strategies. This work applies an
adaptive nonlinear model predictive control (ANMPC) framework to a fed-batch
mAb production process, using a multiscale model that links extracellular
conditions to intracellular Golgi reactions to predict glycan profiles. Model
parameters are updated online as new measurements arrive, after which a
shrinking-horizon optimization computes the control inputs; only the first
control move is implemented each cycle. Case studies show that, with a minimal
day-1 galactose excitation, ANMPC mitigates model-plant mismatch and achieves
up to 130% and 96% higher performance than open-loop optimization and state
NMPC, respectively. Under more realistic conditions (partial measurement
availability and longer preparation time), ANMPC maintains comparable
performance, indicating robustness to practical limitations. Overall, the
results demonstrate that ANMPC can actively shape glycan distributions in
silico and offers a viable path toward closed-loop control of mAb
glycosylation.

### [10] [Carleman Estimates and Controllability of Forward Stochastic Parabolic Equations with General Dynamic Boundary Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12345)
*Said Boulite,Abdellatif Elgrou,Lahcen Maniar,Abdelaziz Rhandi*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文推导了具有动态边界条件的后向随机抛物方程的新Carleman估计，并应用于证明前向随机抛物方程的零可控性和近似可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具有动态边界条件和弱散度源项的随机抛物方程的可控性问题，填补现有理论在处理这类复杂边界条件和源项时的空白。

Method: 通过两个主要步骤：首先改进已知的后向随机抛物方程Carleman估计以明确参数对最终控制时间T的依赖；其次应用对偶技术处理弱散度源项。

Result: 成功证明了具有反应项、对流项和一般二阶抛物算子的前向随机抛物方程的零可控性和近似可控性，并给出了零可控性成本的显式估计。

Conclusion: 所提出的Carleman估计方法有效解决了具有动态边界条件和弱散度源项的随机抛物方程的可控性问题，为相关控制理论提供了新的工具。

Abstract: We derive a new Carleman estimate for a general backward stochastic parabolic
equation with dynamic boundary conditions, incorporating weak divergence source
terms in both the bulk and surface equations. This estimate is obtained through
two main steps: first, by refining a known Carleman estimate for backward
stochastic parabolic equations to explicitly account for the dependence of the
parameters on the final control time \(T\); second, by applying a duality
technique to address weak divergence source terms. As an application, we prove
the null and approximate controllability of forward stochastic parabolic
equations with dynamic boundary conditions, which involve both reaction and
convection terms with bounded adapted coefficients, as well as general
second-order parabolic operators. Additionally, we provide an explicit estimate
for the null-controllability cost in terms of the final control time \(T\) and
the coefficients of the equation.

### [11] [Heuristic Bundle Upper Bound Based Polyhedral Bundle Method for Semidefinite Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12374)
*Zilong Cui,Ran Gu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的多面体束方法，通过限制束的数量来提高半定规划问题的求解效率，在Max-Cut问题和随机稀疏SDP问题上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半定规划(SDP)是凸优化的重要类别，但传统方法在迭代过程中线性约束数量持续增加，导致求解效率显著降低。

Method: 基于限制束数量上界的思想，根据原始最优解的秩通过数值实验启发式选择上界，提出改进的子问题，在保证下近似模型逼近能力的前提下最小化束数量。

Result: 算法在Max-Cut问题和随机SDP问题上表现良好，特别对于条件数较低的随机稀疏SDP问题，在相对精度10^-4条件下相比内点法等算法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 改进的多面体束方法能有效提高SDP问题的求解效率，特别是在特定类型的SDP问题上展现出明显优势。

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a fundamental class of convex optimization
problems with diverse applications in mathematics, engineering, machine
learning, and related disciplines. This paper investigates the application of
the polyhedral bundle method to standard SDPs. The basic idea of this method is
to approximate semidefinite constraints using linear constraints, and thereby
transform the SDP problem into a series of quadratic programming subproblems.
However, the number of linear constraints often increases continuously during
the iteration process, leading to a significant reduction in the solution
efficiency. Therefore, based on the idea of limiting the upper bound on the
number of bundles, we heuristically select the upper bound through numerical
experiments according to the rank of the primal optimal solution and propose a
modified subproblem. In this way, under the premise of ensuring the
approximation ability of the lower approximation model, we minimize the number
of bundles as much as possible to improve the solution efficiency of the
subproblems. The algorithm performs well in both Max-Cut problems and random
SDP problems. In particular, for random sparse SDP problems with low condition
numbers, under the condition of a relative accuracy of \(10^{-4}\), it shows a
significant improvement compared with algorithms such as interior-point
methods.

### [12] [Tensor Completion via Monotone Inclusion: Generalized Low-Rank Priors Meet Deep Denoisers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12425)
*Peng Chen,Deliang Wei,Jiale Yao,Fang Li*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单调包含范式的张量补全框架GTCTV-DPC，将广义低秩先验与深度伪压缩去噪器相结合，并严格证明了其全局收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多维数据中的缺失条目给实际应用带来挑战，现有方法依赖经验收敛或不切实际的假设（如深度去噪器作为隐式正则化的邻近算子），需要更严格的理论基础。

Method: 基于Davis-Yin分裂方案，开发了GTCTV-DPC算法，统一了广义低秩先验和深度伪压缩去噪器，扩展了传统凸优化方法。

Result: 大量实验表明GTCTV-DPC在定量指标和视觉质量上始终优于现有方法，特别是在低采样率下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 该框架为张量补全提供了理论严谨且性能优越的解决方案，特别适用于低采样率场景。

Abstract: Missing entries in multi dimensional data pose significant challenges for
downstream analysis across diverse real world applications. These data are
naturally modeled as tensors, and recent completion methods integrating global
low rank priors with plug and play denoisers have demonstrated strong empirical
performance. However, these approaches often rely on empirical convergence
alone or unrealistic assumptions, such as deep denoisers acting as proximal
operators of implicit regularizers, which generally does not hold. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel tensor completion framework grounded in
the monotone inclusion paradigm, which unifies generalized low rank priors with
deep pseudo contractive denoisers and extends beyond traditional convex
optimization. Building on the Davis Yin splitting scheme, we develop the GTCTV
DPC algorithm and rigorously establish its global convergence. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GTCTV DPC consistently outperforms existing
methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly at low
sampling rates.

### [13] [The value of storage in electricity distribution: The role of storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12435)
*Dirk Lauinger,Deepjyoti Deka,Sungho Shin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 开发了一个优化框架来建模电力市场中储能参与约束，发现在马萨诸塞州案例中，市场参与能带来与峰值需求削减相似的节省，但在当前条件下不会增加储能投资。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在放松管制的电力市场中，配电公司部署的储能系统常常闲置，因为监管约束禁止其参与电力市场，这造成了资源浪费。

Method: 开发了一个包含市场参与约束的储能投资和运营规划的优化框架，这是首个正式建模此类约束的方法。

Result: 市场参与能提供与峰值需求削减相似的节省；在当前条件下不会增加储能投资；在极低储能成本下可能激励超出本地配电需求的部署。

Conclusion: 该框架可以识别适合本地配电需求的投资水平，但储能过度部署可能与放松管制市场中配电与发电分离的原则相冲突。

Abstract: Electricity distribution companies deploy battery storage to defer grid
upgrades by reducing peak demand. In deregulated jurisdictions, such storage
often sits idle because regulatory constraints bar participation in electricity
markets. Here, we develop an optimization framework that, to our knowledge,
provides the first formal model of market participation constraints within
storage investment and operation planning. Applying the framework to a
Massachusetts case study, we find that market participation could deliver
similar savings as peak demand reduction. Under current conditions, market
participation does not increase storage investment, but at very low storage
costs, could incentivize deployment beyond local distribution needs. This might
run contrary to the separation of distribution from generation in deregulated
markets. Our framework can identify investment levels appropriate for local
distribution needs.

### [14] [Micro-Macro Backstepping Control of Large-Scale Hyperbolic Systems (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12456)

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于大规模双曲PDE系统微宏观边界控制的框架，开发了多种基于连续体近似的反馈控制律，并建立了稳定性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模双曲PDE系统的边界控制问题，通过连续体近似方法来简化复杂系统的控制设计。

Method: 使用连续体PDE反步变换构造反馈控制律，建立4维核方程并证明其适定性，通过李雅普诺夫函数分析闭环稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce a control design and analysis framework for micro-macro,
boundary control of large-scale, $n+m$ hyperbolic PDE systems. Specifically, we
develop feedback laws for stabilization of hyperbolic systems at the micro
level (i.e., of the large-scale system) that employ a) measurements obtained
from the $n+m$ system (i.e., at micro level) and kernels constructed based on
an $\infty+\infty$ continuum system counterpart (i.e., at macro level), or b)
kernels and measurements both stemming from a continuum counterpart, or c)
averaged-continuum kernels/measurements. We also address (d)) stabilization of
the continuum (macro) system, employing continuum kernels and measurements.
Towards addressing d) we derive in a constructive manner an $\infty+\infty$
continuum approximation of $n+m$ hyperbolic systems and establish that its
solutions approximate, for large $n$ and $m$, the solutions of the $n+m$
system. We then construct a feedback law for stabilization of the
$\infty+\infty$ system via introduction of a continuum-PDE backstepping
transformation. We establish well-posedness of the resulting 4-D kernel
equations and prove closed-loop stability via construction of a novel Lyapunov
functional. Furthermore, under control configuration a) we establish that the
closed-loop system is exponentially stable provided that $n$ and $m$ are large,
by proving that the exact, stabilizing $n+m$ control kernels can be accurately
approximated by the continuum kernels. While under control configurations b)
and c), we establish closed-loop stability capitalizing on the established
solutions' and kernels' approximation properties via employment of
infinite-dimensional ISS arguments. We provide two numerical simulation
examples to illustrate the effectiveness and potential limitations of our
design approach.

Conclusion: 提出的时间离散化模型在线性规划松弛方面表现优越，虽然问题规模增大，但通过列生成可以有效处理，为周期性时刻表优化提供了新方法。

Abstract: Periodic timetabling for public transportation networks is typically modelled
as a Periodic Event Scheduling Problem (PESP). Solving instances of the
benchmark library PESPlib to optimality continues to pose a challenge. As a
further approach towards this goal, we remodel the problem by a time
discretization of the underlying graph and consider arc-based as well as
path-based integer programming formulations. For the path-based case, we use
cycles on the graph expansion of the operational lines as variables and,
therefore, include more of the problem inherent structure into the model. A
consequence is the validity of several known inequalities and a lower bound on
the LP-relaxation, that is the best known to date. As an extension we integrate
passenger routing into the new model. The proposed models have an advantage in
the linear programming relaxation, on the one hand, but have an increased
problem size, on the other hand. We define the corresponding pricing problems
for the use of column generation to handle the size. Both models are
practically tested on different problem instances.

TL;DR: 本文研究了时变优化中基于梯度算法的基本性能极限，揭示了问题条件数、时间变化复杂度和收敛速率之间的基本权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究时变优化问题中梯度算法的性能极限，探索时间变化对收敛速率的内在限制。

Method: 利用内部模型原理和根轨迹技术分析时变优化问题，构建显式控制器来达到理论边界。

Result: 对于条件数为κ、时间变化模型阶数为n的问题，任何最小阶梯度算法的最坏收敛率为ρ_TV = ((κ-1)/(κ+1))^(1/n)。

Conclusion: 时间变化在梯度优化中施加了内在收敛速率限制，该界限在低阶时间变化模型中是可达到的。

Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental performance limits of gradient-based
algorithms for time-varying optimization. Leveraging the internal model
principle and root locus techniques, we show that temporal variabilities impose
intrinsic limits on the achievable rate of convergence. For a problem with
condition ratio $\kappa$ and time variation whose model has degree $n$, we show
that the worst-case convergence rate of any minimal-order gradient-based
algorithm is $\rho_\text{TV} = (\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa+1})^{1/n}$. This bound
reveals a fundamental tradeoff between problem conditioning, temporal
complexity, and rate of convergence. We further construct explicit controllers
that attain the bound for low-degree models of time variation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ProtoDoctor框架，通过原型学习实现ICU死亡率预测，整合临床病程识别、人口异质性和预后意识三个关键要素，提供内在可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU死亡率预测不仅需要预测准确性，还需要可解释性来建立临床信任和满足监管要求。现有方法主要关注人口异质性，忽视了临床病程识别和预后意识。

Method: ProtoDoctor包含两个关键创新模块：预后临床病程识别模块（通过原型学习识别临床病程，使用新的正则化机制实现预后意识）和人口异质性识别模块（通过队列特定原型和风险调整建模人口异质性）。

Result: 广泛的实证评估表明ProtoDoctor在预测准确性上优于最先进的基线方法。人工评估进一步证实其解释在ICU实践中更具临床意义、可信度和适用性。

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor成功整合了ICU决策实践中的三个关键要素，提供了内在可解释性，并在预测准确性和临床实用性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定问题集进行昂贵的在线强化学习或专家迭代，导致训练效率低下且难以处理复杂问题。

Method: GAR框架包含问题生成器和求解器，在对抗循环中联合训练，通过隐式课程学习机制使任务难度与证明者能力相匹配。

Result: 在MiniF2F-Test基准上平均相对提升4.20%，ProofNet-Test上pass@32从22.58%提升至25.81%。

Conclusion: GAR建立了可验证环境下问题生成与求解协同进化的一般强化学习范式，超越了形式化证明的应用范围。

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 节点级异常检测面临结构模式和特征分布多样性的挑战，在欺诈检测、网络安全和推荐系统等应用中至关重要。现有方法难以有效捕捉复杂异常模式。

Method: 每个节点由原始特征和结构特征（随机游走和度）两个视图描述，分别嵌入到欧几里得和双曲空间。采用多图自编码器框架，配备对比学习目标作为正则化项，对齐不同几何空间的嵌入。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，Janus持续优于浅层和深层基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合多种几何表示提供了一种鲁棒且有效的方法来识别图中微妙和复杂的异常。

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

TL;DR: 本文提出软约束薛定谔桥问题(SCSBP)，通过用惩罚函数替代硬终端约束来解决经典薛定谔桥问题在实际实现中的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典薛定谔桥问题(SBP)在生成式AI中有重要应用，但其硬终端约束在高维或数据稀缺情况下会导致实现不稳定。

Method: 采用软约束薛定谔桥问题框架，将终端约束替换为一般惩罚函数，建立McKean-Vlasov型随机控制公式。

Result: 证明了所有惩罚水平下最优解的存在性，并证明当惩罚增大时，控制和值函数以线性速率收敛到经典SBP的解。

Conclusion: 软约束桥不仅提供了首个定量收敛保证，还揭示了惩罚正则化如何实现鲁棒的生成建模、微调和迁移学习。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的无梯度训练数据影响估计方法，仅需中间检查点的损失值和检查点本身，显著降低了计算和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在大模型上计算成本过高，难以扩展到实际应用，需要更高效的训练数据影响估计技术。

Method: 基于零阶近似，仅使用训练和测试数据的损失值以及模型检查点，无需梯度或逆Hessian计算。

Result: 在估计自影响方面达到更高精度，在训练-测试影响估计方面达到相当或更好的精度，同时大幅降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模模型提供了可扩展且实用的训练数据分析工具，特别适用于非可微损失函数场景。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

TL;DR: 提出Boundary Guidance方法，通过强化学习微调生成模型，使其远离分类器的决策边界，从而在保持安全性的同时提升输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过微调生成模型来降低被安全分类器过滤的概率，但这往往使模型输出靠近分类器决策边界，导致假阳性和假阴性增加。

Method: 使用强化学习进行微调，明确引导生成远离分类器的边界区域。

Result: 在越狱和模糊提示基准测试中，Boundary Guidance在LLM-as-a-Judge评估中同时提升了输出的安全性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模和奖励设计下都表现出鲁棒性，为生成模型的安全优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列生成模型局限于时域或频域，难以再现真实世界时间序列固有的多尺度结构，而大型高质量时间序列数据集稀缺。

Method: 在小波系数上训练扩散模型，结合每层专用变压器和跨层注意力机制，通过自适应门控实现时频尺度间的选择性信息交换，并基于Parseval定理加入能量保持约束。

Result: 在能源、金融和神经科学等六个真实数据集上的测试表明，WaveletDiff在五个不同性能指标上始终优于最先进的时域和频域生成方法，判别分数和Context-FID分数平均比第二好的基线小3倍。

Conclusion: WaveletDiff通过利用小波变换的多分辨率特性，有效地生成了高质量的时间序列数据，在多个领域和指标上都表现出色。

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

Conclusion: 开源视觉语言模型在多模态讽刺检测方面有潜力，但在解释生成能力上仍需改进，需要进一步的任务特定优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

<details>

Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入方法大多基于封闭世界假设或局部封闭世界假设，将缺失三元组视为假，这与现实世界知识图谱的开放世界假设不符。显式负陈述有助于区分假三元组和未知三元组，但很少被包含在知识图谱中且在嵌入训练中被忽视。

Method: 采用双模型架构，两个嵌入模型并行训练，一个处理正陈述，另一个处理负陈述。训练过程中，每个模型通过破坏正样本生成负样本，并使用另一个模型的评分选择最可能的候选样本。

Result: 在通用和领域特定知识图谱上的广泛实验表明，该方法在链接预测和三元组分类任务上优于最先进的嵌入模型，证明了将有意义负知识整合到嵌入学习中的价值。

Conclusion: 提出的双模型方法通过有效整合显式负陈述，显著提升了知识图谱嵌入的性能，为处理开放世界假设下的知识图谱提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

TL;DR: 提出了CART框架，这是首个增强决策变换器在对抗性随机游戏中鲁棒性的方法，通过将每个阶段的交互建模为阶段博弈，并基于NashQ值生成策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer架构已成功应用于序列决策，但基于序列建模的强化学习方法在对抗性鲁棒性方面尚未充分探索，需要开发能够抵御对抗攻击的鲁棒策略。

Method: 将每个阶段的主角与对手交互建模为阶段博弈，定义收益为后续状态的最大期望值，基于这些阶段博弈的NashQ值来条件化Transformer策略。

Result: CART在对抗性随机游戏中实现了更准确的最小最大值估计，并在各种对抗环境中持续获得更优的最坏情况回报。

Conclusion: CART框架成功增强了决策变换器的对抗鲁棒性，通过显式处理随机状态转移和阶段博弈，生成了既不易被利用又对转移不确定性保守的策略。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示为模型不确定性下的鲁棒RL提供了高效且原则性的替代方案。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将个人事件（序列建模）和关系事件（图建模）分开处理，但现实系统需要同时捕捉这两种事件类型，缺乏公开数据集和统一建模方法

Method: 引入包含个人和关系事件的数据集集合，提出统一的形式化方法，实证验证结合两种事件类型的优势

Result: 模型在结合两种事件类型时表现更好，但现有方法仍有显著改进空间

Conclusion: 发布了支持统一用户事件建模的资源，鼓励该方向的研究进展

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

TL;DR: 提出VMoGE方法，通过变分图神经网络专家模型整合频率特异性生物标志物识别和结构化变分推理，显著提升痴呆症亚型和严重程度分期的诊断准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆等痴呆症在EEG中表现出重叠的电生理特征，现有基于EEG的方法受限于全频带分析，难以精确区分痴呆亚型和严重程度阶段。

Method: VMoGE采用多粒度transformer提取四个频带的多尺度时间模式，然后使用高斯马尔可夫随机场先验的变分图卷积编码器，通过结构化变分推理和自适应门控将神经专业化与生理意义的EEG频带联系起来。

Result: 在两个不同数据集上的评估显示，VMoGE在亚型分类和严重程度分期方面均优于现有方法，AUC提升4%到10%，并提供与临床指标相关的可解释性专家权重。

Conclusion: VMoGE为全面痴呆诊断和监测提供了EEG生物标志物发现的有效工具，通过可解释的洞察促进临床应用。

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

TL;DR: Locaris是一种基于解码器大型语言模型的室内定位系统，将Wi-Fi接入点测量视为标记，无需预处理即可处理原始Wi-Fi遥测数据，实现了无需校准的室内定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统室内Wi-Fi定位方法对环境动态、信道传播特性和硬件异构性高度敏感，需要大量人工校准且性能容易退化。

Method: 通过在不同Wi-Fi数据集上微调LLM，Locaris学习从原始信号直接到设备位置的轻量级可泛化映射，将每个AP测量视为标记。

Result: 实验表明Locaris在各种遥测类型上匹配或超越现有技术，仅用几百个样本即可实现亚米级精度，在缺失AP情况下仍保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 紧凑型LLM可作为室内定位的无校准回归模型，在大规模部署中提供可扩展和稳健的跨环境性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Mao等人(2022)的RestartQ-UCB算法中存在的两个核心问题：完全遗忘（重启后丢失所有环境信息）和预定重启（不考虑策略与当前环境动态的不兼容性）。

Method: 引入了三种重启方法：部分重启、自适应重启和选择性重启，用于改进RestartQ-UCB和RANDOMIZEDQ算法。

Result: 在多种不同环境中获得了接近最优的实证性能，相比RestartQ-UCB算法降低了高达91%的动态遗憾。

Conclusion: 提出的三种重启范式能有效解决非平稳强化学习中的重启设计问题，显著提升算法性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

Motivation: 研究高效可计算函数与神经网络表示之间的关系，探索如何通过组合稀疏结构来逼近可计算函数。

Method: 通过将高效可计算函数转换为有界扇入布尔电路，然后用常数大小的神经网络模拟器替换每个门，构建深度网络。

Conclusion: 高效可计算性与组合稀疏神经网络表示之间存在深刻联系，这为理解深度学习的能力和优化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分自编码器（VAE）使用KL散度惩罚来鼓励潜在空间匹配因子化高斯先验，但作者发现这种KL正则化机制不可靠，无法在聚合后验上强制执行目标分布。

Method: 提出了可编程先验框架，基于最大均值差异（MMD）构建，允许显式塑造潜在空间。同时开发了无监督的潜在可预测性评分（LPS）来量化解纠缠效果。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和Tiny ImageNet等复杂数据集上实现了最先进的相互独立性，且没有常见的重建权衡问题。该框架还能构建复杂先验以改善与语义特征的对应关系。

Conclusion: 这项工作为表示工程提供了基础工具，为模型可识别性和因果推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Motivation: 现代连续时间生成模型通常诱导V形传输：每个样本沿着几乎笔直的轨迹从先验到数据独立移动，忽略了共享结构。

Method: 引入Y形生成流，基于具有次线性指数（0到1之间）的新型速度驱动传输成本，这种凹依赖奖励联合和快速的质量移动，并在可扩展的神经ODE训练目标中实例化该思想。

Result: 在合成、图像和生物学数据集上，Y流恢复了层次感知结构，在分布度量上优于强流基线方法，并以更少的积分步骤达到目标。

Conclusion: Y形生成流通过共享路径和分支结构有效捕获数据中的层次结构，提高了生成模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的预训练过程存在不同学习速度阶段，但之前的后训练加速方法完全忽略了这一特性。本研究旨在利用预训练动态来指导加速策略。

Method: 采用轨迹感知的结构剪枝方法，根据预训练不同阶段的学习速度进行自适应剪枝：中间快速学习阶段采用保守剪枝保护关键特征，早期和后期慢速学习阶段采用更激进的剪枝策略。

Result: 在DiT和SDXL上的广泛实验表明，该方法在采样速度上实现了显著提升，且不损害输出质量，大幅优于之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法首次明确反映了扩散预训练固有的学习速度变化，为更高效和鲁棒的无训练扩散加速提供了新视角。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) 是一种简单的一行代码修改，只在参数坐标与优化器更新方向一致时应用权重衰减，无需新超参数即可提升语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解耦衰减隐式优化正则化或约束目标，而CWD旨在保持原始损失函数，寻找未修改目标的局部帕累托最优平稳点。

Method: CWD是优化器无关的修改，仅对与优化器更新方向一致的参数坐标应用权重衰减，可解释为双层优化问题，在到达平稳流形时诱导滑动模式行为。

Result: 在百万到十亿参数规模的语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类任务中，CWD持续改善了最终损失和准确率。

Conclusion: CWD是一种即插即用的改进方法，适用于AdamW、Lion和Muon等优化器，无需额外调参即可提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

Result: 通过玩具Transformer的概念验证，展示了QLENS能够研究各层在模型预测轨迹中的影响。

Conclusion: QLENS为跨领域洞察提供了基础，有助于更广泛地理解Transformer模型。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

Conclusion: 该研究为具有交叉上下文最小奖励约束的多臂老虎机问题提供了有效的算法解决方案，证明了时间依赖性的最优性，并揭示了自由探索原则的局限性。

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

Motivation: 传统的基于偏好的视觉语言模型微调方法存在训练不稳定的问题，特别是当负样本包含无信息梯度时会破坏训练过程。

Method: 第一阶段：使用温和负样本进行监督微调，通过低权重平滑监督来正则化基础策略并抑制过度自信；第二阶段：应用DPO目标，其中负项通过基于模型对每个负样本的平均token对数概率计算的冷却权重进行缩放。

Conclusion: 在冷却偏好之前平滑学习动态是进行稳健VLM对齐的简单通用原则，冷却权重机制是性能提升的主要驱动力。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

Conclusion: 损失函数景观可能不像传统认为的那样充满局部最小值，精确曲率信息的失败揭示了非线性离散化的几何特性和驻点分布的新见解。

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

*Junsoo Oh,Wei Huang,Taiji Suzuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Mamba模型的上下文学习能力进行理论分析，证明其可以通过测试时特征学习高效提取相关方向，样本复杂度优于线性Transformer，与非线性Transformer相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba作为新兴的线性时间序列模型，虽然计算效率高且实证表现优异，但其底层机制的理论理解仍然有限，需要深入分析其上下文学习能力。

Method: 研究Mamba在低维非线性目标函数任务中的上下文学习，特别关注单索引模型y≈g*(⟨β,x⟩)，通过基于梯度的预训练实现测试时特征学习。

Result: 证明Mamba能够从上下文样本中直接提取相关方向β，其测试时样本复杂度优于线性Transformer，与非线性Transformer相当，接近信息理论最优速率。

Conclusion: 非线性门控机制是Mamba实现特征提取的关键驱动因素，使其能够同时达到计算效率和高性能。

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Conclusion: VAR基生成式分类器为研究这类方法提供了新视角，具有可解释性、抗遗忘等独特优势，是扩散模型的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出MEASURE框架解决睡眠分期中的领域泛化问题，通过多尺度最小充分表示学习减少领域相关信息，在SleepEDF-20和MASS数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习睡眠分期模型在未见受试者上泛化能力差，现有对比学习方法未能充分提取领域不变特征，需要减少领域相关信息同时保留关键时序和频谱特征。

Method: 提出MEASURE框架，通过多尺度最小充分表示学习，在多个特征层级减少领域相关信息，同时保留睡眠分期所需的必要时序和频谱特征。

Result: 在SleepEDF-20和MASS公开睡眠分期基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MEASURE框架能有效减少领域相关信息，同时保留睡眠分期所需的关键特征，在领域泛化方面表现优异。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our
code is available at : https://github.com/ku-milab/Measure

TL;DR: 提出基于奇异学习理论的分阶段数据归因框架，揭示神经网络训练过程中样本间影响力的动态变化，包括符号翻转和峰值等非单调变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TDA方法将样本间影响力视为静态，但神经网络学习过程包含不同阶段，影响力模式会动态变化。

Method: 基于奇异学习理论构建分阶段数据归因框架，在玩具模型中进行分析和实证验证，并在语言模型中大规模演示。

Result: 影响力确实会发生非单调变化，包括符号翻转和发育转变时的尖锐峰值，这些变化与模型语义层次学习的进程直接对应。

Conclusion: 神经网络学习过程中的影响力是动态变化的，分阶段归因框架能更好地揭示模型学习的内部机制和发育阶段。

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

TL;DR: GraphShaper是一个几何感知的图基础模型框架，通过多几何专业化解决现有方法在结构边界处的性能退化问题，在零样本设置下显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的图表示学习方法假设所有图结构都能在单一欧几里得空间中编码，但实际上树结构需要双曲几何，循环模式需要球面几何。在结构边界处，节点面临冲突的几何约束，导致性能显著下降。

Method: GraphShaper采用多几何专业化方法，使用针对不同几何空间的专家网络，动态计算融合权重，根据局部结构特征自适应地整合几何特性，在文本嵌入对齐前保持结构完整性。

Result: 在零样本设置下，GraphShaper在引文网络上实现9.47%的准确率提升，在社交网络上实现7.63%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 通过尊重图结构的内在几何多样性，GraphShaper框架能够有效解决结构边界处的性能退化问题，显著提升图表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出H4G框架，通过可学习的块对角缩放矩阵和Möbius矩阵乘法系统性地减少嵌入半径，解决现有方法在双曲空间中过度抽象的问题，在异配图和同配图上分别实现12.8%和8.4%的零样本性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本属性图方法在需要细粒度模式识别的任务上表现不佳，特别是在异配图上。通过实证和理论分析发现存在过度抽象问题：当前方法在过大的双曲半径上操作，将多尺度结构信息压缩为统一的高层抽象，导致关键局部模式的信息丢失。

Method: 提出H4G框架，使用可学习的块对角缩放矩阵和Möbius矩阵乘法系统性地减少嵌入半径，从而恢复对细粒度模式的访问，同时以最小计算开销保持全局感知能力。

Result: H4G在异配图上实现12.8%的零样本性能提升，在同配图上实现8.4%的提升，达到最先进的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 半径减少能够实现忠实的多尺度表示，推动零样本图学习的进步，证实了在双曲空间中保持细粒度结构细节对最优图学习的重要性。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度强化学习中动态稀疏训练策略的模块特定效益，提出了模块特定训练(MST)框架，在不修改算法的情况下显著提升RL算法的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习中，更大的模型往往由于优化病理（如可塑性损失）导致性能下降。现有动态训练策略存在三个关键局限：对所有模块应用统一策略、评估基础架构、缺乏不同动态方法的系统比较。

Method: 通过跨模块和架构的综合研究，分析动态稀疏训练策略的模块特定效益，并提炼出模块特定训练(MST)框架，包括稀疏到稀疏、密集到稀疏和稀疏到密集等不同动态方法。

Result: 研究发现动态稀疏训练策略提供模块特定效益，与架构改进形成互补。MST框架在多样化RL算法中展示了显著的可扩展性增益。

Conclusion: 模块特定训练框架能够进一步利用架构改进的效益，在不进行算法修改的情况下实现深度强化学习算法的可扩展性提升。

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chimera是一个统一模型，通过状态空间模型直接融入数据拓扑结构，无需领域特定的偏置，在语言、视觉和图数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法依赖自注意力机制，将数据视为无序集合，忽略了数据的邻域结构或图拓扑，需要设计任务特定的偏置（如位置嵌入）来融入拓扑结构，但这需要大量工作且可能引入副作用。

Method: 提出Chimera模型，将状态空间模型（不需要位置嵌入）推广到捕获任意图拓扑结构。对于有向无环图可实现线性时间递归，对于一般图通过数学松弛达到Transformer的二次复杂度。

Result: Chimera在GLUE上比BERT高出0.7分，在ImageNet-1k上比ViT高出2.6%，在Long Range Graph Benchmark上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: Chimera验证了数据拓扑是跨模态的强大归纳偏置，提供了一种无需领域特定启发式方法的统一建模框架。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

TL;DR: nuGPR是一个新的高斯过程回归框架，通过数值线性代数技术显著降低训练计算成本，包括使用预处理共轭梯度法、数据聚类识别协方差矩阵块对角结构、数值梯度优化超参数，并在GPU上并行化，相比现有最佳GPU实现减少2倍训练时间和12倍峰值内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高斯过程回归(GPR)训练计算成本高的问题，特别是大规模数据集下的时间和空间复杂度挑战。

Method: 1. 使用预处理共轭梯度法加速线性求解；2. 利用数据聚类识别协方差矩阵的块对角结构，构造非对角块的低秩近似；3. 采用数值梯度而非精确微分来优化超参数；4. 利用CUDA Toolkit在NVIDIA GPU上并行化训练。

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上，相比现有最佳GPU实现，nuGPR将总训练时间减少最多2倍，峰值内存消耗减少最多12倍。

Conclusion: nuGPR通过结合多种数值线性代数技术和GPU并行化，有效解决了GPR的高计算成本问题，为大规模GPR应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

TL;DR: 提出GRACE框架，通过自适应频谱专家和跨集分布校准技术解决图少样本学习中的局部结构异质性和分布差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图少样本学习方法存在两个主要问题：1）使用固定的图滤波器无法处理真实图中局部拓扑结构的异质性；2）假设支持集和查询集来自相同分布，但在少样本条件下支持集数据有限，无法充分捕捉查询集的复杂分布。

Method: GRACE框架整合了两个关键技术：自适应频谱专家（Adaptive spectrum experts）用于适应局部结构变化，以及跨集分布校准（Cross-set distribution calibration）技术来处理支持集和查询集之间的分布差异。

Result: 理论上，该方法通过适应局部结构变化和跨集分布校准来增强模型泛化能力。实证上，GRACE在各种实验设置下都持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: GRACE框架有效解决了图少样本学习中的关键挑战，在理论和实证上都表现出优越性能，为处理图数据中的局部结构异质性和分布差异问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对联邦学习的公平性攻击方法，恶意客户端通过增加公平性损失来传播偏见，同时保持全局准确性，使得攻击难以检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护数据隐私，但由于参与者对训练数据的独立性，容易受到投毒攻击。同时，不同数据分布或历史偏见会无意中传播偏见，因此需要研究恶意参与者如何故意传播偏见。

Method: 提出一种故意公平性攻击，恶意客户端在训练时增加公平性损失，通过求解公平性指标（如人口统计均等和均衡赔率）的优化问题来计算公平性损失。

Result: 实验结果表明，即使在只有一个恶意客户端的情况下，攻击也能将偏见增加高达90%，且攻击对最先进的拜占庭鲁棒和公平感知聚合方案都有效。

Conclusion: 该攻击具有隐蔽性且难以检测，因为它能在增加偏见的同时保持全局准确性，揭示了联邦学习系统在公平性方面的脆弱性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在生存数据集中进行预算学习的问题，其中包含右删失实例，学习者可以支付预算来获取删失实例的部分标签信息，从而改进模型性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习需要已标记数据集，但在生存数据中存在右删失实例，仅知道事件发生时间的下界。现实世界数据收集中，对删失患者的随访并不总能获得完整信息，信息获取程度取决于预算和数据性质。

Method: 将最先进的预算学习算法应用于生存数据，允许学习者支付预算来获取删失实例的部分标签信息（如从"3年，删失"变为"7.2年，未删失"或其他变体）。

Result: 该方法提供的边界和时间复杂度与标准主动学习方法BatchBALD渐近等价。在多个生存任务上的实证分析表明，该模型在多个基准测试中优于其他潜在方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为在生存数据中应用预算学习提供了理论和实验基础，展示了如何有效利用预算来获取部分标签信息以改进模型性能。

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在推理过程中会进行反思和自我验证，但最近研究发现LLM在思维链中检测错误的能力有限，因此反思如何带来实际改进尚不清楚。

Method: 提出了一个简约的推理框架，支持小型transformer进行基本的自验证反思，无需自然语言，确保分析清晰度并降低实验成本。

Result: 实验表明，仅有几百万参数的小型transformer在训练和反思执行中都能从自验证中受益，在整数乘法和数独任务中达到了显著的LLM级别性能。

Conclusion: 将生成式transformer与判别式验证相结合，本质上促进了思维链推理，无论规模大小和是否使用自然语言。

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

Method: 通过理论分析元重加权的训练轨迹，发现其包含对齐、过滤和后过滤三个阶段，并基于此提出了集成均值中心化、行偏移和标签符号调制的轻量级替代方法。

Result: 在合成和真实标签噪声基准测试中，该方法持续优于强大的重加权/选择基线方法。

Conclusion: 元重加权的训练动态可分为三个明确阶段，其机制依赖于训练信号与干净子集信号的相似性加权耦合；提出的轻量级替代方法避免了昂贵的双层优化，获得了更稳定的性能。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

Conclusion: DE3S框架通过精确识别形状子，有效解决了医疗早期时间序列分类中的准确性和早期性冲突，在保持高准确性的同时实现了早期预测。

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型采样速度慢与一步方法缺乏可解释性和精细控制之间的矛盾

Method: 基于Koopman算子理论构建分层架构，在潜在空间中使用全局线性算子控制动态，通过尺度特定Koopman子空间解耦多尺度生成过程

Result: 实现竞争性的一步生成性能，并通过谱分析提供生成过程解释和操作机制

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了扩散模型中快速采样与可解释性之间的差距，为可解释图像合成开辟了新途径

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-LLM在文本属性图上结合了图神经网络和大语言模型，但现有攻击方法分别针对结构拓扑和文本属性，缺乏统一的多维攻击框架。

Method: IMDGA通过三个紧密集成的模块，协调图结构和文本特征的多层次扰动，在保持可解释性的同时实现攻击效果。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上的实验表明，IMDGA在可解释性、攻击效果、隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了Graph-LLM中先前未被充分探索的语义维度漏洞，为提高其韧性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and
resources are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MoRA的分子感知低秩自适应方法，为每个输入分子图生成独特的低秩适配权重，动态注入冻结的大型语言模型中，实现实例特定的参数空间对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理分子图结构时存在两个主要局限：1）优化所有分子输入共享的参数空间，限制了模型捕捉实例特定结构特征的能力；2）为分子任务微调LLM会导致灾难性遗忘，削弱其通用推理能力。

Method: MoRA方法为每个输入分子图生成独特的低秩适配权重，这些权重动态注入冻结的LLM中，使模型能够根据每个分子输入的结构调整其推理，同时保留LLM的核心知识。

Result: 在关键分子任务上的实验表明，MoRA的实例特定动态适配优于静态适配基线，包括化学反应预测精确匹配相对提升14.1%，量子性质预测误差降低22%。

Conclusion: MoRA通过实例特定的动态适配方法，有效解决了分子图与LLM集成中的关键挑战，在保持LLM通用能力的同时显著提升了分子任务的性能。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在执行性学习中，数据分布会因部署的模型而改变（如用户策略性调整特征），这比传统监督学习更复杂。需要不仅优化当前数据，还要考虑模型可能引导分布变化。

Method: 通过高维岭回归分析正则化对执行性效应的影响，理论分析和实验验证结合，使用合成和真实数据集进行实证评估。

Result: 执行性效应在总体设置下恶化测试风险，但在过参数化机制中可能有益；最优正则化强度与执行性效应整体强度成比例。

Conclusion: 正则化能有效应对执行性效应，通过设置与执行性效应强度相关的正则化参数，可以在预期这种效应时优化模型性能。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively

Motivation: 现有LoRA重用方法依赖显式任务标签或额外训练，不适用于实际部署，且通常激活固定数量的完整LoRA模块，导致参数冗余或不足，影响性能。

Method: 提出HiLoRA框架，将LoRA分解为秩一组件(ROCs)，在序列级别自适应选择LoRA子集并确定ROC分配，在token级别进一步细化路由，仅激活最相关的ROCs。

Result: 在领域泛化任务中，HiLoRA相比最先进基线方法准确率提升高达55%，同时保持相当的推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: HiLoRA提供了一种无需训练的高效LoRA重用方法，通过分层路由机制显著提升了领域泛化性能，具有理论保证和实际部署价值。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Conclusion: 通过多智能体联合动作和集合预测损失，显著提升了自我改进方法的样本效率和协调能力，同时大幅加速了解决方案生成阶段。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

Conclusion: GFF-PIELM成功扩展了PIELM解决高频和变频PDE的能力，其初始化策略可能进一步启发其他物理信息机器学习框架的发展。

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

Conclusion: DeepSPI在保持理论保证的同时，在在线强化学习设置中实现了竞争性的性能。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water
management.

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

TL;DR: 提出基于TSP的令牌重排序策略和误差后处理，解决同态加密下LLM文本生成的挑战，提升生成质量并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户使用私密信息与LLM交互，需要安全加密通信。同态加密虽支持加密数据计算，但文本生成（特别是下一令牌预测）仍是实际应用的主要障碍。

Method: 采用基于旅行商问题(TSP)的令牌重排序策略，结合后处理步骤减少近似误差，防止生成崩溃并提高文本连贯性。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，该方法能防止生成崩溃，提高生成文本的连贯性，并在整个过程中保持数据隐私。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了实用且保护隐私的LLM推理的可行性，为加密交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对跨模态数据错误检测问题，在表格数据上评估了多种方法，发现Cleanlab和DataScope与AutoML框架结合时表现最佳，但现有方法在处理真实世界重尾数据时仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模组织中确保数据质量面临挑战，传统错误检测方法主要关注单一模态（如表），容易忽略电商、医疗等领域的跨模态错误，其中图像、表格和文本数据共存。

Method: 在四个数据集上对五种基线方法进行基准测试，包括Cleanlab（标签错误检测框架）和DataScope（数据估值方法），并与强大的AutoML框架结合使用。

Result: Cleanlab和DataScope与AutoML框架配对时表现最佳，获得了最高的F1分数。

Conclusion: 现有方法在处理真实世界的重尾数据时仍然有限，这推动了该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效预训练异构图神经网络，学习具有更好可迁移性的知识，解决了语义不匹配问题。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

Motivation: 传统晶体距离函数存在四个主要问题：无法量化化合物间相似程度、不能区分成分差异和结构差异、缺乏对原子坐标变化的Lipschitz连续性、以及独特性度量对生成样本排列不具不变性。

Method: 提出两种连续距离函数来评估生成晶体材料的独特性和新颖性，这些函数理论上克服了传统距离函数的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，这些新距离函数能够揭示传统距离函数遗漏的洞察，为评估和比较无机晶体的生成模型提供了更可靠的基础。

Conclusion: 连续距离函数为评估生成式AI模型在无机晶体材料发现中的表现提供了更准确和可靠的度量标准。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

TL;DR: 提出基于高斯过程的非参数动态定价方法，使用贝叶斯优化来学习未知需求函数，在无限和有限库存场景下都优于传统强化学习方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态定价方法通常假设需求函数具有特定参数形式，这在现实场景中可能不成立，限制了方法的适用性

Method: 使用高斯过程对需求函数进行非参数建模，基于贝叶斯优化开发定价算法，适用于无限和有限库存两种场景

Result: 实验表明，基于贝叶斯优化的方法在收入方面优于多种最先进的强化学习算法，需要更少假设且具有更强鲁棒性

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是复杂不确定环境中动态定价的强大实用工具

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文重新审视了平坦最小值与泛化性能的关系，指出尖锐性应被视为函数依赖属性而非泛化差的可靠指标。研究表明正则化会产生更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值反而能带来更好的泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估平坦最小值与泛化性能的关联，因为近期研究发现这种关联存在理论反例和实证例外，需要更深入地理解尖锐性在模型性能中的作用。

Method: 进行广泛的实证研究，从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务，比较不同正则化方法（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）下的损失景观几何特性。

Result: 正则化模型倾向于收敛到更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值在泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性方面表现更好；无正则化的基线模型虽然收敛到更平坦的最小值，但在所有安全指标上表现更差。

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦性单独决定解的几何特性，尖锐最小值可以反映更合适的归纳偏置（特别是在正则化下），需要对损失景观几何进行以函数为中心的重新评估。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

TL;DR: 提出了TCVBM框架，将桥匹配扩展到时间相关视频序列，通过显式建模序列间依赖关系来保持时间一致性，在视频帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型擅长从噪声到数据的生成，但在复杂分布间的转换任务中表现不佳。桥匹配模型虽然能解决数据分布间的转换问题，但尚未应用于时间相关数据序列，这在需要保持时间一致性的视频任务中是一个关键限制。

Method: TCVBM框架扩展了桥匹配方法，在扩散桥中显式建模序列间依赖关系，直接将时间相关性纳入采样过程。

Result: 在视频帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率三个任务中，TCVBM在多个量化指标上取得了优越性能，显示出更好的生成质量和重建保真度。

Conclusion: TCVBM成功将桥匹配扩展到时间相关视频序列，通过建模时间相关性显著提升了视频任务的性能，为视频生成和操作任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

TL;DR: 提出CrossAD框架，通过跨尺度关联和跨窗口建模进行时间序列异常检测，在多尺度建模中显式捕捉动态的跨尺度关联，并利用全局多尺度上下文克服固定窗口限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多尺度建模时往往独立处理各尺度信息或使用简单特征融合，忽略了异常发生时跨尺度关联的动态变化，且大多基于固定滑动窗口限制了上下文信息捕捉能力。

Method: 提出跨尺度重建方法，从粗粒度序列重建细粒度序列来显式捕捉跨尺度关联；设计查询库并整合全局多尺度上下文来突破固定窗口尺寸的限制。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上使用九种评估指标进行广泛实验，验证了CrossAD的有效性，展示了在异常检测任务上的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CrossAD框架通过有效建模跨尺度关联和利用全局多尺度上下文，显著提升了时间序列异常检测的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 提出PubSub-VFL，一种基于发布/订阅架构的垂直联邦学习新范式，通过分层异步机制解决训练延迟和资源利用率低的问题，在保持准确性的同时实现2-7倍训练加速和高达91.07%的资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字经济发展，组织间数据协作需求增长，但隐私问题使直接数据共享不可行。垂直联邦学习(VFL)虽然能实现安全协作学习，但其同步依赖设计导致训练延迟高，且参与方的资源和数据异构性进一步降低了计算效率。

Method: 利用发布/订阅架构的解耦能力和参数服务器架构的数据并行性，设计分层异步机制；基于参与方系统配置文件形式化优化问题，选择最优超参数同时保护隐私；进行理论分析证明稳定收敛性和与差分隐私等安全协议的兼容性。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛案例研究表明，与最先进基线相比，PubSub-VFL在不影响准确性的情况下将训练速度提高了2-7倍，计算资源利用率高达91.07%。

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL通过创新的发布/订阅架构有效解决了垂直联邦学习中的训练效率和资源利用率问题，为安全高效的协作学习提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

Motivation: 现有去噪生成模型存在长期被忽视但普遍的问题：预定义噪声水平与采样过程中间状态实际编码的噪声水平不匹配，这种噪声偏移导致次优生成质量。

Method: 提出噪声感知引导(NAG)方法，明确引导采样轨迹保持与预定义噪声调度的一致性；并引入无分类器变体，通过噪声条件丢弃联合训练噪声条件和非条件模型。

Result: 在ImageNet生成和各种监督微调任务上的广泛实验表明，NAG能持续缓解噪声偏移，显著提升主流扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: 噪声偏移是扩散模型中的普遍问题，NAG提供了一种简单有效的校正方法，能显著改善生成性能。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing popularity of portable ECG systems and the growing demand for
privacy-compliant, energy-efficient real-time analysis require new approaches

aims to develop an innovative machine learning solution for analysing long-term
electrocardiograms that synergistically combines the strengths of edge and

are analysed with regard to their applicability in the project. The selection
of suitable methods in the edge area is based in particular on criteria such as
energy efficiency, processing capability and real-time capability.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

Conclusion: 通过解耦变量发现和动力学拟合问题，利用FIMs可以实现稳定、高效的粗粒化表示学习，为快速可重用的粗粒化流程提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出了元主动特征获取（meta-AFA）问题和Learning-to-Measure（L2M）方法，通过跨任务学习特征获取策略，无需针对每个任务重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动特征获取方法通常针对单一预定任务，缺乏可扩展性。现实数据中存在系统性缺失特征和有限标签的问题。

Method: L2M包含可靠的未见任务不确定性量化和基于不确定性的贪婪特征获取代理，使用序列建模或自回归预训练方法处理任意缺失模式。

Result: 在合成和真实表格基准测试中，L2M达到或超过任务特定基线，特别是在标签稀缺和高缺失率情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: L2M能够直接在具有回顾性缺失的数据集上操作，实现跨任务的元主动特征获取，无需针对每个任务重新训练。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

TL;DR: Laminar是一个用于大规模语言模型强化学习后训练的系统，通过完全解耦的架构解决了现有RL框架因轨迹生成延迟高度偏斜导致的GPU利用率低问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL框架在扩展到大规模集群时，由于RL轨迹生成的极端长尾偏斜性导致严重的GPU利用率不足，而现有的异步RL系统依赖全局权重同步，无法适应RL训练中高度偏斜且不断演化的轨迹生成延迟分布。

Method: 提出完全解耦的架构：1）用中继工作器层替代全局更新，实现异步细粒度权重同步；2）动态重打包机制将长尾轨迹整合到专用rollout上；3）完全解耦设计隔离故障确保鲁棒性。

Result: 在1024-GPU集群上的评估显示，Laminar相比最先进系统实现了最高5.48倍的训练吞吐量加速，同时减少了模型收敛时间。

Conclusion: Laminar通过轨迹级异步和完全解耦架构，有效解决了大规模RL后训练中的可扩展性问题，显著提升了训练效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Bellman Wasserstein距离（BWD），一种无需训练智能体即可评估离线强化学习数据集质量的指标，并展示了其在数据集筛选和策略优化中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习的数据集质量差异很大，但事先难以评估。现有方法需要训练智能体才能判断数据集质量，这在实际应用中效率低下。

Method: 提出了Bellman Wasserstein距离（BWD），这是一种基于价值感知的最优传输评分，通过行为评论家和状态条件最优传输公式计算，无需环境交互或完整策略优化。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务中，BWD与多个离线RL算法的性能得分强相关，能有效预测标准智能体在给定数据集上的表现。将BWD作为正则化器还能提升策略优化的回报。

Conclusion: 像BWD这样的价值感知分布信号是筛选离线RL数据集和优化策略的实用工具。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

Conclusion: 这种方法使复杂的事件分析更加易于获取，并加速了科学发现的步伐。

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe dynamical systems evolving
deterministically in continuous time. Accurate data-driven modeling of systems
as ODEs, a central problem across the natural sciences, remains challenging,
especially if the data is sparse or noisy. We introduce FIM-ODE (Foundation
Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs
zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on
synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SG-XDEAT是一个用于表格数据监督学习的新框架，通过双流编码器将特征分解为原始值流和目标条件流，结合跨维度注意力、跨编码注意力和自适应稀疏注意力机制来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格数据学习方法在处理特征间复杂依赖关系和噪声时存在局限，需要一种能同时建模原始特征和目标感知特征、并能自适应过滤噪声的鲁棒方法。

Method: 采用双流编码器分解特征，结合跨维度自注意力（捕获流内特征依赖）、跨编码自注意力（双向交互原始和目标感知表示）和自适应稀疏自注意力（动态抑制低效用标记）。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中均表现出优于强基线的稳定性能提升。

Conclusion: 联合建模原始特征和目标感知特征，同时自适应过滤噪声，能够构建更鲁棒的深度表格学习器。

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained

Whisper which address the above problem. Structured sparsity is enforced via
the Sparse Group LASSO penalty as a loss regularizer, to reduce the number of
FLOating Point operations (FLOPs). Further, a weight statistics aware pruning
algorithm is proposed. We also design our custom text normalizer for WER
evaluation. On Common Voice 11.0 Hindi dataset, we obtain, without degrading
WER, (a) 35.4% reduction in model parameters, 14.25% lower memory consumption
and 18.5% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-small, and (b) 31% reduction in model
parameters, 15.29% lower memory consumption and 16.95% fewer FLOPs on

Iterative Magnitude Pruning based method by pruning 18.7% more parameters along

Motivation: 混合思维LLM在效率和推理能力之间提供平衡，但实验发现当前系统存在思维模式分离不彻底的问题，推理行为会泄露到无思维模式中。

Method: 分析影响可控性的关键因素，提出基于四种关键因素的实用训练方法：更大数据规模、使用不同问题的思维和无思维答案、适度增加无思维数据量、采用两阶段训练策略。

Result: 相比标准训练，新方法在保持两种模式准确率的同时，显著减少无思维模式输出长度（从1085降至585）和推理支持性token出现次数（从5917降至522）。

Conclusion: 当前混合思维存在局限性，本文为增强其可控性提供了方向和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

Motivation: 传统谱聚类方法依赖特征向量计算，在大规模图上可扩展性受限。现有的稀疏化方法需要计算有效电阻，预处理成本高昂。本文研究是否简单的均匀边采样策略足以保持谱聚类所需的结构特性。

Method: 提出使用均匀边采样方法，采样O(γ²n log n/ε²)条边，其中γ是拉普拉斯矩阵条件数。通过引入新的簇内边电阻界、秩(n-k)有效电阻公式，以及针对主导特征空间的矩阵Chernoff界，完全绕过了重要性采样。

Result: 证明在具有大结构比Υ(k)=λ_{k+1}/ρ_G(k)的图上，均匀采样能够保持用于聚类的谱子空间。稀疏化图的顶部(n-k)维特征空间近似正交于聚类指示器，确保谱嵌入的忠实性和聚类质量。

Conclusion: 在强聚类性条件下，即使是均匀采样也具有结构感知能力，这首次为均匀边采样在结构保持谱聚类中的有效性提供了理论保证，连接了基于核心集的聚类理论与谱稀疏化。

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)

diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于城际客车异常停靠检测的稀疏感知方法，通过自适应分段、局部时间指标引导调整和图神经网络，在稀疏GPS数据和有限标注情况下实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城际客车异常停靠检测对乘客安全和运营可靠性至关重要，但面临GPS轨迹稀疏和标注数据有限两大挑战，现有方法假设密集采样或规则运动模式，适用性受限。

Method: 1) 稀疏感知分段(SAS)基于局部时空密度定义边界；2) 三个领域特定指标捕捉异常停靠行为；3) 局部时间指标引导调整(LTIGA)平滑指标；4) 构建时空图，应用标签传播和GCN学习关系模式；5) 自训练模块迭代改进预测。

Result: 在真实客车数据上的实验显示，仅使用10个标注实例就达到了0.854的AUC和0.866的AP，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据稀疏和标注稀缺问题，在城际客车异常停靠检测中表现出色，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

TL;DR: 该研究展示了在多任务微调中使用化学预训练图神经网络模型（如KERMT和KGPT）相比非预训练模型能显著提升药物发现端点预测性能，特别是在大数据量时效果最明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用自监督训练提取的通用化学知识来改进关键药物发现端点（包括靶点效力和ADMET性质）的预测性能，并探索多任务学习在化学预训练模型微调中的价值。

Method: 采用多任务微调方法，对化学预训练的图神经网络模型（KERMT和KGPT）进行优化，并与非预训练图神经网络模型进行比较。

Result: 多任务微调预训练模型显著优于非预训练模型，且KERMT模型在大数据量时性能提升最为显著。同时发布了两个多任务ADMET数据集分割以促进基准测试。

Conclusion: 多任务微调化学预训练模型是提升药物性质预测性能的有效策略，特别是在大数据场景下。研究提供了加速的KERMT实现和基准数据集，支持工业级药物发现工作流。

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARVQ是一种结合校正适配器和分组残差向量量化的后训练压缩方法，可将LLM嵌入层压缩至约1.6比特，显著减少内存占用并加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的嵌入层参数庞大，导致存储需求高和内存占用大，特别是在边缘设备上存在内存限制问题，需要压缩嵌入层来释放内存带宽并加速推理。

Method: 使用校正适配器结合分组残差向量量化，通过线性和非线性映射的组合来模拟原始模型嵌入，无需专用硬件支持低位存储。

Result: 在多个预训练LLM上测试，CARVQ在大多数情况下能实现更低的平均比特/参数，同时保持合理的困惑度和准确率，相比标量量化表现更好。

Conclusion: CARVQ提供了一种与最先进变换器量化方法兼容的压缩技术，可在支持4位内存的任何硬件上无缝集成，是实现LLM在边缘设备高效部署的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究决策树学习中的局部搜索操作（调整阈值或交换特征）对分类错误最小化的影响，发现这些问题通常是NP完全的，但通过参数化复杂度分析找到了固定参数可解的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策树学习算法通常包含启发式局部搜索操作，但缺乏对这些操作计算复杂度的系统分析。本文旨在理解这些问题的难解性和可解性条件。

Method: 采用参数化复杂度分析框架，考虑特征数量d和域大小D等参数，证明在d和D都较小时问题具有固定参数可解性，并开发了相应的算法。

Result: 发现当特征数量d和域大小D都较小时，问题可在(D+1)^(2d)·|I|^O(1)时间内求解，其中|I|是输入大小。提供了概念验证实现和实证结果。

Conclusion: 虽然决策树局部优化问题通常是NP完全的，但通过参数化复杂度分析揭示了特定条件下的可解性，为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出UNIVERSE方法，通过Rashomon集合处理变量重要性分析中的未观测变量问题，为真实变量重要性提供边界估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变量重要性分析依赖单一模型和观测特征，但变量重要性受其他变量影响，且观测数据常遗漏关键变量，同时Rashomon效应导致不同模型得出不同重要性

Method: 使用Rashomon集合（接近最优的模型集合），即使在缺失特征的情况下也能为真实变量重要性生成边界

Result: 理论证明方法鲁棒性，在半合成模拟中表现良好，在信用风险任务中展示实用性

Conclusion: UNIVERSE方法能有效处理变量重要性分析中的未观测变量问题和Rashomon效应，提供更可靠的变量重要性估计

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KoALA是一种无需语义信息、无需架构修改或对抗训练的轻量级对抗样本检测器，通过KL散度和L0相似度两种互补指标的分类预测一致性来检测对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对对抗攻击高度敏感，这对安全和关键应用构成重大风险。需要一种轻量级、即插即用的检测方案来保护现有模型。

Method: 使用KL散度（对密集低幅扰动敏感）和L0相似度（对稀疏高影响变化敏感）两种互补指标，当两种指标的分类预测不一致时判定为对抗样本。仅需在预训练图像编码器上用干净图像进行简单微调。

Result: 在ResNet/CIFAR-10上达到0.94精度和0.81召回率，在CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet上达到0.66精度和0.85召回率。当定理条件满足时，能持续有效检测对抗样本。

Conclusion: KoALA提供了一种轻量级、即插即用的对抗样本检测解决方案，适用于现有模型和多种数据模态，无需架构修改或对抗训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何构建概率预测以支持下游用户的准确决策，针对多决策者场景提出改进的omniprediction方法，证明multicalibration比omniprediction更难，并设计了更高效的确定性算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有omniprediction方法存在局限性：基于multicalibration的方法样本复杂度次优，基于对抗游戏的方法会产生复杂随机化预测器。需要设计更直接高效的确定性算法。

Method: 1) 证明multicalibration比omniprediction更难；2) 通过online-to-batch转换获得样本高效但复杂的随机化算法；3) 利用proper loss的结构特性设计更直接的确定性算法。

Result: 给出了multicalibration比omniprediction更难的严格下界，提出了改进的确定性算法，避免了复杂随机化预测器的问题。

Conclusion: 本文为多决策者场景下的概率预测提供了理论分析和改进算法，证明了现有方法的局限性并提出了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

Motivation: 评估AI代理在具有文化意义的不完全信息纸牌游戏Dhumbal中的表现，为文化游戏的数字保存和AI研究提供支持。

Method: 实现多种AI代理：基于规则的启发式方法（激进、保守、平衡、机会主义）、搜索方法（MCTS、ISMCTS）和强化学习方法（DQN、PPO），通过锦标赛进行评估。

Result: 在1024轮模拟中，基于规则的激进代理获得最高胜率（88.3%），显著优于ISMCTS（9.0%）和PPO（1.5%），主要通过有效利用Jhyap声明获胜。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个可复现的AI框架，展示了启发式方法在不完全信息下的有效性，支持文化游戏的数字保存和AI研究发展。

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,
thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural
games.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法存在严重的正向偏差问题，导致可靠性评分虚高，需要更准确的评估方法。

Method: 提出最优少数否决策略和基于回归的框架，直接建模验证器偏差，使用少量人工标注数据进行校正。

Result: 在366个高中Python程序的代码反馈任务中，回归方法将最大绝对误差降至1.2%，比14个最先进LLM的最佳集成性能提升2倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的回归框架能有效缓解LLM评估者的正向偏差，显著提高评估准确性。

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Motivation: AI智能体评估存在诸多挑战，影响对智能体真实性能的理解，需要更全面可靠的评估方法。

Method: 1. 标准化评估框架，在数百个虚拟机上进行并行评估；2. 三维分析覆盖模型、框架和基准；3. LLM辅助日志检查发现未报告行为。

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法手动解释基因变异耗时费力，需要自动化工具来加速从基础研究到临床应用的转化。现有基准测试过于狭窄，无法反映真实研究需求。

Method: 基于ClinGen专家整理的临床遗传学文献构建CGBench基准，测试模型在提取实验结果、评估证据强度、分类实验结果三个方面的能力。

Result: 测试了8种语言模型，发现模型在文献解释方面存在显著差距，推理模型在细粒度任务上表现更好，非推理模型在高层解释上更优。模型经常产生幻觉或误解结果。

Conclusion: CGBench揭示了语言模型在科学文献精确解释方面的优势和局限，为AI在临床遗传学和科学研究中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

Motivation: 在用户历史有限的情况下，个性化LLM响应的关键在于获取用户偏好，而生成跨领域的有效顺序澄清问题仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用受扩散模型启发的两阶段过程：前向过程从用户档案生成澄清问题并逐步移除答案作为"噪声"；反向过程训练模型通过提问来"去噪"用户档案。

Result: 该方法显著提高了LLM在提出漏斗式问题和有效获取用户偏好方面的能力。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段训练方法能有效提升LLM生成顺序澄清问题的能力，为个性化推荐系统提供了更好的用户偏好获取方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

Conclusion: CausalTrace成功地将神经符号因果分析集成到工业CoPilot中，提供了透明、可解释的决策支持，在高风险制造环境中表现出强大的性能和可靠性，有望提升工业AI系统的可信度和实用性。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live
deployment.

### [113] [Do Large Language Models Respect Contracts? Evaluating and Enforcing Contract-Adherence in Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12047)
*Soohan Lim,Joonghyuk Hahn,Hyunwoo Park,Sang-Ki Ko,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PACT是一个评估LLM生成代码契约遵守性的框架，扩展了HumanEval+和MBPP+基准，通过添加契约违反测试用例来系统评估代码的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准如HumanEval+和MBPP+主要评估功能正确性，但忽略了真实软件的关键方面——契约遵守性（处理异常输入的能力），这导致无法衡量模型生成的代码是否真正鲁棒可靠。

Method: 1) 构建专注于契约违反的测试套件语料库；2) 在不同提示条件下系统分析代码生成；3) 引入新指标来量化契约遵守性。发现添加契约违反测试用例比仅使用契约描述更能提升模型遵守契约的能力。

Result: PACT框架揭示了传统基准忽略的关键错误，提供了严格可解释的指标来评估LLM生成代码在功能和契约遵守性两方面的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PACT填补了现有代码生成评估的空白，首次系统性地评估和增强LLM生成代码的契约遵守性，为构建更可靠的AI代码生成系统提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

TL;DR: 提出地理感知层(GAL)框架，将LLM智能体与地理空间数据结合，提升灾害响应决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统计方法缺乏语义背景、跨事件泛化能力差且可解释性有限，LLM虽然具备少样本泛化能力但受限于文本且缺乏地理感知。

Method: 开发地理感知层(GAL)，从原始野火检测出发，自动检索并整合基础设施、人口、地形和天气等地理数据，生成带单位标注的感知脚本。

Result: 在真实野火场景中评估，地理感知智能体优于基线模型，能生成基于证据的资源分配建议。

Conclusion: 该框架可推广到洪水、飓风等其他灾害类型，为灾害响应提供地理感知的决策支持。

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

TL;DR: ThinkPilot是一个无需训练的框架，通过进化过程生成think-prefixes来优化大型推理模型的推理能力，显著提升效率、安全性和指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然强大，但存在推理效率低下和目标偏差问题，现有无需训练方法要么过于死板要么缺乏可操作性。

Method: 使用进化过程生成think-prefixes，这些前缀指令基于推理行为分类法演化，引导模型实现更优性能。

Result: ThinkPilot显著改善了准确率-长度权衡，大幅提升安全性（如将DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B的StrongREJECT分数从27.0%降至0.7），并增强指令遵循能力，还能与现有基于训练的方法协同工作。

Conclusion: think-prefixes能可靠控制大型推理模型的推理行为，不同任务对特定行为分布有强烈偏好，ThinkPilot提供了一个可泛化的框架来使模型推理与任务需求对齐。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

### [116] [AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066)
*Alessandro Achille,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于移动轨迹的人口统计推断方法严重依赖带标注的大规模轨迹数据，导致可解释性差且在不同数据集和用户群体间泛化能力弱。

Method: 将轨迹转换为语义丰富的自然语言表示，创建详细活动记录和多尺度访问摘要，然后使用分层思维链推理系统引导LLM完成事实特征提取、行为模式分析和人口统计推断三个认知阶段。

Result: 在真实世界轨迹数据上的实验评估表明，HiCoTraj在零样本场景下对多个人口统计属性实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: HiCoTraj解决了标注人口统计数据稀缺的挑战，同时提供了透明的推理链，在零样本场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM虽然具备通用决策能力，但仅基于语言训练缺乏物理环境暴露，限制了其真正的具身理解能力。

Method: 构建EmboMatrix训练场，包含多智能体数据引擎生成大规模任务场景、分布式异构硬件系统进行可扩展模拟、多级奖励架构提供精确监督。

Result: EmboBrain-7B在两个具身决策基准上比671B的DeepSeek-R1基线高出9.5%。

Conclusion: 交互式、环境基础的学习对于构建真正智能的具身智能体具有强大效果。

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测主要关注轨迹级分析，但在大规模数据集中检测个体相对于自身历史模式的异常行为仍具挑战性。

Method: 学习语义丰富的移动表示，整合位置意义和时间模式；采用行为聚类感知建模机制，构建个性化行为档案并通过跨周期行为比较识别异常。

Result: 能够检测个体移动行为中的细微偏差，识别行为转变和常规偏离，在大规模移动数据集中识别出异常个体。

Conclusion: BeSTAD通过直接从无标签数据学习个体行为，推动了异常检测向个性化和可解释移动分析的发展。

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

Motivation: 随着LLM技术的快速发展，许多应用需要随机性，但LLM处理随机性的能力尚不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，考虑外部工具访问、任务类型、模型状态和提示策略等因素，涵盖随机数生成、密码生成、项目洗牌等任务，并使用熵和NIST随机性测试套件评估质量。

Result: LLM能够生成具有一定随机性的输出，但性能不稳定，经常显著偏离预期行为。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明LLM在处理随机性任务方面存在关键局限性，需要改进才能有效处理涉及随机性的任务。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Conclusion: 该工作为自主构建未知复杂环境的程序化世界模型奠定了基础，展示了在苛刻约束下学习随机动态的能力。

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both

autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution

potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in

remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language
Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA
models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

TL;DR: ResearStudio是一个开源的实时可控深度研究代理框架，采用协作工作坊设计，支持用户在AI执行过程中随时暂停、编辑计划和代码，实现AI主导、人机协作和人类主导等多种工作模式的平滑切换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度研究代理运行在"发射后不管"模式，用户无法在执行过程中修正错误或添加专家知识，缺乏实时控制能力。

Method: 采用分层规划器-执行器架构，将每个步骤写入实时"计划即文档"，通过快速通信层将每个动作、文件变更和工具调用流式传输到Web界面。

Result: 在完全自主模式下，ResearStudio在GAIA基准测试中达到最先进水平，超越了OpenAI的DeepResearch和Manus等系统。

Conclusion: 强大的自动化性能和细粒度的人工控制可以共存，为安全可控的研究代理开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current deep-research agents run in a ''fire-and-forget'' mode: once started,
they give users no way to fix errors or add expert knowledge during execution.
We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time
human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design.
A hierarchical Planner-Executor writes every step to a live
''plan-as-document,'' a fast communication layer streams each action, file
change, and tool call to a web interface. At any moment, the user can pause the
run, edit the plan or code, run custom commands, and resume -- switching
smoothly between AI-led, human-assisted and human-led, AI-assisted modes. In
fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the
GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These
results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control
can coexist. The full code, protocol, and evaluation scripts are available at
https://github.com/ResearAI/ResearStudio. We will continue to update the
repository to encourage further work on safe and controllable research agents.

### [127] [On the Design and Evaluation of Human-centered Explainable AI Systems: A Systematic Review and Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12201)
*Aline Mangold,Juliane Zietz,Susanne Weinhold,Sebastian Pannasch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对65个评估可解释AI系统的用户研究进行了全面回顾，提出了以人为中心的XAI系统设计目标和评估指标，并根据用户AI专业水平（AI新手和数据专家）调整设计目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，对既高性能又可理解的智能系统需求增加。当前XAI系统的评估过于技术化，缺乏对用户需求的关注，需要进行以人为中心的评估研究。

Method: 对65个评估XAI系统的用户研究进行综合分析，提出XAI系统特性和以人为中心的评估指标分类，并根据用户AI专业水平扩展设计目标。

Result: 发现XAI系统由核心系统和解释组件构成；评估指标可分为情感、认知、可用性、可解释性和解释指标；针对AI新手和数据专家分别提出了不同的设计目标。

Conclusion: 提出了XAI评估和设计框架的扩展，强调需要根据用户特征定制XAI系统设计，AI新手关注负责任使用、接受度和可用性，数据专家关注性能导向的人机协作和任务表现。

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

### [128] [GOAT: A Training Framework for Goal-Oriented Agent with Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12218)
*Hyunji Min,Sangwon Jung,Junyoung Sung,Dosung Lee,Leekyeung Han,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GOAT是一个无需人工标注的训练框架，能够从API文档自动构建合成数据集，用于微调LLM代理处理目标导向的API执行任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在处理需要分解高级目标为多个相互依赖API调用的目标导向查询时能力有限，开源模型表现不佳，而闭源模型如GPT-4虽强但依赖零样本评估。

Method: 提出GOAT框架，从API文档自动生成合成数据集，训练LLM代理进行推理和生成连贯响应，支持相互依赖的API调用。

Result: GOAT训练的代理在多个现有目标导向基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在新基准GOATBench上也表现出色。

Conclusion: GOAT为构建能够进行复杂推理和工具使用的强大开源LLM代理提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

*Yuechun Yu,Han Ying,Haoan Jin,Wenjian Jiang,Dong Xian,Binghao Wang,Zhou Yang,Mengyue Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedKGEval是一个基于结构化医学知识的多轮对话评估框架，用于评估临床大语言模型在医生-患者交互中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要依赖事后回顾完整对话记录，忽略了医疗对话的动态性和上下文敏感性，无法捕捉真实临床环境中复杂的多轮医患互动。

Method: 使用知识图谱驱动的患者模拟机制，构建控制模块从知识图谱检索相关医学事实；采用原位逐轮评估框架，通过评判代理对每个模型响应进行临床适当性、事实准确性和安全性评估；建立多轮基准测试。

Result: 在八个最先进的大语言模型上进行了全面评估，证明MedKGEval能够识别传统评估流程经常忽略的细微行为缺陷和安全风险。

Conclusion: MedKGEval框架能够有效评估临床大语言模型在多轮医患对话中的表现，支持中英文医疗应用，并可扩展到其他语言。

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

*Jingyi Wang,Hongyuan Zhu,Ye Niu,Yunhui Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PromptFlow框架，通过模块化设计和元学习自动优化提示工程，减少人工干预并提高LLM在特定领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在特定领域部署时手动提示工程耗时耗力、缺乏动态策略选择和经验复用的问题。

Method: 提出PromptFlow模块化训练框架，集成元提示、操作符、优化器和评估器，采用基于梯度的元学习和强化学习来复用经验并自动探索最优提示优化路径。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了PromptFlow的有效性，能够以最少任务特定训练数据实现高性能。

Conclusion: PromptFlow为自动提示工程提供了系统化解决方案，显著提升了LLM在特定任务上的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

*Deyu Zou,Yongqiang Chen,Jianxiang Wang,Haochen Yang,Mufei Li,James Cheng,Pan Li,Yu Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了T³方法，通过检测信念偏差并截断训练轨迹，解决LLM在主动推理中的信念偏离问题，显著提升训练稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在主动推理中经常出现信念偏离问题，导致无法正确建模信念、丢失问题状态跟踪，陷入无信息或重复行动，进而影响强化学习训练效果。

Method: 开发T³方法，跟踪模型信念的偏离程度，检测过度的信念偏差，并在训练过程中截断轨迹以移除无信息的部分，保留信息性前缀的信用。

Result: 在5个挑战性任务中，T³持续提升训练稳定性、令牌效率和最终性能，实现高达30%的性能增益，同时减少约25%的滚动令牌。

Conclusion: 信念控制是开发稳健和可泛化LLM主动推理器的关键原则。

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

### [132] [Tensor Logic: The Language of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269)
*Pedro Domingos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出张量逻辑语言，统一神经和符号AI，通过张量方程实现逻辑规则与爱因斯坦求和的统一，支持推理、学习等AI核心功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI工具库如PyTorch缺乏自动推理和知识获取支持，而AI语言如LISP缺乏可扩展性和学习支持，需要统一解决方案。

Method: 基于张量方程构建张量逻辑语言，将逻辑规则和爱因斯坦求和视为相同操作，实现神经、符号和统计AI的统一表达。

Result: 优雅实现了transformer、形式推理、核机器和图模型等关键AI形式，支持嵌入空间中的可靠推理。

Conclusion: 张量逻辑结合了神经网络的可扩展性和符号推理的可靠性，为AI的广泛应用提供了潜在基础。

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

*Zirui Guo,Xubin Ren,Lingrui Xu,Jiahao Zhang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG-Anything是一个统一的多模态检索增强生成框架，能够跨文本、图像、表格和数学表达式等多种模态进行知识检索，解决了现有RAG系统仅支持文本的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统与真实世界信息环境存在严重不匹配。现实知识库本质上是多模态的，包含文本、视觉元素、结构化表格和数学表达式的丰富组合，但现有RAG框架仅限于文本内容，在处理多模态文档时存在根本性缺陷。

Method: 将多模态内容重新概念化为相互连接的知识实体而非孤立数据类型。引入双图构建来捕捉跨模态关系和文本语义的统一表示。开发了结合结构知识导航和语义匹配的跨模态混合检索方法。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试中表现出优越性能，相比最先进方法取得显著改进。在长文档处理方面性能提升尤为明显，传统方法在此类场景下表现不佳。

Conclusion: RAG-Anything建立了多模态知识访问的新范式，消除了当前系统的架构碎片化限制，为处理异构内容提供了有效的推理能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

TL;DR: LLM+CAS框架结合前沿大语言模型和计算机代数系统，通过符号反馈循环生成经过验证的创造性证明，特别适用于渐近不等式的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在数学研究中验证困难的问题，将AI工具从竞赛数学扩展到研究级数学工具，特别是针对Terence Tao提出的关于渐近不等式的证明问题。

Method: 使用LLM+CAS框架和O-Forge工具，通过上下文符号反馈循环将前沿LLM与计算机代数系统（如Mathematica）结合，LLM建议域分解，CAS提供公理化验证。

Result: 该框架在提出适当的域分解方面表现出显著效果，能够生成既具创造性又经过符号验证的证明，成功回答了Terence Tao提出的问题。

Conclusion: LLM+CAS框架展示了AI在从竞赛数学向专业数学家研究工具转变的潜力，特别是在渐近分析等需要复杂证明的领域。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文对基于大语言模型的Vibe Coding范式进行了首次系统性综述，建立了理论框架和实践模型，揭示了成功实施的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的发展，编程范式正从代码生成辅助转向自主编码代理，催生了"Vibe Coding"这一新兴开发方法。然而，这种范式的有效性尚未得到充分探索，实证研究显示存在生产力损失和人机协作挑战。

Method: 通过系统分析1000多篇研究论文，建立了Vibe Coding的理论基础（约束马尔可夫决策过程），并综合现有实践提出了五种开发模型：无约束自动化、迭代对话协作、规划驱动、测试驱动和上下文增强模型。

Result: 成功实施Vibe Coding不仅依赖于代理能力，更关键的是系统性的上下文工程、完善的开发环境和人机协作开发模型。研究提供了该领域的首个全面分类法。

Conclusion: Vibe Coding作为一种变革性开发方法，其成功实施需要综合考虑技术能力、系统环境和协作模式，为这一新兴领域奠定了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PricingLogic是首个评估大语言模型在旅游定价场景中可靠性的基准测试，包含300个基于真实定价政策的问题，测试模型在多规则重叠情况下的定价能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游机构希望将易出错的定价任务自动化给AI系统，但未经验证可靠性的LLM部署可能导致重大财务损失和客户信任危机。

Method: 构建包含300个自然语言问题的基准数据集，基于42个真实定价政策，分为两个难度层级：基础客户类型定价和涉及交互折扣的捆绑旅游计算。

Result: 对一系列LLM的评估显示，在较难层级上性能急剧下降，暴露出规则解释和算术推理方面的系统性失败。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM具备通用能力，但在收入关键型应用中仍不可靠，需要额外的安全保障或领域适应。

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MTOS框架，将多主题上下文与LLMs结合，通过短期和长期记忆、多种用户选择交互机制、动态主题选择策略以及信念衰减机制，模拟跨主题的观点演化。实验表明多主题设置显著改变极化趋势，LLM代理能更真实地模拟动态观点变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有研究主要关注单一主题，无法捕捉多主题、跨领域认知转移的问题，以及传统数值模型将复杂语言态度简化为离散值，缺乏可解释性、行为一致性和多主题整合能力的问题。

Method: 提出MTOS框架，整合多主题上下文与LLMs，利用短期和长期记忆，包含多种用户选择交互机制和动态主题选择策略，采用信念衰减机制实现跨主题观点更新。

Result: 多主题设置显著改变极化趋势：正相关主题放大回声室效应，负相关主题抑制回声室效应，不相关主题通过资源竞争也减轻回声室效应。与数值模型相比，LLM代理能更真实地模拟动态观点变化，再现新闻文本的语言特征，捕捉复杂的人类推理。

Conclusion: MTOS框架提高了模拟的可解释性和系统稳定性，能够更真实地模拟社交媒体中的观点演化过程，特别是在多主题交互的复杂环境中。

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

*Chengyang Dong,Nan Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习和偏置注意力机制的无信号交叉口自动驾驶决策框架，通过风险预测器评估碰撞风险并转化为密集奖励信号，提升安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无信号交叉口的自动驾驶决策面临复杂动态交互和高冲突风险的挑战，需要实现主动安全控制。

Method: 基于Soft Actor-Critic算法，使用偏置注意力机制构建交通风险预测器，将长期碰撞风险转化为密集奖励信号来指导决策。

Result: 仿真结果表明该方法有效提升了交叉口的交通效率和车辆安全性。

Conclusion: 该智能决策框架在复杂场景中具有有效性，证明了基于风险预测的强化学习方法在自动驾驶决策中的优势。

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is

*Jiaxin Gao,Chen Chen,Yanwen Jia,Xueluan Gong,Kwok-Yan Lam,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了LLM作为评估者时的判断偏见问题，发现了11种偏见类型，并提出了缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM被越来越多地用于自主评估通信系统中的内容质量，这些AI"法官"的公正性无法保证，其评估标准中的任何偏见都可能影响结果并削弱用户信任。

Method: 系统研究了两种LLM-as-a-judge模型（GPT-Judge和JudgeLM）在点式评分设置下的判断偏见，涵盖11种偏见类型，包括隐性和显性形式。

Result: 发现最先进的LLM法官对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，通常给它们分配比相应干净样本更低的分数；提供详细评分标准能进一步增强鲁棒性；在偏见响应上微调LLM会显著降低其性能；判断分数与任务难度相关。

Conclusion: 提出了四种潜在的缓解策略，以确保在实际通信场景中实现公平可靠的AI判断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发一个能够有效将医疗算法和指南转化为结构化对话的系统，支持临床工作流程，减少认知负担并提高效率。

Method: 采用有向无环图结构，集成问题转换管道、分层聚类的冷启动机制、扩展-剪枝的自适应分支、终止逻辑和自动化报告生成，基于人机交互原则设计患者和医生应用。

Result: 患者应用获得低认知负荷（NASA-TLX=15.6）、高可用性（SUS=86）和高满意度（QUIS=8.1/9）；医生应用获得中等认知负荷（NASA-TLX=26）、优秀可用性（SUS=88.5）和高满意度（8.3/9）。

Conclusion: 该框架成功集成到临床工作流程中，有效减少认知需求并支持高效报告生成，但存在系统延迟和小样本评估的局限性。

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能虚拟细胞(AIVCs)研究存在评估局限，如跨实验室和平台的可迁移性有限、数据分割易受泄漏和覆盖偏差影响、剂量/时间/组合效应未系统处理，以及跨尺度耦合受限。需要更系统的方法来学习可执行的、决策相关的细胞状态模型。

Method: 采用模型无关的细胞状态潜在(CSL)视角，通过操作符语法组织学习过程：测量、跨尺度耦合的提升/投影、以及用于剂量和调度的干预。强调功能空间读出，如通路活性、空间邻域和临床相关终点。

Result: 提出了决策对齐的评估蓝图，涵盖模态、尺度、上下文和干预的全面评估。推荐操作符感知的数据设计、抗泄漏分区和透明校准报告方法，以实现可重复的、同类比较。

Conclusion: CSL视角和操作符语法为AIVCs提供了系统化的学习框架，通过强调功能空间读出和决策对齐评估，能够促进可重复、可比较的研究，解决当前评估中的局限性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型的模型通常在粗粒度（句子或文档级别）操作，无法处理现实世界文本分类的多标签性质，需要能够提供细粒度洞察的可解释模型。

Method: 采用双阶段交替训练策略：无监督原型发现阶段学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，监督分类阶段将这些原型映射到类别标签。使用分层损失函数在子句、句子和文档级别强制一致性，并通过自适应原型和多头注意力捕获重叠和冲突语义。

Result: 在酒店评论基准数据集和两个公共基准测试（二分类和多分类）上的实验表明，ProtoSiTex实现了最先进的性能，同时提供忠实、人类对齐的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex为半可解释多标签文本分类提供了一个强大的解决方案，在保持高性能的同时提供细粒度的可解释性。

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

Motivation: 受自然选择中竞争与合作力量驱动智力演化的启发，旨在创建能产生更复杂社会动态和战略智能的多智能体系统，超越传统二元团队结构。

Method: 为每个智能体分配基因型，使用基于包容性适应度的奖励函数，基因材料可在智能体间共享，在囚徒困境网络游戏中研究社会动态。

Result: 结果符合汉密尔顿法则等生物学原理，能够产生从完全敌对到完全合作的光谱式合作关系，以及独特的非团队社会动态。

Conclusion: 基于包容性适应度的基因奖励结构为更高级战略智能和社会智能智能体的出现提供了基础，能够模拟生物进化式的多智能体自动课程学习。

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了HardcoreLogic基准测试，包含5000多个逻辑谜题，通过增加复杂性、引入非常规元素和不可解谜题三个维度来测试大型推理模型的鲁棒性，揭示了当前模型对记忆模式的依赖和真实推理能力的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注标准格式的流行谜题（如9x9数独），容易导致模型过拟合和记忆解模式，无法真正测试模型理解新规则和适应变体的能力。

Method: 构建HardcoreLogic基准，包含10种游戏的5000多个谜题，通过三个维度系统性地变换标准谜题：增加复杂性(IC)、引入非常规元素(UE)、包含不可解谜题(UP)。

Result: 评估显示各种大型推理模型性能显著下降，即使在其他基准测试中表现优异的模型也严重依赖记忆模式。增加复杂性是主要困难来源，但模型在细微规则变化上也表现不佳。

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic暴露了当前大型推理模型的局限性，为推进高级逻辑推理建立了新的基准测试标准。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在长视野智能体任务中面临内存限制，现有方法依赖与核心策略分离的外部启发式机制，无法实现端到端优化。

Method: 提出Memory-as-Action框架，将内存编辑操作作为统一策略的一部分；开发Dynamic Context Policy Optimization算法，通过在内存操作点分割轨迹来解决轨迹断裂问题。

Result: 端到端联合优化不仅减少了计算消耗，还提高了任务性能，通过自适应上下文管理策略适应模型内在能力。

Conclusion: 将内存管理作为可学习的内在能力，通过端到端强化学习联合优化任务推理和内存管理，能有效提升LLM在长视野任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

Motivation: 解决高性能具身AI系统依赖成本高昂的大型模型，而小型模型缺乏必要知识和技能的问题，弥合这一差距。

Method: 两阶段框架：1)具身先验学习，从轨迹增强先验、环境锚定先验和外部知识先验中提取知识；2)在线强化学习，引入自总结、密集奖励塑造和回合级策略优化。

Result: ERA-3B在高级规划(EB-ALFRED)和低级控制(EB-Manipulation)任务上均超越基于提示的大型模型和之前的训练基线，分别比GPT-4o提升8.4%和19.4%，并在未见任务上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: ERA为可扩展的具身智能提供了实用路径，为未来具身AI系统提供了方法论见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs作为法官的方法依赖简单聚合方法（如多数投票），即使个体智能体提供正确答案也可能失败，需要更有效的协作判断机制。

Method: 多智能体辩论法官框架，智能体协作推理并迭代优化响应；引入稳定性检测机制，通过时变Beta-Binomial混合模型建模法官共识动态，基于分布相似性（Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验）的自适应停止准则。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上的实验表明，该框架相比多数投票提高了判断准确性，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 辩论过程能够放大正确性，多智能体辩论框架为LLMs作为法官提供了更准确和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 自动驾驶面临安全挑战，传统传感器存在视野受限和被遮挡的问题。车辆间通信能够共享信息，即使在传感器被遮挡时也能保持对周围环境的感知。

Method: 设计并训练了基于协作感知消息的图神经网络（CAMNet），在一个广泛使用的运动预测数据集上进行训练，并在专门创建的CAM数据集上进行评估。

Result: 方法显示出有希望的结果，表明CAM数据确实可以支持车辆轨迹预测，但同时也存在一些局限性。

Conclusion: CAM数据在车辆轨迹预测方面具有潜力，但需要进一步研究来解决现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法成功提升了AI系统的鲁棒性，特别是在OOD检测方面，为安全关键应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and

the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

TL;DR: CTRL-Rec是一个允许用户通过自然语言实时控制推荐系统的方法，使用LLM模拟用户对推荐项目的判断，训练嵌入模型来近似这些判断，并将其集成到传统推荐系统的信号加权中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户对推荐系统不满意时，他们通常缺乏细粒度控制来改变推荐结果。LLM提供了通过自然语言请求来引导推荐的解决方案。

Method: 在训练时使用LLM模拟用户基于语言请求对项目的批准情况，训练嵌入模型来近似这些模拟判断，并将基于用户请求的预测集成到传统推荐系统的标准信号加权中。部署时每个用户请求仅需一次LLM嵌入计算。

Result: 在MovieLens数据集实验中，该方法在多样化请求上实现了细粒度控制。在19名Letterboxd用户的研究中，CTRL-Rec受到用户积极评价，与传统控制相比显著提升了用户的控制感和推荐满意度。

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec方法成功实现了通过自然语言实时控制推荐系统，显著提升了用户体验和控制感。

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.
