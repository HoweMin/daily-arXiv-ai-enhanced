### [1] [Sketch2BIM: A Multi-Agent Human-AI Collaborative Pipeline to Convert Hand-Drawn Floor Plans to 3D BIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20838)
*Abir Khan Ratul,Sanjay Acharjee,Somin Park,Md Nazmus Sakib*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种人机交互流程，将未缩放的徒手绘制的平面图草图转换为语义一致的3D BIM模型，利用多模态大语言模型在多智能体框架下实现感知提取、人工反馈、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使BIM创建对专家和非专家都更加便捷，仅使用徒手草图即可生成3D BIM模型，降低技术门槛。

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型驱动的多智能体推理框架，结合感知提取、人工反馈迭代、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成，将草图逐步转换为结构化JSON布局，再生成可执行脚本创建3D BIM模型。

Result: 在10个不同平面图上实验显示：门窗开口在初始阶段即被高可靠性捕捉，墙体检测从83%开始，经过几次反馈迭代后达到近乎完美对齐；所有类别的精确率、召回率和F1分数均保持在0.83以上，几何误差通过反馈修正逐步降低至零。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型驱动的多智能体推理能够使BIM创建对专家和非专家都更加便捷，仅使用徒手草图即可实现高质量的3D BIM模型生成。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

### [2] [Cultural Alien Sampler: Open-ended art generation balancing originality and coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20849)
*Alejandro H. Artiles,Hiromu Yakura,Levin Brinkmann,Mar Canet Sola,Hassan Abu Alhaija,Ignacio Serna,Nasim Rahaman,Bernhard Schölkopf,Iyad Rahwan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出文化异类采样器(CAS)，通过分离概念组合的连贯性和文化典型性，在保持内部一致性的同时生成偏离传统文化模式的新颖艺术概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大型语言模型在开放领域艺术创作中要么遵循熟悉的文化模式，要么在追求新颖性时牺牲连贯性的问题。

Method: 使用两个GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念在艺术品中的共现可能性，文化语境模型估计概念组合在艺术家作品中的典型程度。CAS选择高连贯性、低典型性的组合。

Result: 在人类评估中优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，与艺术学生表现相当；定量研究显示比GPT-4o产生更多样化的输出和更广的概念空间探索。

Conclusion: 人工文化异类性可以解锁自主代理的创造潜力，在保持连贯性的同时生成新颖的艺术概念。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

### [3] [Fuzzy numbers revisited: operations on extensional fuzzy numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20861)
*Krzysztof Siminski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模糊数表示方法——外延模糊数，以解决传统模糊数运算中的计算复杂性和结果特征不一致问题，并提供了相应的运算和关系运算符实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模糊数运算存在三个主要问题：(1)计算复杂度高；(2)某些运算结果不保持原始模糊集特征；(3)模糊扩散问题。这些问题限制了模糊数的应用范围。

Method: 采用外延模糊数作为新的表示方法，定义了外延模糊数的运算操作（加、减、乘、除等）和关系运算符（=、>、>=、<、<=），并通过C++实现。

Result: 提出的方法通过几个应用示例进行了验证，表明外延模糊数能够有效解决传统模糊数运算中的问题。

Conclusion: 外延模糊数为模糊数运算提供了一种更高效和一致的解决方案，扩展了模糊数的应用潜力，相关代码已在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

### [4] [Customizing Open Source LLMs for Quantitative Medication Attribute Extraction across Heterogeneous EHR Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21027)
*Zhe Fei,Mehmet Yigit Turali,Shreyas Rajesh,Xinyang Dai,Huyen Pham,Pavan Holur,Yuhui Zhu,Larissa Mooney,Yih-Ing Hser,Vwani Roychowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个基于开源大语言模型的框架，用于从异构电子健康记录中提取统一的阿片类药物使用障碍处方属性，并计算标准化的药物覆盖天数指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录系统中药物数据标准化的问题，特别是在监测阿片类药物使用障碍治疗药物时，关键处方属性分散在不同格式的字段和自由文本中。

Method: 定制开源大语言模型（Llama、Qwen、Gemma、MedGemma）来提取处方属性，采用固定JSON模式处理记录，并进行轻量级标准化和跨字段一致性检查。

Result: 在五个诊所的25,605条记录上评估，Qwen2.5-32B达到93.4%覆盖率和93.0%精确匹配准确率，MedGemma-27B达到93.1%/92.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了脆弱的站点特定ETL流程，支持本地隐私保护部署，能够在真实环境中实现跨站点的MOUD暴露、依从性和保留率的一致性分析。

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

### [5] [Epistemic Deference to AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21043)
*Benjamin Lange*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文探讨AI何时应优先于人类专家判断，提出了AI作为认知权威的概念，并批判了AI优先主义，主张采用全证据视角将AI输出作为贡献性理由而非完全替代人类认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是确定在什么情况下应该优先考虑AI输出而非人类专家判断，特别是在AI系统表现出可靠性和认知优势时。

Method: 作者基于社会认识论理论，提出了人工认知权威(AEA)概念，分析了AI优先主义的缺陷，并发展了全证据视角的AI服从理论。

Result: 研究结果表明，将AI输出作为贡献性理由而非完全替代人类认知具有三个关键优势：缓解专业知识萎缩、为有意义的人类监督提供认知依据、解释AI不可靠时的合理不信任。

Conclusion: 结论是AI服从应在高风险情境中基于严格的可靠性条件，采用全证据视角来确定何时优先考虑AI输出，这为AI与人类认知的合理结合提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

### [6] [From Questions to Queries: An AI-powered Multi-Agent Framework for Spatial Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21045)
*Ali Khosravi Kazazi,Zhenlong Li,M. Naser Lessani,Guido Cervone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体框架，用于将自然语言问题准确转换为空间SQL查询，通过知识库、语义增强和多智能体协作解决空间查询的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SQL的复杂性和PostGIS等工具中地理空间函数的专业性给非专家分析空间数据带来了显著障碍，现有单智能体方法难以处理空间查询的语义和句法复杂性。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包括知识库（程序化模式分析和语义增强）、上下文检索嵌入、协作多智能体管道（实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成）以及执行程序化和语义验证的审查智能体。

Result: 在KaggleDBQA基准测试中达到81.2%的总体准确率，在空间查询中达到87.7%的准确率（相比无审查智能体的76.7%），且在某些情况下生成的查询比基准测试中的查询更符合用户意图。

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更易访问，为空间Text-to-SQL系统提供了稳健、可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedAlign是一个解决医疗视觉问答中大型视觉语言模型幻觉问题的新框架，通过多模态直接偏好优化、检索感知专家混合架构和联邦治理机制，实现了视觉准确性和自适应推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型在医疗部署中的三个关键挑战：幻觉回答、固定深度推理效率低下和多机构协作困难。

Method: 提出多模态直接偏好优化(mDPO)目标，设计检索感知专家混合(RA-MoE)架构，以及联邦治理机制结合局部元认知不确定性估计器进行自适应推理。

Result: 在三个代表性Med-VQA数据集上达到最先进性能，F1分数比强检索增强基线提升高达11.85%，平均推理长度比固定深度CoT方法减少51.60%。

Conclusion: MedAlign框架有效解决了LVLM在医疗应用中的关键挑战，实现了视觉准确性和高效推理，为多机构医疗AI协作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种对观测数据中混杂偏差具有鲁棒性的深度强化学习算法，基于DQN构建，在存在未观测混杂因子的复杂高维环境中寻找最坏情况兼容环境下的安全策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在存在未观测混杂因子的复杂高维领域中，从有偏数据中进行离策略学习的问题，传统方法如Q学习在这种情况下可能失效。

Method: 基于深度Q网络(DQN)，提出了一种新颖的深度强化学习算法，旨在找到与观测兼容的最坏情况环境下的安全策略。

Result: 在12个存在混杂的Atari游戏上测试，发现在行为策略和目标策略输入不匹配且存在未观测混杂因子的所有游戏中，该方法始终优于标准DQN。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够有效处理观测数据中的混杂偏差，在存在未观测混杂因子的复杂环境中表现出比标准DQN更好的性能。

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文首次实证研究AI代理在去中心化治理中作为自主决策者的表现。通过分析3000多个主要协议提案，构建了一个能够解释提案背景、检索历史审议数据并独立决定投票立场的AI投票代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI代理在去中心化自治组织(DAO)治理中的决策能力，探索AI如何增强集体决策过程，为去中心化金融系统设计可解释且经济严谨的AI代理。

Method: 使用基于可验证区块链数据的现实金融模拟环境，通过模块化可组合程序(MCP)工作流实现数据流和工具使用，构建AI投票代理来分析提案背景和历史审议数据。

Result: 发现AI代理的决策与人类和代币加权结果高度一致，通过精心设计的评估指标显示出强对齐性。

Conclusion: 研究表明AI代理能够通过产生可解释、可审计且基于实证的信号来增强集体决策，为现实DAO治理环境提供支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

*Jihyun Lee,Yejin Min,San Kim,Yejin Jeon,SungJun Yang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PACE数据集和PACER咨询模型，用于恐慌发作场景下的心理急救支持，通过多维度评估框架PanicEval验证了模型的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恐慌发作是急性的恐惧和痛苦发作，及时适当的干预能显著帮助个体恢复稳定，但由于伦理和后勤问题，训练此类模型的合适数据集仍然稀缺。

Method: 引入PACE数据集（基于第一人称叙事构建的高痛苦发作数据，围绕心理急救原则结构化），训练PACER咨询模型（提供共情和指导性支持，通过监督学习和模拟偏好对齐优化），提出PanicEval多维度评估框架。

Result: 实验结果显示PACER在咨询师侧指标和客户情感改善方面均优于强基线模型。人工评估进一步证实其实用价值，在恐慌场景中持续优于通用、CBT基和GPT-4驱动的模型。

Conclusion: PACER模型在恐慌发作场景下能提供有效的心理急救支持，优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm
).

*Hanyu Zhu,Lance Fiondella,Jiawei Yuan,Kai Zeng,Long Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，实现RAG系统的大规模有效投毒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG投毒攻击主要关注检索内容或提示结构操作，忽视了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分考虑知识冲突问题。

Method: 首先识别与上下文投毒知识强相关的毒害响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过归因信号重用有潜力的知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上实验，持续实现超过90%的人口覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性，有效解决知识冲突。

Conclusion: NeuroGenPoisoning框架能够大规模生成有效的RAG投毒知识，通过神经元引导的投毒有效解决知识冲突问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

*Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt是一个自动化的提示优化框架，通过进化图优化方法设计更好的提示和推理过程，在领域特定任务中显著提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，为大型语言模型设计领域特定任务的最优提示和推理过程既必要又具挑战性，需要解决领域知识整合、推理效率提升和专家知识集成提示等关键问题。

Method: 提出EGO-Prompt框架，从专家构建的初始语义因果图出发，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程生成确定性推理指导，并采用迭代优化算法同时优化语义因果图和推理机制。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务中，EGO-Prompt比前沿方法F1分数提升7.32%-12.61%，使小模型以不到20%的成本达到大模型性能，并输出精炼的领域特定语义因果图。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt有效解决了领域特定提示设计挑战，显著提升LLM性能并降低成本，同时增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

### [13] [String Seed of Thought: Prompting LLMs for Distribution-Faithful and Diverse Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21150)
*Kou Misaki,Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出String Seed of Thought (SSoT)方法，通过让LLM先生成随机字符串来增加熵，然后从中提取随机性来选择答案，显著改善了概率指令跟随(PIF)性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要单一确定性答案的任务上表现出色，但在需要从预定义选项集中按特定概率分布选择答案的PIF任务上表现不佳，这影响了需要非确定性行为的应用(如人类行为模拟、内容多样化)和生成响应的多样性。

Method: SSoT提示方法：首先让LLM输出一个随机字符串生成足够熵，然后通过操作该字符串提取随机性来推导最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵守特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLMs的PIF性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能；在NoveltyBench上的实验表明SSoT还能增强开放任务的响应多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能够解决LLMs在概率指令跟随任务中的偏差问题，提升生成响应的多样性，适用于需要非确定性行为的各种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

*Yujin Jo,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NuSA-CL是一个轻量级、无内存的持续学习框架，通过低秩适配和零空间约束来保护预训练视觉语言模型的零样本能力，避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在现实部署中面临分布偏移和新任务挑战，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法来适应变化环境。

Method: 采用低秩适配技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已有知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效保护零样本迁移能力，在持续学习基准上取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL为现实应用中持续演化的零样本视觉语言模型提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

*Shuo Li,Keqin Xu,Jie Liu,Dan Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Shylock方法，用于在少样本和正常多变量时间序列中有效发现因果关系，通过组扩张卷积和共享核减少参数数量，结合全局和局部约束提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果关系发现方法存在依赖人工经验、统计方法或图形准则方法的问题，容易出错且依赖大量数据。在多变量时间序列中数据获取困难，现有方法容易过拟合。

Method: 使用组扩张卷积和共享核来指数级减少参数数量，同时学习具有时间延迟的变量表示；结合全局约束和局部约束实现网络间的信息共享。

Result: 在常用基准测试和生成数据集上的广泛实验表明，Shylock在少样本和正常多变量时间序列上都优于两种现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Shylock方法能够有效解决多变量时间序列因果关系发现问题，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下，并开发了Tcausal库便于使用。

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI自主系统能力的扩展，需要严格证明其安全性。OOD检测对于处理系统生命周期中的新颖和不确定情况至关重要，但当前缺乏系统的综述来指导安全工程实践。

Method: 采用系统性文献综述方法，首先定义相关概念，分析OOD成因和挑战因素，然后识别在整个ML开发生命周期中可用的OOD检测技术，并建议它们在安全保证论证中的适用位置。

Result: 识别了一系列可用于ML开发生命周期不同阶段的OOD检测技术，讨论了系统集成时的注意事项，为自主系统的安全开发提供了方法论指导。

Conclusion: OOD检测是确保自主系统安全的关键技术，需要在整个系统生命周期中系统性地应用，但仍面临诸多挑战，需要进一步研究来支持跨领域自主系统的安全开发和运行。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

*Robin Schmöcker,Christoph Schnell,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应选择UCT探索常数λ的策略，使算法对游戏奖励尺度不敏感，并推荐使用2σ作为λ值，其中σ是搜索树中所有状态-动作对Q值的经验标准差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度敏感，在具有密集奖励的游戏中，不同游戏的Q值范围差异很大，需要一种对奖励尺度不敏感的自适应λ选择策略。

Method: 评估了文献中提出的各种λ选择策略以及五种新策略，包括使用Q值的经验标准差作为λ的基础。

Result: 实验结果表明，新提出的λ=2σ策略在广泛任务中优于现有方法，无论是使用单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数时的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 推荐使用λ=2σ作为UCT的探索常数，其中σ是搜索树中所有状态-动作对Q值的经验标准差，这种方法对游戏奖励尺度不敏感且性能优越。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

TL;DR: 本文提出Chain-of-Guardrail(CoG)训练框架，通过重组或回溯不安全的推理步骤来解决大型推理模型的安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题。


<details>

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但存在严重的安全风险，包括有害内容生成和越狱攻击。现有缓解策略依赖注入启发式安全信号，往往会抑制推理能力，无法解决安全性与推理能力之间的权衡。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Guardrail(CoG)训练框架，通过重组或回溯不安全的推理步骤，引导模型回到安全轨迹，同时保留有效的推理链。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提高了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，显著优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架有效解决了大型推理模型的安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题，通过系统性地引导模型在推理过程中保持安全轨迹。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文对AIES和FAccT会议中关于可信AI的研究进行了范围综述，发现当前研究过于技术中心化，忽视了社会技术维度，提出了结合技术严谨性与社会文化考量的跨学科方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可信AI研究主要关注技术属性（可靠性、鲁棒性、公平性），而忽视了理解真实世界环境中AI可信度所需的社会技术维度，需要更全面的理解框架。

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文集进行范围综述，系统分析可信度的定义、操作化和应用方式，重点关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术、应用领域和基础价值观。

Result: 研究发现虽然技术属性定义取得进展，但存在关键差距：当前研究过度强调技术精度而牺牲社会伦理考量，社会技术性质探索不足，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的争议概念。

Conclusion: 需要结合技术严谨性与社会、文化、制度考量的跨学科方法，为AI伦理社区提出可操作措施，采用真正解决AI系统与社会复杂互动的整体框架。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合符号验证和交互验证的神经符号具身任务规划框架，通过在代码生成过程中主动与环境交互获取缺失观测，提升动态环境中的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代码即策略方法在动态或部分可观测环境中存在环境基础不足的问题，导致任务成功率较低。

Method: 在验证阶段生成探索性代码，主动与环境交互获取缺失观测，同时保持任务相关状态，结合符号验证和交互验证过程。

Result: 在RLBench和真实世界动态部分可观测场景中，任务成功率相比Code-as-Policies基线提升46.2%，任务相关动作可执行性达到86.8%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强生成代码的环境基础，显著提高了动态环境中任务规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有的CXR分析模型难以适应新的诊断任务和复杂推理场景，现有智能体依赖单一诊断流程且缺乏工具可靠性评估机制。

Method: 采用导演协调的三阶段方法：工具调用（通过证据驱动验证器验证输出）、诊断规划（组建专家团队）、协作决策（整合专家见解和上下文记忆）。

Result: 在各种CXR解释任务上表现出色，能提供视觉证据并良好泛化到不同复杂度的临床任务。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作和证据验证机制，显著提升了CXR诊断的适应性、可靠性和推理能力。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

TL;DR: Magellan是一个新颖框架，将创意生成重新定义为对LLM潜在概念空间的原则性引导探索，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索和分层引导系统来生成更具创新性的想法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在生成真正创新想法时的局限性，它们通常倾向于训练数据中的高概率熟悉概念，而现有方法如ToT依赖于无原则、不一致的自我评估启发式方法。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)和分层引导系统：语义罗盘向量进行长程方向引导，景观感知价值函数替代有缺陷的自我评估，平衡内在连贯性、外在新颖性和叙事进展。

Result: 广泛实验表明，Magellan在生成科学想法方面显著优于ReAct和ToT等强基线，具有更高的合理性和创新性。

Conclusion: 对于创造性发现，原则性引导搜索比无约束代理更有效，为LLM成为创新中更有能力的合作伙伴铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

TL;DR: 提出一个结合强化学习（RL）的框架，用于提高1.5B模型在数学推理中的性能，通过减少40%以上的token使用量来提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预算强制方法依赖监督微调（SFT）处理长上下文推理轨迹，导致小模型因冗长响应而性能下降，需要提高token效率。

Method: 整合强化学习（RL）到框架中，仅使用1.5K训练样本，优化token使用并提升数学推理性能。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，SFT+RL模型在不同计算预算下表现更好，准确率更高且token使用量减少40%以上。

Conclusion: 强化学习可以弥补长上下文训练带来的损失，整体提升数学推理性能，同时显著提高计算效率。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在关键领域表现出色但缺乏透明度，现有神经符号AI方法不适用于LLMs特性，需要系统性的符号集成方法。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究的路线图，为在LLMs中实施符号集成框架以增强透明度提供了实用见解。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

Method: 开发了三模块框架：M1使用深度学习进行数学表达式识别生成LaTeX代码；M2使用微调的小型LLM将LaTeX转换为PYOMO脚本；M3使用双层优化分解方法求解优化问题。

Result: MER模型在BLEU评分上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；BOBD方法在复杂测试问题上比内点法和遗传算法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt框架成功实现了从优化问题图像到自动求解的完整流程，在数学表达式识别和复杂优化问题求解方面都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and

*Yuxin Pan,Zhiguang Cao,Chengyang Gu,Liu Liu,Peilin Zhao,Yize Chen,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MoSES框架，通过状态可分解MDP和潜在空间扩展，让统一求解器能够感知VRP变体的共享组件特性并重用基础求解器，避免神经网络求解器数量指数增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多任务VRP神经网络方法通常学习统一求解器同时处理多个约束，但未能充分利用VRP变体的组合结构特性，错失了专业化基础求解器的潜在优势。

Method: 引入状态可分解MDP将VRP状态空间表示为基础VRP变体状态空间的笛卡尔积，开发潜在空间扩展结合最优基础策略和可学习混合函数，实现MoSES求解器通过专业化LoRA专家实现基础策略。

Result: 在多个VRP变体上的广泛实验表明MoSES优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过重用基础求解器有效提升了多任务VRP求解性能，同时避免了求解器数量的指数增长。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

*Ilija Lichkovski,Alexander Müller,Mariam Ibrahim,Tiwai Mhundwa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EU-Agent-Bench是一个评估LLM代理在欧盟法律框架下合规性的基准测试，通过人类策划的场景测试代理在可能引发非法行为的情况下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在各种场景中部署，它们可能表现出不可预测的行为，包括采取不良和/或不安全的行动。需要评估LLM代理在欧盟立法背景下采取非法行为的潜在倾向。

Method: 创建了一个可验证的人类策划基准，涵盖数据保护、偏见/歧视和科学诚信等多个类别场景。通过将模型的函数调用与详尽引用相关立法的评分标准进行比较来评估法律合规性。

Result: 评估了前沿LLM的法律合规性，并研究了在代理系统提示中提供相关立法摘录以及明确合规指令对合规性的影响。

Conclusion: 发布了公开预览集供研究社区使用，同时保留私有测试集以防止数据污染。鼓励未来工作将代理安全基准扩展到不同法律管辖区以及多轮和多语言交互。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

### [29] [Co-Sight: Enhancing LLM-Based Agents via Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21557)
*Hongwei Zhang,Ji Lu,Shiqing Jiang,Chenxiang Zhu,Li Xie,Chen Zhong,Haoran Chen,Yurui Zhu,Yongsheng Du,Yanqin Gao,Lingjun Huang,Baoli Wang,Fang Tan,Peng Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-Sight通过冲突感知元验证(CAMV)和可信推理结构化事实(TRSF)机制，将推理转化为可证伪和可审计的过程，解决了LLM智能体在长程推理中因中间推理验证不足而失败的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM智能体在长程推理中因中间推理验证不足而导致的失败问题，传统方法验证整个推理链效率低下且不可靠。

Method: 使用CAMV将验证重构为冲突识别和针对性证伪，仅在专家智能体间的分歧热点分配计算；TRSF通过结构化事实模块持续组织、验证和同步证据，确保推理基于一致且来源验证的信息。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%的准确率，Humanity's Last Exam上35.5%，Chinese-SimpleQA上93.8%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Co-Sight通过结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证的协同作用，为LLM智能体提供了可扩展的可靠长程推理范式。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

### [30] [Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Expert Demonstrations using Inverse Constraint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21560)
*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用模仿学习(ICL)训练神经控制屏障函数(CBF)的方法，该方法通过专家演示数据学习安全约束，避免了传统方法中需要明确指定失败状态集合的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域运行的自主系统中，安全是基本要求。传统基于优化的CBF合成方法计算成本高，且失败状态集合往往难以明确指定，而专家演示数据更容易获得。

Method: 使用模仿学习训练约束函数来分类系统状态为安全或非安全，然后用该函数标注模拟轨迹数据来训练神经CBF。

Result: 在四个不同环境中进行实证评估，该方法优于现有基线方法，且与使用真实安全标签训练的神经CBF性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习神经CBF提供了一种有效的替代方案，特别适用于失败状态难以明确指定的场景。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM)方法，通过估计自改进潜力指标CMP来指导代码代理的自我改进过程，在SWE-bench等基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自改进编码代理基于软件工程基准性能来选择自我修改，但作者发现代理的自改进潜力与其编码基准性能之间存在不匹配问题。

Method: 提出CMP指标来评估代理的自改进潜力，并基于此构建Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM)，通过估计CMP来指导自我修改树的搜索。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified和Polyglot基准测试中，HGM优于现有方法且使用更少的计算时间，优化后的代理在SWE-bench Lite上达到人类水平性能。

Conclusion: CMP指标能有效衡量自改进潜力，HGM方法在自改进编码代理开发中表现出色，并具有良好的迁移能力。

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

TL;DR: DeepAgent是一个端到端的深度推理智能体，通过自主思维、工具发现和动作执行在单一推理过程中完成任务，解决了长时交互中的上下文爆炸和错误累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体框架通常遵循预定义工作流程，限制了自主性和全局任务完成能力。现实世界任务需要外部工具和长时交互，但现有方法存在上下文长度爆炸和交互历史累积的问题。

Method: 提出自主内存折叠机制压缩过往交互为结构化记忆，开发端到端强化学习策略ToolPO，利用LLM模拟API并通过工具调用优势归因对工具调用token分配细粒度信用。

Result: 在8个基准测试中（包括通用工具使用任务和下游应用），DeepAgent在标记工具和开放集工具检索场景下均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作朝着为现实世界应用构建更通用和更强大的智能体迈出了一步。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

TL;DR: AstaBench是一个用于严格评估AI科学代理的基准套件，包含2400多个科学发现过程的问题，提供生产级搜索工具和标准化接口，解决了现有基准在全面性、可重复性和可控比较方面的不足。

Motivation: 现有AI代理基准存在多个缺陷：无法提供真实科学研究的全面衡量、缺乏可重复的代理工具、未考虑模型成本和工具访问等混杂变量、缺少标准化接口和全面基线代理。

Method: 定义了严格的基准原则和工具，开发AstaBench套件，包含2400+个涵盖整个科学发现过程和多领域的问题，配备生产级搜索工具的科学研究环境，以及9类科学优化代理和多个基线。

Result: 对57个代理在22个代理类别上的广泛评估显示，尽管在某些方面有进展，但AI在科学研究辅助方面仍远未达到解决挑战的水平。

Conclusion: 提出了更严格的AI代理基准原则和工具，开发了AstaBench套件来全面评估科学代理能力，评估结果表明AI在科学研究辅助方面仍有很大发展空间。

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需限制目标本体或实体的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面的知识图谱需要使用多个本体来将数据完全语境化到特定领域。简单的成对等价映射无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成。

Method: 采用检索增强生成方法选择相关类别来组成映射，并过滤匹配参考映射作为示例，增强上下文学习。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中，CMOMgen在类别选择方面优于基线方法，F1得分至少达到63%，在两个任务中优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够构建语义合理的映射，46%的非参考映射获得最高评分，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业公关活动存在言行不一的问题（如石油公司的"漂绿"现象），需要大规模理解框架及其变化来识别公关活动的真实目的。

Method: 构建专家标注的视频广告数据集，包含13种框架类型标注，专门用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态分析能力。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1在检测环境信息方面达到79% F1分数，但最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅达到46% F1分数。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源领域战略沟通的多模态分析研究，同时揭示了视觉语言模型在处理隐性框架、不同长度视频和隐性文化背景方面的挑战。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

Motivation: 解决自主代理在动态环境中协调时，高层任务目标与低层规划器输入之间的语义鸿沟问题。

Method: 采用双平面架构的知识图谱，将声明性事实编译为每个代理的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，将任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 在墨西哥湾的自主水下航行器案例研究中，可视化展示了端到端过程，并定量证明不同声明性策略能产生独特且高性能的结果。

Conclusion: 知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态编排器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

length of each link. We show that the shape of the chain can be obtained by
solving a convex optimization problem. Then we use optimality conditions to
show that the problem can be further reduced to solving a single non-linear
equation, when the links of the chain have symmetric mass and length.

Conclusion: 等黎曼几何优化能够克服学习流形映射中固有的扭曲问题，为在学习的低维流形上进行优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional data that exhibit an intrinsic low-dimensional structure are
ubiquitous in machine learning and data science. While various approaches allow
for learning the corresponding data manifold from finite samples, performing
downstream tasks such as optimization directly on these learned manifolds
presents a significant challenge. This work introduces a principled framework
for optimization on learned data manifolds using iso-Riemannian geometry. Our
approach addresses key limitations of classical Riemannian optimization in this
setting, specifically, that the Levi-Civita connection fails to yield
constant-speed geodesics, and that geodesic convexity assumptions break down
under the learned pullback constructions commonly used in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose new notions of monotonicity and Lipschitz
continuity tailored to the iso-Riemannian setting and propose iso-Riemannian
descent algorithms for which we provide a detailed convergence analysis. We
demonstrate the practical effectiveness of those algorithms on both synthetic
and real datasets, including MNIST under a learned pullback structure. Our
approach yields interpretable barycentres, improved clustering, and provably
efficient solutions to inverse problems, even in high-dimensional settings.
These results establish that optimization under iso-Riemannian geometry can
overcome distortions inherent to learned manifold mappings.

Abstract: Distributed energy resources offer a control-based option to improve
distribution system reliability by ensuring system states that positively
impact component failure rates. This option is an attractive complement to
otherwise costly and lengthy physical infrastructure upgrades. However,
required models that adequately map operational decisions and environmental
conditions to system failure risk are lacking because of data unavailability
and the fact that distribution system failures remain rare events. This paper
addresses this gap and proposes a multi-source data model that consistently
maps comprehensive weather and system state information to component failure
rates. To manage collinearity in the available features, we propose two
ensemble tree-based models that systematically identify the most influential
features and reduce the dataset's dimensionality based on each feature's impact
on failure rate estimates. These estimates are embedded within a sequential,
non-convex optimization procedure, that dynamically updates operational control
decisions. We perform a numerical experiment to demonstrate the cost and
reliability benefits that can be achieved through this reliability-aware
control approach and to analyze the properties of each proposed estimation
model.

Motivation: 研究当上层问题受限时双层线性规划的复杂度，填补现有研究空白。现有研究主要关注下层变量或约束固定时的可解性，但上层问题受限时的复杂度尚不明确。

Method: 通过理论证明和构造性方法，展示了即使上层问题极度简化（仅一个变量、无约束），双层线性规划决策问题仍保持NP完全性。同时提出了寻找局部最优解的多项式时间算法。

Result: 证明了双层线性规划决策问题在仅有一个上层变量、无上层约束且变量有界的情况下是NP完全的。但开发了找到局部最优解的多项式时间算法。

Conclusion: 仅限制上层问题的变量或约束数量不足以保证双层线性规划的可解性。然而，在实践中有可能找到局部最优解，且许多组合优化问题可建模为此类双层线性规划。

Abstract: Bilevel linear programming (LP) is one of the simplest classes of bilevel
optimization problems, yet it is known to be NP-hard in general. Specifically,
determining whether the optimal objective value of a bilevel LP is at least as
good as a given threshold, a standard decision version of the problem, is
NP-complete. However, this decision problem becomes tractable when either the
number of lower-level variables or the number of lower-level constraints is
fixed, which prompts the question: What if restrictions are placed on the
upper-level problem? In this paper, we address this gap by showing that the
decision version of bilevel LP remains NP-complete even when there is only a
single upper-level variable, no upper-level constraints (apart from the
constraint enforcing optimality of the lower-level decision) and all variables
are bounded between 0 and 1. This result implies that fixing the number of
variables or constraints in the upper-level problem alone does not lead to
tractability in general. On the positive side, we show that there is a
polynomial-time algorithm that finds a local optimal solution of such a
rational bilevel LP instance. We also demonstrate that many combinatorial
optimization problems, such as the knapsack problem and the traveling salesman
problem, can be written as such a bilevel LP instance.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with a linear-quadratic non-zero sum differential
game with asymmetric delayed information. To be specific, two players exist
time delays simultaneously which are different, leading the dynamical system
being an asymmetric information structure. By virtue of stochastic maximum
principle, the stochastic Hamiltonian system is given which is a delayed
forward-backward stochastic differential equation. Utilizing discretisation
approach and backward iteration technique, we establish the relationship
between forward and backward processes under asymmetric delayed information
structure and obtain the state-estimate feedback Nash equilibrium of our

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究McKean-Vlasov控制扩散的随机最优控制问题，旨在开发离散时间和有限粒子系统的近似方法，以解决连续时间问题和多智能体交互系统的控制难题。

Method: 采用松弛控制理论，在松弛策略空间上建立弱紧拓扑；证明成本函数在控制策略上的连续性；分析离散时间值函数向连续时间值函数的收敛性；扩展到N粒子交互系统，研究集中式和分散式均值场共享信息结构。

Result: 证明了最优松弛控制的存在性；离散时间值函数收敛到连续时间对应项；离散时间最优策略对原始连续时间问题是近似最优的；离散时间McKean-Vlasov策略在N→∞和时间步长趋于零时是渐近最优的。

Conclusion: 开发了通过离散时间McKean-Vlasov控制问题近似McKean-Vlasov最优控制问题的方法，证明了在集中式和分散式控制下，此类近似策略解对于N智能体交互模型是近似最优的。

Abstract: We study stochastic optimal control problems for (possibly degenerate)
McKean-Vlasov controlled diffusions and obtain discrete-time as well as finite
interacting particle approximations. (i) Under mild assumptions, we first prove
the existence of optimal relaxed controls by endowing the space of relaxed
policies with a compact weak topology. (ii) Establishing continuity of the cost
in control policy, we establish near-optimality of piecewise-constant strict
policies, show that the discrete-time value functions (finite-horizon and
discounted infinite-horizon) converge to their continuous-time counterparts as
the timestep converges to zero, and that optimal discrete-time policies are
near-optimal for the original continuous-time problem, where rates of
convergence are also obtained. (iii) We then extend these approximation and
near-optimality results to $N$-particle interacting systems under centralized
or decentralized mean-field sharing information structure, proving that the
discrete-time McKean-Vlasov policy is asymptotically optimal as $N\to \infty$
and the time step goes to zero. We thus develop an approximation of
McKean-Vlasov optimal control problems via discrete-time McKean-Vlasov control
problems (and associated numerical methods such as finite model approximation),
and also show the near optimality of such approximate policy solutions for the
$N$-agent interacting models under centralized and decentralized control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准贝叶斯优化算法在时变环境下难以保证无遗憾性能，需要寻找在时变条件下仍能保持有效优化的方法。

Method: 采用GP-UCB算法框架，通过不确定性注入处理历史观测，将问题重构为异方差高斯过程回归，并引入专家查询机制更新过时观测。

Result: 在具有挑战性的时变设置下，仅需每个时间步对数级别的额外查询即可获得无遗憾结果。

Conclusion: 最小量的额外信息足以抵消时间漂移，确保在时变环境下的高效优化。

Abstract: We study a time-varying Bayesian optimization problem with bandit feedback,
where the reward function belongs to a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).
We approach the problem via an upper-confidence bound Gaussian Process
algorithm, which has been proven to yield no-regret in the stationary case.
  The time-varying case is more challenging and no-regret results are out of
reach in general in the standard setting. As such, we instead tackle the
question of how many additional observations asked to an expert are required to
regain a no-regret property. To do so, we formulate the presence of past
observation via an uncertainty injection procedure, and we reframe the problem
as a heteroscedastic Gaussian Process regression. In addition, to achieve a
no-regret result, we discard long outdated observations and replace them with
updated (possibly very noisy) ones obtained by asking queries to an external
expert. By leveraging and extending sparse inference to the heteroscedastic
case, we are able to secure a no-regret result in a challenging time-varying
setting with only logarithmically-many side queries per time step. Our method
demonstrates that minimal additional information suffices to counteract
temporal drift, ensuring efficient optimization despite time variation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非凸非光滑双层优化问题，这类问题在机器学习中常见但传统方法难以处理

Method: Binno算法结合近端梯度更新和块对角凸组合，通过线搜索选择权重确保两个层级目标同时下降

Result: 在稀疏低秩分解任务中，Binno在合成矩阵和真实交通视频数据集上获得了更低的重构误差和更高的信噪比

Conclusion: Binno为处理非凸非光滑双层优化问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有理论保证和实际应用价值

Abstract: In this work, we develop a method for nonconvex, nonsmooth bi-level
optimization and we introduce Binno, a first order method that leverages
proximal constructions together with carefully designed descent conditions and
variational analysis. Within this framework, Binno provably enforces a descent
property for the overall objective surrogate associated with the bi-level
problem. Each iteration performs blockwise proximal-gradient updates for the
upper and the lower problems separately and then forms a calibrated,
block-diagonal convex combination of the two tentative iterates. A linesearch
selects the combination weights to enforce simultaneous descent of both
level-wise objectives, and we establish conditions guaranteeing the existence
of such weights together with descent directions induced by the associated
proximal-gradient maps. We also apply Binno in the context of sparse low-rank
factorization, where the upper level uses elementwise $\ell_1$ penalties and
the lower level uses nuclear norms, coupled via a Frobenius data term. We test
Binno on synthetic matrix and a real traffic-video dataset, attaining lower
relative reconstruction error and higher peak signal-to-noise ratio than some
standard methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究地理环境中环境资产管理的非合作决策问题，其中各地当局只关注自身福利最大化而不合作，但福利同时依赖于本地和全球环境资产，这导致了复杂的战略互动。

Method: 首先从N人博弈角度研究问题，找到显式的开环和闭环纳什均衡；然后研究N人博弈向均值场博弈的收敛；最后从社会规划者的合作角度解决问题，并与非合作均衡进行比较。

Result: 找到了N人博弈的开环和闭环纳什均衡的显式解，证明了当N趋于无穷时收敛到均值场博弈的唯一均衡；解决了社会规划者的问题，并找到了使分散闭环均衡与社会最优对齐的庇古税。

Conclusion: 该模型成功刻画了环境资产管理中的非合作决策问题，证明了纳什均衡的存在性和收敛性，并找到了实现社会最优的政策工具（庇古税），为环境政策制定提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to formulate and study a stochastic model for the
management of environmental assets in a geographical context where in each
place the local authorities take their policy decisions maximizing their own
welfare, hence not cooperating each other. A key feature of our model is that
the welfare depends not only on the local environmental asset, but also on the
global one, making the problem much more interesting but technically much more
complex to study, since strategic interaction among players arise.
  We study the problem first from the $N$-players game perspective and find
open and closed loop Nash equilibria in explicit form. We also study the
convergence of the $N$-players game (when $n\to +\infty$) to a suitable Mean
Field Game whose unique equilibrium is exactly the limit of both the open and
closed loop Nash equilibria found above, hence supporting their meaning for the
game. Then we solve explicitly the problem from the cooperative perspective of
the social planner and compare its solution to the equilibria of the
$N$-players game. Moreover we find the Pigouvian tax which aligns the
decentralized closed loop equilibrium to the social optimum.

Conclusion: 该框架成功将鲁棒遗憾控制问题转化为可解的μ-综合问题，为处理系统不确定性提供了有效的自适应控制方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a robust regret control framework in which the
performance baseline adapts to the realization of system uncertainty. The plant
is modeled as a discrete-time, uncertain linear time-invariant system with
real-parametric uncertainty. The performance baseline is the optimal non-causal
controller constructed with full knowledge of the disturbance and the specific
realization of the uncertain plant. We show that a controller achieves robust
additive regret relative to this baseline if and only if it satisfies a
related, robust $H_\infty$ performance condition on a modified plant. One
technical issue is that the modified plant can, in general, have a complicated
nonlinear dependence on the uncertainty. We use a linear approximation step so
that the robust additive regret condition can be recast as a standard
$\mu$-synthesis problem. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the
proposed approach.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一种无需Lipschitz约束的即插即用方法，在保持理论保证的同时提高了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-layer neural network architecture that gives a
promising neural network empowered optimization approach to the image
restoration problem. The proposed architecture is motivated by the recent study
of monotone Lipschitz-gradient (MoL-Grad) denoiser (Yukawa and Yamada, 2025)
which establishes an ``explainable'' plug-and-play (PnP) framework in the sense
of disclosing the objective minimized. The architecture is derived from the
gradient of a superposition of functions associated with each layer, having the
weights in the encoder and decoder tied with each other. Convexity of the
potential, and thus monotonicity of its gradient (denoiser), is ensured by
restricting ourselves to nonnegative weights. Unlike the previous PnP
approaches with theoretical guarantees, the denoiser is free from constraints
on the Lipschitz constant of the denoiser. Our PnP algorithm employing the
weight-tying nonnegative neural network converges to a minimizer of the
objective involving an ``implicit'' weakly convex regularizer induced by the
denoiser. The convergence analysis relies on an efficient technique to preserve
the overall convexity even in the ill-conditioned case where the loss function
is not strongly convex. The simulation study shows the advantages of the
Lipschitz-constraint-free nature of the proposed denoiser in training time as
well as deblurring performance.

Abstract: This work addresses the finite-time analysis of nonsmooth nonconvex
stochastic optimization under Riemannian manifold constraints. We adapt the
notion of Goldstein stationarity to the Riemannian setting as a performance
metric for nonsmooth optimization on manifolds. We then propose a Riemannian
Online to NonConvex (RO2NC) algorithm, for which we establish the sample
complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3}\delta^{-1})$ in finding
$(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points. This result is the first-ever
finite-time guarantee for fully nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization on manifolds
and matches the optimal complexity in the Euclidean setting. When gradient
information is unavailable, we develop a zeroth order version of RO2NC
algorithm (ZO-RO2NC), for which we establish the same sample complexity. The
numerical results support the theory and demonstrate the practical
effectiveness of the algorithms.

Conclusion: 该方法为网络系统中存在时变延迟的优化问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过切换控制框架保证了算法的收敛性能。

Abstract: Deployment of optimization algorithms on networked systems face challenges
associated with time delays and corruptions. One particular instance is the
presence of time-varying delays arising from factors such as packet drops and
irregular sampling. Fixed time delays can destabilize gradient descent
algorithms, and this degradation is exacerbated by time-varying delays. This
work concentrates on the analysis and creation of discrete-time optimization
algorithms with certified exponential convergence rates that are robust against
switched uncertainties between the optimizer and the gradient oracle. These
optimization algorithms are implemented by a switch-scheduled output feedback
controllers. Rate variation and sawtooth behavior (packet drops) in
time-varying delays can be imposed through constraining switching sequences.
Analysis is accomplished by bisection in the convergence rate to find
Zames-Falb filter coefficents. Synthesis is performed by alternating between a
filter coefficient search for a fixed controller, and a controller search for
fixed multipliers.

Abstract: Motivated by applications to the dynamic control of queueing networks, we
develop a simulation-based scheme, the so-called multilevel Picard (MLP)
approximation, for solving high-dimensional drift control problems whose states
are constrained to stay within the nonnegative orthant, over a finite time
horizon. We prove that under suitable conditions, the MLP approximation
overcomes the curse of dimensionality in the following sense: To approximate
the value function and its gradient evaluated at a given time and state to
within a prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$, the computational complexity grows
at most polynomially in the problem dimension $d$ and $1/\varepsilon$. To
illustrate the effectiveness of the scheme, we carry out numerical experiments
for a class of test problems that are related to the dynamic scheduling problem
of parallel server systems in heavy traffic, and demonstrate that the scheme is
computationally feasible up to dimension at least $20$.

Abstract: We present a performant gradient method for smooth convex optimization,
drawing inspiration from several recent advances in the field. Our algorithm,
the Adaptive Subgame Perfect Gradient Method (ASPGM) is based on the notion of
subgame perfection, attaining a dynamic strengthening of minimax optimality. At
each iteration, ASPGM makes a momentum-type update, optimized dynamically based
on a (limited) memory/bundle of past first-order information. ASPGM is
linesearch-free, parameter-free, and adaptive due to its use of recently
developed auto-conditioning, restarting, and preconditioning ideas. We show
that ASPGM is competitive with state-of-the-art L-BFGS methods on a wide range
of smooth convex problems. Unlike quasi-Newton methods, however, our core
algorithm underlying ASPGM has strong, subgame perfect, non-asymptotic
guarantees, providing certificates of solution quality, resulting in simple
stopping criteria and restarting conditions.

Result: 解决了测试时逆缩放问题，在MMAU Test-mini上大幅超越Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-4o Audio，在MMSU推理任务上接近人类水平，增强的推理能力同时改善了多模态推理和感知能力。

Conclusion: CESAR为开发音频大语言模型中稳健且可扩展的推理建立了原则性方法，将推理从劣势转变为优势。

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRISP是一个基于图时空学习的危机弹性投资框架，通过自适应图注意力机制发现资产间的重要关系，在危机期间保持盈利能力，相比基准方法显著提升夏普比率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融时间序列预测面临核心挑战：预测最优资产配置需要理解危机期间变化的关联结构。现有基于图的方法依赖预定义拓扑，无法适应不同危机机制下的市场动态变化。

Method: 使用图卷积网络编码空间关系，BiLSTM与自注意力机制处理时序动态，通过多头图注意力网络学习稀疏结构，自适应发现重要资产关系。

Result: 在2005-2021数据上训练，能够泛化到2022-2024通胀驱动市场，夏普比率达3.76，比等权重基准提升707%，比静态图方法提升94%。过滤92.5%连接为噪声，保留危机相关依赖。

Conclusion: CRISP通过自适应学习而非强加假设，实现了跨危机机制的稳健泛化，注意力权重提供可解释的机制检测，在危机期间防御性集群注意力增强49%。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

Conclusion: MOBO-OSD是一种有效的多目标贝叶斯优化算法，能够生成高质量且多样化的帕累托最优解集。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态学习范式“负学习”，通过主导模态动态引导弱模态抑制非目标类别，而不是强制对齐，以解决模态不平衡问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统多模态学习方法强制弱模态与主导模态对齐，这会抑制弱模态的独特信息。为了解决模态不平衡问题，需要一种能保留模态特定信息的新方法。

Method: 提出多模态负学习框架，主导模态动态指导弱模态抑制非目标类别，通过增加单模态置信度边界来稳定决策空间。

Conclusion: 负学习范式为多模态学习提供了新视角，能有效解决模态不平衡问题，同时保留各模态的独特信息，具有较好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: RAG虽然能提高LLM输出准确性，但引入外部知识库导致长上下文处理挑战，显著增加内存消耗和推理延迟。现有方法通过预计算KV缓存来加速推理，但仍有优化空间。

Method: 1. 基于KV块访问频率的热感知混合精度压缩加载方法，减少磁盘I/O和内存访问开销；2. 热感知数据放置策略，优先将高频访问KV块存储在高速内存中。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Method: 基于大偏差和亚稳态分析的技术工具，开发了重尾SGD全局动力学的尖锐表征方法，通过在训练阶段注入并截断重尾噪声来增强SGD避免尖锐极小值的能力。

Result: 理论和实验均证实，带有梯度裁剪的重尾SGD能够找到几何形状更平坦的局部极小值，并在测试数据上实现更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 重尾噪声注入和截断是提升SGD避免尖锐极小值能力、改善泛化性能的有效策略，为深度学习训练提供了新的理论指导。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，所提方法达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 提出的两种方法有效解决了区间目标回归问题，在放松先前假设条件的同时实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在固定输入/输出视野、无法建模不确定性方面的架构限制，整合结构化时序数据和非结构化文本信息进行更准确的预测。

Method: LBS包含两个组件：状态空间模型(SSM)捕捉潜在状态的时间动态，预训练大语言模型(LLM)编码文本输入进行后验状态估计，并解码与潜在轨迹一致的文本预测。

Result: 在TextTimeCorpus基准测试中，LBS将之前的最先进方法提升了13.20%，同时为每个预测提供人类可读的摘要。

Conclusion: 这是首个将LLM和SSM统一用于联合数值和文本预测的工作，为多模态时序推理提供了新颖基础。

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无模型强化学习方法缺乏正式的安全保证，现有方法通常需要详细的安全规范知识。许多难以明确规范的安全问题最好通过不变性来表征。

Method: 使用模型预测路径积分控制来检查学习策略提出的动作在整个训练过程中的安全性，该方法仅需查询黑盒动力学，无需明确了解动力学或安全约束。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的算法在所有不安全动作之前成功中止，同时实现了与允许违反安全性的基线PPO方法相当的训练进度。

Conclusion: 基于可逆性的方法能够有效防止强化学习训练过程中的安全问题，仅需查询黑盒动力学即可实现安全保证。

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型自我诊断在复杂任务上不可靠，而传统的多智能体辩论协议将辩论视为零和游戏，导致智能体为了赢得辩论而误导法官，出现"辩论黑客"问题，反而引入更多错误。

Method: 提出协作式多智能体辩论协议ColMAD，鼓励多个智能体以支持性的方式相互批评，互相补充缺失的观点，使法官智能体能够基于更全面的证据做出更明智的结论。

Result: 实验表明，ColMAD在错误检测任务上显著优于之前的竞争性多智能体辩论方法19%，并且相比单智能体方法带来了非平凡的改进。

Conclusion: 将多智能体辩论重新定义为非零和游戏能够有效缓解辩论黑客问题，通过协作式批评显著提升错误检测性能，为大语言模型的可扩展监督提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

Method: 研究了多种缓解频谱偏差的策略，包括专用激活函数、固定和可训练位置编码、非线性核的线性组合，并在胸主动脉的血流动力学场和48个胸主动脉解剖结构上进行测试。

Result: INRs实现了约230的压缩比，压力最大绝对误差1 mmHg，速度误差5-10 cm/s，解剖平均误差低于0.5 mm，最大误差1.6 mm。SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE架构表现最佳。

Conclusion: INRs在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示方面具有高效率和准确性，为医学图像和模拟数据提供了有前景的表示方法。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

TL;DR: L2M3OF是首个用于金属有机框架(MOFs)的多模态大语言模型，通过整合晶体结构表示学习与语言理解，在材料特性预测和知识生成任务中超越了仅基于文本的闭源LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但在科学发现领域突破有限，因为理解复杂物理现象需要超越语言的多模态表示。MOFs材料设计尤其具有挑战性，其三维原子排列和配位几何规则难以用纯语言表示。

Method: L2M3OF整合了结构、文本和知识模态，使用预训练的晶体编码器和轻量级投影层将结构信息压缩到标记空间，实现与语言指令的高效对齐。构建了结构-属性-知识数据库进行训练和评估。

Result: 实验表明，L2M3OF在特性预测和知识生成任务中超越了GPT-5、Gemini-2.5-Pro和DeepSeek-R1等最先进的闭源LLMs，且使用的参数数量更少。

Conclusion: 多模态方法对于多孔材料理解至关重要，L2M3OF为下一代材料发现AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备端神经网络训练面临严重的内存限制，限制了预训练模型在下游任务上的适配能力。

Method: 引入LaRa（层排序）改进的层重要性度量进行层预选，以及利用通道重要性分布时间稳定性的动态通道采样策略，在训练周期间按重要性加权概率重新采样通道。

Result: 在大量任务和架构上的评估显示，MeDyate在极端内存约束下达到最先进性能，优于现有静态和动态方法，内存预算可低至几百kB RAM。

Conclusion: 该方法通过证明在极低内存预算下的有效微调，为实现高效设备端学习迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分组格点向量量化(GL-VQ)框架，通过为每组权重分配定制化的格点码本来改进LLM的后训练量化，在低比特场景下实现更好的模型大小与精度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理需要大量计算资源和内存，标准均匀量化在低比特场景下会导致显著性能下降，需要更有效的量化方法来部署大模型。

Method: 使用分组格点向量量化，为每组权重分配可学习生成矩阵定义的格点码本，采用Babai舍入近似最近格点搜索来解决量化过程的不可微问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，相比现有后训练量化基线方法，该方法在模型大小和精度之间实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: GLVQ框架为在严格资源约束下部署大模型提供了一种高效实用的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Motivation: 理解深度网络成功背后的神秘现象，特别是神经崩溃现象，现有理论研究主要将最后一层特征视为无约束优化变量，忽略了数据结构和非线性激活的影响。

Method: 使用梯度流方法分析在正交可分数据上训练的两层ReLU网络，研究其训练动态和隐式偏置。

Result: 证明了两层ReLU网络在正交可分数据上通过梯度流训练会展现出神经崩溃现象。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了对神经崩溃现象的理论理解，揭示了数据结构和训练动态中的隐式偏置在NC形成中的重要作用。

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression
setting.

effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练脉冲神经网络(SNN)进行多元时间序列二分类的通用框架，重点实现逐步预测和在低误报率下的高精度。该框架使用EONS算法联合优化SNN架构和参数，并通过集成方法提升性能。


<details>

Motivation: 开发一个通用框架来训练SNN处理多元时间序列分类问题，特别关注在低误报率下实现高精度的逐步预测，同时保持网络稀疏性和低功耗特性。

Method: 使用EONS算法进化稀疏、有状态的SNN，联合优化网络架构和参数；将输入编码为脉冲序列；通过阈值化单个输出神经元的脉冲计数进行预测；采用简单投票集成方法提升性能和鲁棒性。

Result: 在放射性源检测任务中，仅49个神经元和66个突触的SNN在1/小时误报率下达到51.8%真阳性率，优于PCA(42.7%)和深度学习(49.8%)基线；三模型集成将真阳性率提升至67.1%。硬件部署显示功耗2mW，推理延迟20.2ms。在癫痫检测任务中，集成方法达到95%真阳性率和16%假阳性率，与深度学习相当但参数显著减少。

Conclusion: 该框架能够训练出高效、低功耗的SNN，在多元时间序列分类任务中表现出色，特别是在低误报率要求下优于传统方法，且具有良好的通用性和硬件部署优势。

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像自回归模型虽然性能优异，但采样步骤多导致生成速度慢。DD1方法虽然实现了少步采样，但在一步采样设置下性能下降明显，且依赖预定义映射限制了灵活性。

Method: 将原始AR模型视为教师模型，在潜在嵌入空间中提供每个token位置的条件分数真值。提出条件分数蒸馏损失来训练一步生成器，训练单独的网络预测生成分布的条件分数，并在每个token位置基于先前token进行分数蒸馏。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上，DD2实现了一步采样，FID从3.40增加到5.43。相比DD1基线，将一步采样与原始AR模型的差距减少了67%，同时实现了12.3倍的训练加速。

Conclusion: DD2在实现一步AR生成的目标上迈出了重要一步，为快速高质量的AR建模开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

Motivation: 探索零阶优化作为解决持续学习中可塑性-稳定性-效率三难问题的新方法，利用其内存效率优势。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究评估ZO优化在持续学习中的表现，并提出ZO-FC方法：对PEFT模块使用ZO优化，对分类器使用FO优化。

Result: ZO优化能增强稳定性（减少遗忘）但会损害可塑性（学习新知识能力）。ZO-FC方法在保持内存效率的同时，有效平衡了稳定性和可塑性。

Conclusion: ZO-FC提供了一种实用且内存高效的持续学习解决方案，特别适用于设备端部署场景。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support
reproducibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了物理一致性神经算子(PCNO)和扩散模型增强的PCNO(DiffPCNO)，用于高精度、物理一致且不确定性感知的时空预测，解决了现有方法忽略物理定律和不确定性量化的问题。

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法在长期时空动态预测中往往忽略物理定律，且无法量化预测中的固有不确定性，这限制了其在科学和工程领域的应用。

Method: PCNO通过物理一致性投影层在傅里叶空间中强制执行质量和动量守恒；DiffPCNO在确定性预测基础上，利用一致性模型来量化和减轻不确定性。

Result: PCNO和DiffPCNO在从湍流建模到真实世界洪水/大气预测的多种系统和空间分辨率下，实现了高保真度的时空预测，同时保持了物理一致性和不确定性。

Conclusion: 该两阶段框架为准确、物理基础扎实且不确定性感知的时空预测提供了一种稳健且通用的方法。

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

TL;DR: 提出了关键词检测作为脑机接口的实用中间任务，使用LibriBrain语料库建立标准化基准，开发了紧凑的1-D Conv/ResNet基线模型，在保持会话上达到约13倍置换基线的AUPRC性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前非侵入式脑机接口基准主要针对简单的语音检测和音素分类任务，而像脑到文本这样的应用级任务结果仍然难以实现。需要找到既实用又保护隐私的中间任务。

Method: 使用52小时的LibriBrain语料库，提供标准化的训练/验证/测试分割，采用针对极端类别不平衡的评估协议（AUPRC和FA/h指标）。开发了紧凑的1-D Conv/ResNet基线模型，使用焦点损失和top-k池化，可在单个消费级GPU上训练。

Conclusion: 关键词检测是脑机接口可行的中间任务，具有实际应用潜力。建立的基准和工具将促进社区进一步研究。

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

Motivation: 解决传统多目标优化方法在在线设置下效率低、难以融入用户主观偏好、需要显式计算超体积的问题。

Method: 使用类别概率估计器预测非支配关系，结合偏好方向向量编码用户偏好，构建可条件生成的帕累托集生成模型。

Result: 在合成基准和蛋白质设计任务中表现出优秀的样本效率和有效的偏好融入能力。

Conclusion: A-GPS是一个简单而强大的方法，能够高效生成高质量帕累托集近似，灵活捕捉用户偏好，无需重新训练即可在帕累托前沿采样。

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Motivation: 解决现有文献中两个关键限制：缺乏无损舍入方案来保证整数解与分数解性能相当，以及处理多类别代理带来的挑战。

Method: 基于松弛-舍入框架的随机算法，首先使用资源预留机制计算分数解以强制执行类别间公平性，然后通过无损舍入步骤保持公平性且不降低性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为在线多类选择问题提供了有效的公平分配解决方案，通过创新的舍入方案和资源预留机制解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the
quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset
(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed
and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and
mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach
offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring
complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale
in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made
publicly available to advance future studies of solar wind dynamics and space
weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are

Result: 该方法在两项挑战性基准测试中与自一致性等复杂方法表现相当，同时显著减少计算开销。

Conclusion: 最短答案启发式方法提供了相对于自一致性的帕累托改进，适用于输出相等性定义不明确的任务。

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Motivation: 移动设备计算资源有限，但其统一内存架构和CPU-GPU性能差距缩小为协同执行提供了机会，主要挑战是同步开销和执行时间预测困难。

Method: 使用OpenCL细粒度共享虚拟内存实现轻量级同步，并开发机器学习模型准确预测CPU和GPU任务执行时间（包括GPU内核调度时间）。

Conclusion: 该方法能快速选择CPU-GPU协同执行策略，有效提升移动设备上深度学习推理性能，接近理论最优值。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

Conclusion: DictPFL首次证明基于同态加密的私有联邦学习在实际部署中是可行的，其运行时间仅比明文联邦学习慢2倍以内。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available

Result: 在五个标准FSMPP基准测试中，该方法持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 将全局基序知识与细粒度局部上下文相结合，能够有效推进鲁棒的少样本分子属性预测。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着环境变得更加真实，POMDP中的信念分布变得复杂，标准数学模型无法准确捕捉，导致信念近似误差和次优决策行为。现有方法难以准确表示高维多模态信念分布。

Method: ESCORT扩展了SVGD，引入两个关键创新：相关感知投影来建模状态维度间的依赖关系，以及时间一致性约束来稳定更新同时保持相关结构。该方法保持SVGD的吸引-排斥粒子动力学，同时能准确建模复杂相关模式。

Result: 在POMDP领域和合成多模态分布上的广泛评估表明，ESCORT在信念近似准确性和下游决策质量方面持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: ESCORT能够动态适应信念景观的复杂性，无需重采样或限制性分布假设，为复杂高维多模态信念分布提供了有效的近似解决方案。

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

Conclusion: 该方法能够平衡不同群体间的下游预测性能，为成本敏感的特征选择问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于DDPG的两层调度框架，用于在异构云-雾-边缘基础设施上最小化医疗物联网顺序工作流的完工时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗物联网对顺序医疗工作流有严格的端到端延迟要求，而调度这些工作流以最小化完工时间是一个NP难问题。

Method: 采用分层调度决策：全局控制器进行层选择（边缘、雾或云），专门的本地控制器处理选定层内的节点分配。

Result: 实验结果表明，随着工作流复杂度的增加，该框架相比基线方法表现出越来越优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够学习有效的长期策略，这对于复杂、大规模的医疗物联网调度场景至关重要。

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的矩阵分解框架，将经典和鲁棒聚类统一起来。重新推导了k-means聚类与矩阵分解的等价关系，并首次形式化了模糊c-means的矩阵分解解释。通过用l1,2范数替换Frobenius范数，提出了鲁棒聚类变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的聚类方法缺乏统一的数学框架，且对异常值敏感。需要建立一个能够同时涵盖经典聚类（k-means）和模糊聚类（c-means）的矩阵分解框架，并开发对异常值具有鲁棒性的变体。

Method: 1. 重新推导k-means与矩阵分解的等价关系；2. 首次形式化模糊c-means的矩阵分解解释；3. 用l1,2范数替换Frobenius范数构建鲁棒变体；4. 开发交替最小化算法和IRLS算法。

Result: 成功建立了统一的矩阵分解框架，将经典聚类和模糊聚类统一表达为因子矩阵优化问题。提出的鲁棒变体能够有效处理异常值，所有算法都理论证明了收敛到局部最小值。

Conclusion: 该框架为聚类分析提供了统一的数学基础，鲁棒变体显著提高了对异常值的鲁棒性。交替最小化和IRLS算法确保了计算可行性，为聚类方法的进一步发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

TL;DR: 提出一个可视化大数据系统，用于处理气象数据并进行预测分析，系统融合不同时空聚合级别的数据，使用单变量和多变量方法进行预测，在缺失值高的情况下使用邻近站点数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气象领域产生大量数据，具有高容量、高维度、经常存在缺失值以及变量间高度相关的特点，需要利用大数据和数据挖掘技术来处理这些数据并从中提取有用知识。

Method: 系统收集开放数据并加载到本地NoSQL数据库中，在不同时空聚合级别融合数据，使用单变量和多变量方法进行预测分析，对于高缺失值情况使用邻近站点的训练数据进行预测。

Result: 系统在可用性和预测性能方面得到评估，总体归一化均方误差为0.00013，总体方向对称性接近0.84。专家对系统各方面（除图形设计外）评分均在3分以上（1-5分制）。

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个双层最大-最大优化框架用于委托-代理合同设计，使用隐式微分和共轭梯度法计算超梯度，无需形成或求逆Hessian矩阵，能够处理非线性效用、随机动态和高维动作的复杂合同设计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的线性-二次模型（如Holmström-Milgrom）有闭式解，但现实环境中非线性效用、随机动态或高维动作的合同设计问题通常没有闭式解，需要新的计算方法。

Method: 采用现代机器学习中的双层优化技术，使用隐式微分结合共轭梯度法，通过Hessian-向量积高效计算超梯度，避免直接形成或求逆Hessian矩阵。

Result: 在基准CARA-Normal环境中能够恢复已知解析最优解，从随机初始化可靠收敛。框架可扩展到复杂非线性合同，如S型工资表、相对绩效补偿、多任务合同和CARA-Poisson计数模型。

Conclusion: 为合同设计提供了新的计算工具，使得研究那些在分析上难以处理的模型成为可能，扩展了合同理论的计算能力。

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePULSe是一种新的强化学习训练方法，通过添加额外损失函数来引导采样低奖励输出并降低其概率，从而在期望奖励和不良输出概率之间实现更好的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准强化学习方法优化平均奖励，而专注于减少不良输出概率的方法通常以牺牲平均性能为代价。需要改进这种权衡关系。

Method: 在标准RL损失基础上增加额外损失，使用学习到的提议来引导采样低奖励输出，然后降低这些输出的概率。

Result: 实验表明RePULSe在期望奖励与不良输出概率之间提供了更好的权衡，并且比标准RL对齐方法和替代方案更具对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RePULSe方法能够有效改善语言模型对齐中的权衡问题，在保持期望奖励的同时更好地控制不良输出的概率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习需要模型在不断适应新任务的同时不遗忘过去的知识，现有方法在基础模型的持续学习中存在效率低下和干扰问题。

Method: 扩展LoRA框架，引入任务特定的正交基向量，通过基于扰动的优化策略最小化冲突，并采用选择机制识别干扰敏感度最小的基向量。

Result: 在标准持续学习基准测试中，PLAN持续优于现有方法，为基础模型的持续学习建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: PLAN通过主动的子空间管理和干扰感知的微调策略，有效解决了基础模型在持续学习中的知识遗忘问题，实现了高效的新任务适应。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

TL;DR: GenReview是迄今为止最大的包含LLM撰写评审的数据集，包含81K条通过三种不同提示（负面、正面、中性）为ICLR 2018-2025所有投稿生成的评审，用于研究LLM在科学同行评审中的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在科学同行评审中的日益普及，需要全面数据集来理解其效用和影响。现有研究缺乏这样的数据集，特别是在ICLR等会议上已出现LLM被默许使用的情况。

Method: 创建GenReview数据集，为ICLR 2018-2025所有投稿使用三种独立提示（负面、正面、中性）生成81K条LLM评审，并与原始论文和评审关联。

Result: 研究发现：LLM在评审中存在偏见；LLM撰写的评审目前可以自动检测；LLM并不总能严格遵循评审指南；LLM提供的评分仅与论文接受决定一致。

Conclusion: GenReview填补了LLM在科学评审研究中的数据空白，为理解LLM在同行评审中的影响提供了重要资源，揭示了当前LLM评审的局限性。

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于成对铰链损失的二阶代理损失函数，开发高效在线算法优化AUC，相比传统方法获得更紧的O(ln T)遗憾界，并在非线性设置下扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUC是分类任务中重要性能指标，但直接优化面临非凸不连续的成对0/1损失难以优化，以及大规模应用中实例存储内存成本高的挑战。

Method: 提出新范式：用训练数据的一阶和二阶统计量构建代理损失函数直接替代整个聚合的成对损失，而非传统方法对每个成对损失项进行实例级近似。

Result: 理论分析显示现有在线AUC优化算法通常达到O(√T)遗憾界，而本方法获得更紧的O(ln T)界；多基准数据集实验证明该二阶代理损失在优化在线AUC性能方面具有优越效率和效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的二阶代理损失方法有效解决了AUC优化的挑战，在理论和实验上均表现出色，为大规模在线AUC优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

Conclusion: 合成先验分布的设计对表格基础模型的泛化能力至关重要，Mitra证明了精心设计的先验混合能够显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速扩展使得低精度训练变得至关重要，但现有收敛理论假设所有组件都是精确的，忽略了硬件感知量化，无法解释为什么低精度训练仍然有效。

Method: 引入首个理论框架分析自适应优化器在梯度、权重和优化器状态浮点量化下的收敛性，推导平滑非凸目标下的收敛速率，明确量化不同组件的量化误差对收敛的影响。

Result: 分析表明，只要尾数长度随迭代次数对数增长，两种算法都能保持接近全精度对应算法的收敛速率。Adam对权重和第二矩量化高度敏感，而Muon需要更弱的误差控制，因此可能更稳健。

Conclusion: 这些结果缩小了低精度训练方法的经验成功与理论理解之间的差距，数值实验验证了理论分析。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

Motivation: 图神经网络面临适应性挑战，固定消息传递架构难以处理现实世界图的多样性，而现有图MoE方法依赖监督信号且训练不稳定。

Method: 采用骨干-残差专家架构，基础编码器提供稳定性，专用残差专家捕获多样化计算模式，结构感知门控网络进行细粒度节点路由，通过统一无监督目标端到端训练。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着超人类模型变得日益复杂，准确监督其行为可能超出人类能力。在分布偏移情况下，简单的弱到强泛化方法会失败，导致强模型性能比弱监督者更差。

Method: 提出RAVEN框架，动态学习弱模型的最优组合以及强模型的参数，自动识别可信的监督源。

Result: 在图像分类、文本分类和偏好对齐任务中，RAVEN在分布外任务上比基线方法提升超过30%，在分布内任务上匹配或超越现有方法。

Conclusion: RAVEN能够有效解决分布偏移下的弱到强泛化问题，自动为更准确的弱模型分配更高权重，展示了其识别可信监督的能力。

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

Conclusion: 将物理语义嵌入生成流可以将不透明的神经轨迹转化为可解释的物理过程

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs)框架，通过建模输入表示空间而非参数空间来进行模型合并，使用合成输入来捕获任务特定的功能偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法在参数空间中操作，受到参数不一致性的限制，需要更鲁棒和灵活的方法。

Method: 使用功能性双锚点(FDAs)作为合成输入，其诱导的梯度与任务向量对齐，捕获相对于预训练模型的任务特定功能偏移。

Result: 综合实验证明FDAs在模型合并中的有效性，且与参数空间模型合并方法互补。

Conclusion: FDA框架为联合多任务训练和后验合并提供了桥梁，提供了鲁棒性和灵活性。

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

TL;DR: 本研究通过用户实验评估了透明AI辅助在睡眠医学中的效果，发现透明AI作为质量控制步骤使用时，比黑盒AI性能提升约30%，且用户更倾向于采用透明系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在生物医学信号解释方面已能匹配或超越人类专家，但临床实践中需要让医生了解何时以及为何信任AI建议，才能有效整合AI到临床工作流程中。

Method: 对8名专业睡眠医学从业者进行应用导向的用户研究，在三种条件下对多导睡眠图中的夜间觉醒事件进行评分：(i)手动评分，(ii)黑盒AI辅助，(iii)透明白盒AI辅助。辅助在评分开始时或作为事后质量控制提供。

Conclusion: 策略性定时的透明AI辅助能有效平衡准确性和临床效率，为临床工作流程中可信AI整合和用户接受提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

Result: 实证研究表明，可实现的混淆程度与近似模型中的不确定性相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果可能为深度基于模型的强化学习提供理论基础的探索策略信息。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

Result: 发现表征变化呈现非单调模式，适度相似项在学习后发生分化；词汇干扰（新关联与先验知识竞争）会放大这种分化效应

Conclusion: 大语言模型不仅是研究类人学习系统表征动态的强大工具，也是生成关于大脑记忆重组原理新假设的可访问通用计算模型

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法只能复制简单统计摘要，但无法保留定义真实世界系统复杂多变量交互的成对和高阶相关结构，导致合成数据在复杂建模任务中失效。

Method: 使用Cholesky分解目标相关矩阵，生成数学上保证保留完整相关结构（从简单成对关系到高阶交互）的合成数据集。

Result: 该方法提供了一种计算高效的合成数据生成技术，能够保留源数据集的完整相关结构。

Conclusion: GCM方法为合成数据生成提供了新途径，在隐私保护数据共享、鲁棒模型训练和模拟方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

Motivation: 二阶方法能提升PINNs的训练效果，但内存需求大，难以扩展到大型模型。需要找到既能利用二阶方法优势又能保持可扩展性的解决方案。

Method: 使用局部混合专家模型结合参数高效的集成模型和稀疏编码，实现可学习的域分解结构，并采用对抗自适应采样来适应PDE及其定义域。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了二阶训练的内存瓶颈问题，为PINNs的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

Motivation: 现有的任务感知蒸馏方法通常需要大量数据，但在许多实际场景中这些数据可能不可用或获取成本高昂。

Method: CoD策略利用反事实解释（能够以最小扰动翻转教师模型预测输出的输入）来精确映射教师决策边界，从统计和几何角度提供了理论保证。

Result: 在各种数据集和LLM上的实验表明，CoD在少样本场景（低至8-512个样本）中优于标准蒸馏方法，仅使用基线方法一半的原始样本及其对应的反事实解释仍能提高性能。

Conclusion: CoD通过反事实解释有效提升了少样本任务感知知识蒸馏的性能，为资源受限场景下的模型部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

Motivation: 图注意力在处理大规模节点时会出现过度聚合现象，即大量消息被不加区分地聚合到单个节点中，导致关键信息被稀释和信息丢失。

Method: Wideformer将节点聚合过程划分为并行处理，限制每次聚合的输入量，并通过排序和加权机制引导模型关注信息量大的子集。

Conclusion: Wideformer通过并行聚合和引导机制成功解决了图注意力中的过度聚合问题，为大规模图学习任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

Result: 在标准RL OOD测试套件中，DEEDEE性能匹配或超越现有检测器，计算量减少600倍，准确率平均提升5%。

Conclusion: RL轨迹中的多种异常类型可以通过少量低阶统计量捕获，为复杂环境中的OOD检测提供了紧凑基础。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

Conclusion: Buffer层方法有效解决了归一化层更新的根本限制，在真实世界域适应场景中展现出有效性和通用性。

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

Conclusion: 测试匹配的数据增强与基于变换器的集成相结合，是在噪声条件下实现稳健人类活动识别的有效策略。

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

Result: 发现：(1)GAMs解释复杂性受输入空间结构影响；(2)组件模型类型差异只在特定输入域下显现；(3)回归与分类任务的解释复杂性有显著区别；(4)神经网络加性化仅对某些解释方法和输入域有益。

Conclusion: 揭示了GAMs解释计算可行性的严格理论图景，明确了在何种条件下计算是可能的或可证明是困难的。

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPHAD是一个测试时自适应框架，用于处理训练数据被异常值污染的无监督异常检测问题，通过结合预训练模型和传统异常检测方法在测试时更新模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的无监督异常检测数据集往往包含未被检测到或错误标记的异常值，导致性能显著下降，而现有解决方案需要访问训练管道、数据或异常比例的先验知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出EPHAD框架，在测试时使用多模态基础模型（如CLIP）、经典异常检测方法（如潜在异常因子）或领域特定知识收集的证据，更新在污染数据集上训练的异常检测模型的输出。

Result: 在8个视觉异常检测数据集、26个表格异常检测数据集和1个真实工业异常检测数据集上的综合实验验证了EPHAD的有效性，消融研究分析了超参数影响和对不同污染水平的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EPHAD展示了在不同异常检测模型和证据对中的多功能性和鲁棒性，为解决训练数据污染的异常检测问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的概率框架，使用摊销变分推断直接逼近真实标签的后验分布，结合深度学习的表达能力与概率建模的严谨性，在部分标签学习中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据通常存在噪声和歧义，在众包标注中人类标注者可能对同一实例分配冲突的类别标签。部分标签学习旨在处理每个实例与一组候选标签相关联的情况，其中只有一个标签是正确的。

Method: 采用摊销变分推断，使用神经网络从输入数据预测变分参数，直接逼近真实标签的后验分布，保持架构无关性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的理论分析和广泛实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将深度学习的表达能力与概率建模的严谨性相结合，为部分标签学习提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注建模选择对模型多样性的影响，而数据在塑造多样性中的关键作用被相对忽视。本文旨在研究单个数据点差异对模型多样性的影响。

Method: 引入邻接数据集框架分析单个数据点差异的影响，通过严格的数学证明验证发现，并将框架扩展到主动学习和数据插补两个实际领域。

Result: 发现与常规预期相反的现象：类间分布重叠更大的邻接数据集表现出更低的模型多样性，这是由于共享的Rashomon参数导致的。

Conclusion: 数据在模型多样性中扮演关键角色，提出的多重性感知方法在主动学习和数据插补中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单而通用的方法来解决多臂老虎机中的公平性问题，通过初始均匀探索加标准UCB算法实现了近最优的Nash遗憾，并推广到更广泛的p-均值遗憾度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多臂老虎机的遗憾度量无法解决奖励分配的公平性问题，特别是在需要公平分配奖励的场景中（如临床试验）。现有的Nash遗憾方法需要专门算法设计和强假设，限制了其适用性。

Method: 采用初始均匀探索阶段后接标准上置信界(UCB)算法，仅依赖加性Hoeffding界，可自然扩展到次高斯奖励分布。

Result: 该方法实现了近最优的Nash遗憾，并推广到p-均值遗憾度量，在所有p值上都能获得（近）最优遗憾界。

Conclusion: 提出的简单方法在保证公平性的同时，比现有方法具有更广泛的适用性和更好的理论保证，无需对老虎机实例做限制性假设。

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SANI是一种语言模型去记忆化方法，通过擦除和修复两个阶段来消除模型对敏感信息的记忆，无需昂贵的额外微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在特定任务微调时会记忆敏感数据（如医疗报告、商业数据），导致隐私泄露风险，需要一种无需重新训练的安全去记忆方法。

Method: 采用擦除和修复两阶段：1）重置模型最后几层的特定神经元以破坏细粒度信息记忆；2）避免记忆敏感信息的微调。

Result: 仅需少量去学习轮次即可有效净化模型，显著减少敏感信息泄露次数。

Conclusion: SANI为医院等行业提供了一种实用的模型净化方案，可在共享模型前有效保护敏感数据隐私。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCMC采样方法存在收敛慢、临界减速、模式混合差和高自相关等问题，而基于似然和对抗学习的模型需要大量数据且容易出现模式覆盖和模式塌陷问题。

Method: 提出ScoreNF框架，将归一化流架构与得分学习相结合，并集成独立Metropolis-Hastings模块，支持小训练集下的高效采样。

Result: 在合成2D分布（MOG-4和MOG-8）和高维φ4晶格场理论分布上的验证表明，该方法在采样任务中表现有效。

Conclusion: ScoreNF能够在减少对计算昂贵MCMC训练数据依赖的同时，保持高性能采样，并提供了评估模式覆盖和模式塌陷行为的方法。

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

Conclusion: 该神经网络框架为小型抵押债券市场提供了有效的收益率曲线估计工具，允许从业者在平滑性和准确性之间进行权衡。

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

Motivation: MCTD虽然结合了扩散模型和树搜索进行轨迹探索，但受限于训练轨迹长度，且规划过程局限于局部轨迹搜索，缺乏全局上下文。需要提升到组合式规划层面。

Method: 提出C-MCTD框架，包含三个组件：在线组合器进行全局感知规划，分布式组合器通过多起点并行探索降低搜索复杂度，预规划组合器利用缓存计划图加速推理。

Result: C-MCTD能够进行全局感知的规划，在多个起点并行探索，并利用缓存机制加速推理过程。

Conclusion: C-MCTD成功将规划从单轨迹优化扩展到完整规划组合推理，解决了MCTD的局限性，实现了更高效的组合式规划。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

Conclusion: 提出的OTCIL框架通过前向正则化和贝叶斯自适应机制，能够有效抵抗遗忘、避免过去重放，在在线任务无关类增量学习中取得优越性能。

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is

Conclusion: 提出的组合偏置框架通过调整混合策略即可实现多种因子的解耦，具有灵活性和通用性。

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion

### [139] [A Rapid Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework Based on Extreme Learning Machine for Inverse Stefan Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21426)
*Pei-Zhi Zhuang,Ming-Yue Yang,Fei Ren,Hong-Ya Yue,He Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息的极限学习机(PIELM)框架，用于解决逆Stefan问题，相比传统PINNs方法，在精度和训练效率方面都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在解决Stefan问题时存在超参数依赖性强、训练效率低和预测精度不足的问题，需要开发更高效准确的方法。

Method: 使用极限学习机网络替代传统深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过最小二乘法优化由初始边界条件和控制偏微分方程构成的物理规律损失向量来确定输出权重。

Result: 案例研究表明，PIELM相比传统PINNs，相对L2误差提高了3-7个数量级的精度，同时节省了超过94%的训练时间。

Conclusion: PIELM框架为逆Stefan问题提供了一种快速、准确的物理信息学习方法，在精度和效率方面都优于传统PINNs方法。

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

*Hao Liang,Shuqing Shi,Yudi Zhang,Biwei Huang,Yali Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSAC框架结合因果表示学习和元actor-critic学习，通过稀疏局部因果掩码和近似紧凑表示实现大规模网络系统的可扩展性和领域泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模网络系统（如交通、电力、无线网格）中强化学习面临的规模和环境变化挑战。

Method: 每个智能体学习稀疏局部因果掩码识别影响其动态的最小邻域变量，生成状态和领域因子的近似紧凑表示；元actor-critic在多个源域上训练共享策略，并在测试时通过少量轨迹估计新领域因子。

Result: GSAC能够快速适应新领域，显著优于从头学习和传统适应基线方法。

Conclusion: GSAC通过因果表示和元学习实现了大规模网络系统的可扩展性和领域泛化，具有有限样本保证的因果恢复、actor-critic收敛和适应差距。

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

### [141] [Unified token representations for sequential decision models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21448)
*Zhuojing Tian,Yushu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统一令牌表示(UTR)，将回报目标、状态和动作合并为单个令牌，显著减少序列长度和模型复杂度，在保持或提升性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Decision Transformer存在冗余令牌化和二次注意力复杂度问题，限制了在实时或资源受限环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 开发统一令牌表示(UTR)，将回报目标、状态和动作合并为单个令牌，并基于transformer和门控CNN分别构建UDT和UDC两个变体。

Result: UTR在保持或优于最先进方法性能的同时，显著降低了计算复杂度，理论分析显示其具有更紧的Rademacher复杂度界限。

Conclusion: UTR在不同架构上泛化良好，可能为未来大规模决策模型提供高效基础。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

*Federico Danieli,Pau Rodriguez,Miguel Sarabia,Xavier Suau,Luca Zappella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ParaRNN框架通过牛顿迭代和并行归约技术，首次实现了非线性RNN的序列并行化训练，在7B参数规模下达到与Transformer和Mamba2相当的困惑度，速度提升高达665倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN由于序列依赖性无法并行计算，而现有的并行架构如Transformer和SSM在线性约束下表达能力受限，无法建模复杂的非线性序列依赖关系。

Method: 将非线性递归关系转化为方程组系统，使用牛顿迭代结合自定义并行归约进行并行求解，应用于LSTM和GRU等非线性RNN架构。

Result: 实现了665倍的速度提升，成功训练7B参数的非线性RNN模型，困惑度与同等规模的Transformer和Mamba2相当。

Conclusion: ParaRNN突破了非线性RNN的序列并行化障碍，为大规模非线性序列建模提供了可行方案，并开源代码框架促进相关研究。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出将个性化解释作为推荐本身来学习，通过预测用户可能拍摄的照片来解释推荐系统的输出，从而提高系统可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释复杂系统（如推荐系统）的输出对用户和公司都越来越重要。作者认为用户上传的照片可以强化或证明他们对物品的评价，因此预测用户会拍摄什么照片可以作为最有说服力的解释。

Method: 提出了一个形式化框架来估计给定（用户，照片）对的作者概率。使用TripAdvisor收集的餐厅评论（包含照片）数据进行实证研究。

Result: 通过预测用户可能拍摄的照片，推荐系统可以解释其推荐结果并提高可靠性。同时，公司可以获得关于客户关注产品哪些方面的生动知识。

Conclusion: 将个性化解释作为推荐本身学习是可行的，这种方法不仅能提高推荐系统的可信度，还能帮助企业更好地理解客户偏好。

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出HINet方法，结合图神经网络和领域对抗训练，用于估计网络环境中的异质处理效应，解决未知暴露映射和网络级协变量偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果机器学习方法通常假设已知暴露映射，这在现实中往往不切实际；同时同质性和处理分配机制的交互会导致网络级协变量偏移，影响处理效应估计的准确性。

Method: HINet方法整合图神经网络和领域对抗训练，能够在未知暴露映射的情况下估计处理效应，并减轻网络级协变量偏移的影响。

Result: 在合成和半合成网络数据集上的广泛实证评估证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HINet方法能够有效解决网络环境中异质处理效应估计的挑战，特别是在未知暴露映射和协变量偏移的情况下。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了ZEN，一种零参数超图神经网络，通过闭式解和冗余感知传播方案，在少样本节点分类任务中实现了高性能和高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超图神经网络在编码高阶结构时存在过拟合和可扩展性问题，需要既表达能力强又高效的模型。

Method: 基于线性化超图神经网络的统一公式，引入可处理的权重矩阵闭式解和冗余感知传播方案，避免迭代训练并消除冗余自信息。

Result: 在11个真实世界超图基准测试中，ZEN在分类准确率上持续优于8个基线模型，同时实现高达696倍的加速。

Conclusion: ZEN不仅性能优越，决策过程完全可解释，为数据集特征提供了洞察。

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进联邦时间序列预测系统中的持续学习提供了必要的工具和见解，并发布了可复现的开源框架。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了分布集合在{0,1}^ℕ上的均值一致估计问题，提出了UME-learnability概念，证明了均值向量可分性是UME-learnability的充分条件但非必要条件，并解决了关于可数并集UME-learnability的猜想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Vapnik和Chervonenkis(1971)关于经验均值估计器的一致收敛框架，引入Uniform Mean Estimability(UME-learnability)概念，研究任意估计器下分布集合的均值一致估计条件。

Method: 在分布集合的均值向量空间上工作，分析均值向量可分性与UME-learnability的关系，构造非可分但UME-learnable的分布集合反例，并研究可数并集的UME-learnability性质。

Result: 证明了均值向量可分性是UME-learnability的充分条件，但构造反例表明非必要条件，建立了可数并集的UME-learnability性质，解决了Cohen等人(2025)的猜想。

Conclusion: UME-learnability比传统的P-Glivenko-Cantelli框架更广泛，均值向量可分性提供了充分但不必要的条件，可数并集保持UME-learnability性质。

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成流网络能够根据奖励函数采样高奖励的复杂对象，但奖励函数通常是从噪声数据中近似估计的，导致学习策略存在认知不确定性。

Method: 构建一个由多项式混沌展开组成的代理模型，在少量训练好的流网络上拟合，学习奖励函数与流网络轨迹中每一步动作概率分布之间的关系。

Result: 在离散和连续网格世界、符号回归以及贝叶斯结构学习任务上验证了方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该代理模型可用于廉价的蒙特卡洛采样，估计在不确定奖励下的策略不确定性。

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统一模型(UM)解决8种灾后道路评估变体问题，通过单一神经网络同时处理多种配置，相比单独训练模型减少8倍训练时间和参数，在解质量上优于单任务DRL方法6-14%，优于传统优化方法24-82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后道路评估对应急响应至关重要，但现有方法存在扩展性差、需要领域专业知识、单任务模型缺乏适应性等问题，无法满足动态灾害场景的需求。

Method: 采用现代transformer编码器-解码器架构，通过跨多个问题配置训练单一神经网络，结合轻量级适配器机制实现高效微调，无需重新训练即可适应未见属性。

Result: 模型在1000节点网络中实现实时求解(1-10秒)，微调实验表明能以最小成本有效整合未见属性并保持高解质量，敏感性分析证实了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UM为基于无人机的灾后道路评估提供了计算高效、高质量且适应性强的解决方案，推动了时间关键应用的神经组合优化发展。

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

TL;DR: 论文研究了使用探针作为训练信号时面临的Goodhart定律问题，提出了基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的两种方法，发现在偏好学习目标下探针可检测性保持得更好，且重新训练探针比使用探针集成更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探针能检测模型内部的不良行为（如欺骗或偏见），但将其作为训练目标时可能因Goodhart定律而失效，需要研究如何在使用探针训练的同时保持其可靠性。

Method: 提出两种基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的探针训练方法，在毒性减少测试平台上评估，尝试使用探针集成、保留未训练探针和训练后重新训练探针来保持检测准确性。

Result: 基于探针的偏好优化比基于分类器的方法更好地保持了探针可检测性；探针多样性带来的益处有限，训练后重新训练探针即可恢复高检测准确率。

Conclusion: 基于探针的训练在某些对齐方法中可行，当重新训练可行时，探针集成基本没有必要。

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为时空区域扭曲(SRD)的伪异常生成方法，通过增强弱监督视频异常检测模型的对抗鲁棒性来解决现有模型易受对抗攻击的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督视频异常检测模型容易受到对抗攻击，但由于只有视频级标签而缺乏帧级监督，传统的对抗训练方法效果不佳。直接使用模型生成的伪标签进行帧级对抗训练会因标签噪声导致性能下降。

Method: 提出SRD方法，通过对正常视频中的局部区域应用严重增强来创建合成异常，同时保持时间一致性。将这些精确标注的合成异常与噪声伪标签结合，显著减少标签噪声，实现有效的对抗训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了WSVAD模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，整体AUROC性能平均比最先进方法高出71.0%。

Conclusion: SRD方法通过生成精确标注的合成异常，有效解决了弱监督设置下对抗训练的标签噪声问题，显著增强了模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了修订相似性问题，并设计了一种新的静态度量方法——切除分数(ES)，通过移除现有文档与修订版本之间的共享内容，专注于比较差异区域，从而更好地与人类判断保持一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的成对度量方法（如BLEU）在评估文档修订时存在根本缺陷，因为它们的分值被共享内容主导，无法准确反映人类对修订差异的判断。

Method: 提出切除分数(ES)方法，使用最长公共子序列(LCS)移除现有文档与真实修订和预测修订之间的共享内容，然后仅比较剩余的不同区域。通过近似方法将标准立方LCS计算加速到二次复杂度。

Result: 在代码编辑评估中，ES超越了现有度量方法。在HumanEvalFix上与测试执行对齐时，ES比最接近的竞争对手SARI提高了12%的皮尔逊相关性，比标准度量如BLEU提高了>21%。当增加共享上下文时，ES对SARI的改进增加到20%，对标准度量的改进>30%。

Conclusion: ES方法通过专注于修订的差异区域，解决了现有度量方法在修订相似性评估中的根本缺陷，能够更好地与人类判断保持一致，并有效处理代码块移动、插入删除匹配等特殊情况。

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

Motivation: 空天地一体化多接入边缘计算为低空经济提供灵活计算服务，但面临异构节点协调、移动性和网络变化建模、部分可观测环境下实时决策等挑战。

Method: 提出分层SAGIN-MEC架构，使用MADDPG算法优化连续时间决策，结合凸优化和联盟博弈方法处理混合和变维度决策。

Result: 相比基准算法，显著降低了用户设备总成本、任务完成延迟和能耗，无人机能耗略有增加，且具有更好的收敛稳定性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: MADDPG-COCG算法有效解决了SAGIN-MEC系统中的复杂优化问题，提升了用户中心性能，为低空经济应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动ECG诊断系统在透明性和对未见病症的泛化能力方面存在不足，需要与临床工作流程对齐的可解释方法。

Method: 使用LLM辅助、专家验证过程构建结构化正负临床观察，通过预训练多模态模型对齐ECG和文本嵌入，模拟鉴别诊断过程。

Result: 实证评估显示ZETA在零样本分类性能上具有竞争力，并在定性和定量上证明了增强的可解释性，将预测基于具体的临床相关诊断特征。

Conclusion: ZETA展示了将ECG分析与结构化临床知识对齐的潜力，可构建更透明、可泛化和可信赖的AI诊断系统。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Motivation: 神经网络擅长处理非结构化数据但泛化能力差，经典算法保证正确性但缺乏灵活性，探索将两者结合能否提升图神经网络在分子预测任务上的表现。

Method: 在CLRS算法推理基准的24个经典算法上预训练图神经网络，然后用预训练模型初始化和冻结分子预测任务的特定层。

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

Conclusion: 深度神经网络通过层次化密度峰值构建语义表示，冗余神经元在正则化且训练误差为零时出现，有助于泛化而非过拟合。

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

TL;DR: REVE是一个专门为处理多样化EEG信号设计的预训练模型，通过新颖的4D位置编码方案和掩码自编码目标，在超过60,000小时的EEG数据上预训练，在10个下游任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型由于公共数据集的异质性（不同协议、设备和电极配置）而难以泛化，通常限制在单一设置下预训练，导致性能不佳，特别是在线性探测下。

Method: 引入4D位置编码方案处理任意长度和电极排列的信号，使用掩码自编码目标在92个数据集、25,000名受试者的60,000+小时EEG数据上进行预训练。

Result: 在10个下游EEG任务上达到最先进结果，包括运动想象分类、癫痫检测、睡眠分期、认知负荷估计和情绪识别，展示出强大的泛化能力和精细的时空建模。

Conclusion: REVE通过大规模预训练和创新的位置编码，显著提升了EEG基础模型的泛化能力，为标准化EEG研究和临床神经科学进展提供了支持。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

TL;DR: 提出HOPSS算法，通过同源扰动在解空间中直接生成训练数据集，显著减少数据生成所需的时间步数，降低计算开销，同时保持模型训练精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动深度学习方法需要大量解对数据，这些数据通常通过传统数值方法生成，需要数千个时间步迭代，计算和时间开销巨大。

Method: 首先从可靠求解器获取基础解函数并进行时间步下采样对齐，然后通过同源扰动方法（将一个解函数作为主函数，另一个作为同源扰动项与随机噪声结合）高效生成精度相当的PDE数据点，最后计算原方程右侧变化形成新的解对。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明HOPSS降低了时间复杂度，例如在Navier-Stokes方程上，生成10,000个样本仅需传统方法约10%的时间，且模型训练性能相当。

Conclusion: HOPSS算法能够显著加速PDE训练数据集的生成，同时保持训练精度，为数据驱动的深度学习求解非线性时间PDE提供了高效的数据生成方案。

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

Conclusion: 网络宽度而非深度是SHAP计算的主要计算瓶颈，张量网络框架为多种模型的SHAP计算提供了统一的复杂度分析工具。

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

TL;DR: 本文建立了在流行度调整块模型(PABM)下图聚类的理论极限，解决了现有模型的局限性。PABM引入了簇内和簇间连接的独立流行度参数，相比SBM和DCBM能捕捉更丰富的度异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图聚类模型如SBM假设顶点度均匀，DCBM虽然允许度校正但跨簇应用统一的校正，无法捕捉簇内和簇间连接模式的局部差异。PABM旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 提出了PABM模型，该模型为簇内和簇间连接引入独立的流行度参数。理论分析了PABM下聚类的最优错误率，并通过数值实验验证了使用k^2个特征向量的谱聚类方法优于传统方法。

Result: 证明了在PABM中，即使传统边密度信号消失，只要簇内和簇间流行度系数不同，聚类恢复仍然可能。PABM的期望邻接矩阵秩在k到k^2之间，传统基于前k个特征向量的谱嵌入可能丢失重要结构信息。

Conclusion: PABM捕捉了DCBM忽略的度异质性维度：连接模式的局部差异可以独立于全局边密度增强簇可分性。包含k^2个特征向量的谱聚类方法在合成和真实数据集上表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解等变网络在不确定性估计方面的表现提供了理论基础，揭示了对称性在模型校准中的重要作用。

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

Motivation: 旨在开发一种通用方法，仅从群作用观测对中学习等变嵌入，而不依赖特定群的归纳偏置，以处理包括非阿贝尔群在内的各种群结构。

Method: 通过对比学习联合学习潜在空间和群表示，使群作用对应于可逆线性映射，在dSprites数据集上验证了离散旋转和平移的组合群。

Conclusion: 这是首个仅从群作用观测中成功实现通用编码器等变学习的方法，包括非平凡非阿贝尔群和受计算机视觉启发的积群。

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.
