### [1] [Large Language Models for Real-World IoT Device Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13817)
*Rameen Mahmood,Tousif Ahmed,Sai Teja Peddinti,Danny Yuxing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义推理的物联网设备识别方法，将设备识别重新定义为异构网络元数据的语言建模任务，使用量化LLaMA3.18B模型在最大真实世界IoT流量数据集上实现高精度识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备的快速扩张超出了当前识别方法的能力，给安全、隐私和网络问责带来重大风险，特别是在元数据不完整、嘈杂或被故意混淆的开放世界环境中。

Method: 构建语义推理管道，将设备识别重新定义为语言建模任务；使用基于互信息和熵的稳定性评分的大语言模型集成生成高保真供应商标签；通过课程学习对量化LLaMA3.18B模型进行指令调优。

Result: 在2,015个供应商上达到98.25%的top-1准确率和90.73%的宏准确率，同时对缺失字段、协议漂移和对抗性操作保持弹性。

Conclusion: 指令调优的大语言模型为大规模真实世界设备识别提供了可扩展和可解释的基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification
methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network
accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments,
where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated.
We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification
as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct
reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT
Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble
of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based
stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with
curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail
vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro
accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields,
protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT
testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests,
demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable
foundation for real-world device identification at scale.

### [2] [Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting for Robust Gradual Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13864)
*Zixi Wang,Yushe Cao,Yubo Huang,Jinzhu Wei,Jingzehua Xu,Shuai Zhang,Xin Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STDW的自训练动态加权方法，通过动态平衡源域和目标域损失贡献来增强渐进域适应的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统渐进域适应方法通过中间域和自训练缓解域偏移，但存在知识迁移效率低或中间数据不完整的问题。

Method: 引入动态加权机制，通过时变超参数ϱ控制域特定学习强度，结合自训练生成伪标签并优化加权目标函数进行迭代模型更新。

Result: 在旋转MNIST、颜色偏移MNIST、肖像数据集和Cover Type数据集上的实验表明，STDW优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为鲁棒渐进域适应提供了理论见解和实用框架，在动态现实场景中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The
code is available at https://github.com/Dramwig/STDW.

### [3] [Deep Edge Filter: Return of the Human-Crafted Layer in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13865)
*Dongkwan Lee,Junhoo Lee,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep Edge Filter通过高通滤波深度神经网络特征来提升模型泛化能力，假设高频分量包含任务相关语义信息，低频分量存储领域特定偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假设神经网络在深度特征的高频分量中编码任务相关语义信息，而在低频分量中存储领域特定偏差，因此需要分离可泛化表示。

Method: 从原始特征中减去低通滤波输出，隔离可泛化表示，同时保持架构完整性。

Result: 在视觉、文本、3D和音频等多个领域的实验结果显示，无论模型架构和数据模态如何，都能获得一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了特征稀疏化并有效隔离高频分量，为核心假设提供了实证验证。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass
filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability.
Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode
task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing
domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By
subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach
isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural
integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text,
3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of
model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces
feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components,
providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis. The code is available at

### [4] [CoLoR-GAN: Continual Few-Shot Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation in Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13869)
*Munsif Ali,Leonardo Rossi,Massimo Bertozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoLoR-GAN是一个用于生成对抗网络的持续少样本学习框架，通过低秩适配技术减少参数数量，在保持SOTA性能的同时显著降低资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOTA方法如LFS-GAN在每次训练迭代中引入大量新权重，长期来看参数负担显著。需要一种能同时处理少样本和持续学习，且参数效率更高的方法。

Method: 使用低秩张量适配模型到目标任务，提出LLoRA（LoRA in LoRA）技术优化卷积层适配器大小，并提供超参数选择的经验研究。

Result: 在多个基准CL和FS任务上实验证明，CoLoR-GAN高效且达到SOTA性能，同时资源需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: CoLoR-GAN通过低秩适配技术成功解决了GANs中持续少样本学习的挑战，在保持高性能的同时显著减少了参数数量。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from
a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible
quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become
significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper
introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual
few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank
adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and
CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to
target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required.
Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty
good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we
challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for
convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of
the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the
best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on
several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,
reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

### [5] [Joint Discriminative-Generative Modeling via Dual Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13872)
*Xuwang Yin,Claire Zhang,Julie Steele,Nir Shavit,Tony T. Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对抗训练的统一框架，同时实现鲁棒分类和高保真生成建模，解决了传统联合能量模型训练不稳定和样本质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联合能量模型（JEM）在单一框架中同时实现鲁棒分类和高质量生成存在挑战，主要受限于SGLD训练的不稳定性和样本质量差。

Method: 采用对抗训练原则，用稳定的AT方法替代SGLD，通过区分真实数据和PGD生成样本优化能量函数；结合对抗训练增强分类鲁棒性；采用两阶段训练解决批归一化与EBM不兼容问题。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著提升对抗鲁棒性，生成保真度超越BigGAN并接近扩散模型，是首个在复杂高分辨率数据集上实现高质量生成的MCMC-based EBM方法。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了JEM扩展的关键稳定性问题，证明对抗训练可作为统一视觉数据生成和鲁棒分类框架的有效基础。

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

### [6] [K-frames: Scene-Driven Any-k Keyframe Selection for long video understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13891)
*Yifeng Yao,Yike Yun,Jing Wang,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao,Ke Tian,Zhihao Wang,Minghui Qiu,Tao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-frames是一种新的场景驱动关键帧选择方法，通过预测语义连贯的查询相关片段来保持时间连续性，支持任意数量的关键帧选择以适应不同用户预算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中受到上下文窗口和计算成本的限制，均匀帧采样导致信息丢失，而现有关键帧选择方法产生稀疏且时间不连续的帧，忽略了场景连续性。

Method: 提出K-frames范式，通过预测语义连贯的查询相关片段来选择关键帧。使用三阶段渐进式课程学习：两个监督微调阶段用于时间定位和关键片段感知，以及一个强化学习阶段直接优化场景驱动预测策略。

Result: 在主要的长视频理解基准测试中，K-frames提供了有效、可解释且即插即用的多尺度关键帧选择解决方案。

Conclusion: K-frames通过场景驱动的关键帧选择方法，解决了长视频理解中的关键帧选择问题，保持了时间连续性并支持灵活的多尺度选择。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be
available.

### [7] [Multi-View Semi-Supervised Label Distribution Learning with Local Structure Complementarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13917)
*Yanshan Xiao,Kaihong Wu,Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出多视图半监督标签分布学习方法MVSS-LDL，通过利用各视图的局部最近邻结构并强调多视图间的互补性，解决了多视图半监督标签分布学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标签分布学习方法主要针对单视图和全监督场景，而多视图半监督标签分布学习问题尚未被考虑。

Method: 通过计算每个视图的k-最近邻，然后利用其他视图的最近邻信息来补充当前视图的最近邻集合，最后基于补充后的最近邻集合构建基于图学习的多视图半监督标签分布学习模型。

Result: 数值研究表明，MVSS-LDL比现有的单视图标签分布学习方法获得了明显更好的分类性能。

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试多视图标签分布学习，通过考虑局部最近邻结构的互补性，不同视图可以相互提供局部结构信息来补充彼此。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

### [8] [Weight Weaving: Parameter Pooling for Data-Free Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13921)
*Levy Chaves,Eduardo Valle,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Weight Weaving方法，通过用户定义的池化函数在λ值搜索空间中汇集模型权重，无需评估数据即可改进模型合并性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法严重依赖缩放超参数λ，但缺乏无需数据的λ设置原则方法，导致研究者不得不使用评估数据进行调优，这在实践中不可行。

Method: Weight Weaving技术使用用户定义的池化函数（如平均、随机选择或现有合并方法）在λ值搜索空间中汇集模型权重，具有高模块性和最小约束。

Result: 在三个ViT变体和三个实验设置（视觉多任务学习、持续学习和领域泛化）中验证，该方法持续改进多个模型合并方法的性能，在无数据设置下平均准确率提升高达15.9个百分点。

Conclusion: Weight Weaving是一种即插即用的正交技术，消除了评估数据需求，显著提升了模型合并方法的性能。

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

### [9] [LTR-ICD: A Learning-to-Rank Approach for Automatic ICD Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13922)
*Mohammad Mansoori,Amira Soliman,Farzaneh Etminani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将ICD编码分配视为检索系统问题的新方法，既考虑分类也考虑编码排序，相比传统分类方法在识别高优先级编码方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记中的ICD编码排序对医疗诊断和报销至关重要，但现有方法将其视为纯分类任务，忽略了编码顺序的重要性。

Method: 从检索系统角度处理该任务，将其制定为分类和排序问题，同时考虑ICD编码的分类和优先级排序。

Result: 在主要诊断编码排序准确率方面达到47%（相比现有最佳方法的20%），在分类指标上微平均F1分数0.6065和宏平均F1分数0.2904，均优于之前最佳模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在识别高优先级ICD编码方面具有显著优势，证明了考虑编码排序的重要性。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

### [10] [Distributional Consistency Loss: Beyond Pointwise Data Terms in Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13972)
*George Webber,Andrew J. Reader*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的数据一致性损失函数——分布一致性（DC）损失，用于解决逆问题中传统点对点匹配方法容易过拟合噪声的问题。DC损失通过检验观测测量值是否与当前估计所隐含的噪声分布统计一致，在分布层面进行校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据一致性损失函数（如均方误差MSE）追求与噪声测量值的点对点匹配，这往往导致对噪声的过拟合。作者希望开发一种能避免这种过拟合的数据一致性评估方法。

Method: 引入分布一致性（DC）损失，使用基于模型的概率分数对每个测量值进行分布层面的校准，而不是点对点匹配。该方法与现代正则化器兼容，优化方式与传统损失相同。

Result: 在图像去噪中，使用DC损失替代MSE损失无需提前停止训练即可获得更高的PSNR；在医学图像重建中，DC损失减少了高度迭代重建中的伪影，并增强了手工正则化的效果。

Conclusion: DC损失为逆问题提供了一个统计基础扎实、性能提升的替代方案，能够有效避免对测量噪声的过拟合，即使不使用先验信息也能发挥作用。

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BitNet Distillation (BitDistill) 是一种轻量级方法，可将全精度大语言模型微调为1.58位精度（三元权重{-1, 0, 1}），在特定下游任务中实现与全精度模型相当的性能，同时显著减少内存使用和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决全精度大语言模型在特定任务中计算成本高、内存占用大的问题，开发一种能够将模型压缩到极低精度但仍保持良好性能的方法。

Method: 结合三种关键技术：BitNet的SubLN模块、基于MiniLM的多头注意力蒸馏，以及作为关键预热步骤的持续预训练，以缓解全精度和1.58位模型在特定任务上的性能差距。

Result: 实验结果显示，BitDistill在不同模型规模下都能达到与全精度对应模型相当的性能，同时实现高达10倍的内存节省和2.65倍的CPU推理加速。

Conclusion: BitDistill提供了一种高效的方法，能够在保持任务特定性能的同时，显著降低大语言模型的计算和内存需求，使其更适合资源受限的环境部署。

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

### [12] [REAP the Experts: Why Pruning Prevails for One-Shot MoE compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13999)
*Mike Lasby,Ivan Lazarevich,Nish Sinnadurai,Sean Lie,Yani Ioannou,Vithursan Thangarasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出REAP方法，证明在生成任务中专家剪枝优于专家合并，通过考虑路由器门值和专家激活范数实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏激活的专家混合模型参数众多导致内存开销大，需要专家压缩。现有研究倾向于专家合并，但本文发现这对生成任务不利。

Method: 提出Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP)剪枝准则，综合考虑路由器门值和专家激活范数来选择要剪枝的专家。

Result: 在20B到1T参数的SMoE模型上，REAP在生成基准测试中始终优于合并和其他剪枝方法，特别是在50%压缩率下。在代码生成和工具调用任务中，即使剪枝50%专家也能实现近乎无损的压缩。

Conclusion: 专家剪枝是生成任务中更优的压缩策略，REAP方法通过避免功能子空间崩溃实现了高效的模型压缩。

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient
pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create
significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression.
Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative
benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for
generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by
causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's
independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we
propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning
criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms.
Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP
consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative
benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves
near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with
Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clifford-可操纵CNNs的核基不完备，限制了模型的表达能力，需要解决这一问题以提高模型性能。

Method: 提出条件Clifford-可操纵核，通过输入特征场的等变表示增强核，并通过隐式参数化高效求解等变约束。

Result: 在流体动力学和相对论电动力学等多个PDE预测任务中，该方法持续优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 条件Clifford-可操纵核有效解决了CSCNNs核基不完备的问题，显著提升了模型在PDE预测任务中的表达能力。

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Motivation: 现有的几何感知优化算法（如Muon）虽然通过为不同层选择适当范数来利用DNN的几何结构，但在同一范数组内的各层之间使用固定学习率，忽略了层间局部曲率的异质性和训练过程中的动态变化，导致训练效率不高。

Method: 在几何感知优化算法之上引入噪声自适应分层学习率方案，实时估计由所选线性最小化oracle诱导的对偶范数中的梯度方差，并利用该方差为每组内的各层分配随时间变化的噪声自适应学习率。

Result: 理论分析表明该算法实现了尖锐的收敛率。在LLaMA和GPT等transformer架构上的实证结果显示，该方法比现有最先进的优化器收敛更快。

Conclusion: 提出的噪声自适应分层学习率方案能够有效加速深度神经网络训练，特别是在transformer架构中表现出优于固定学习率方法的收敛性能。

Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved
remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods
leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for
different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear
minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated
with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and
vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows
that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout
training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to
layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme
on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate
DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each
group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the
chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive
layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results
on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our
approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

*Riccardo Zattra,Giacomo Baggio,Umberto Casti,Augusto Ferrante,Francesco Ticozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COFFEE模型是一种新型时变状态空间模型，通过引入状态反馈机制实现上下文依赖的选择性，在保持并行实现的同时显著提升了长序列依赖建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型存在二次复杂度问题和长序列依赖建模困难，而现有的S6模块虽然效率较高但选择性机制仅依赖当前输入，缺乏对序列历史的上下文理解。

Method: COFFEE模型将选择性机制从仅依赖当前输入改为基于内部状态计算，内部状态作为序列历史的紧凑表示，同时采用高效参数化方法消除S6中的冗余。

Result: 在induction head任务中，COFFEE以比S6少两个数量级的参数和训练序列达到接近完美的准确率；在MNIST上仅用3585个参数就达到97%准确率，大幅超越S6。

Conclusion: 状态反馈是构建可扩展高效序列模型的关键机制，COFFEE展示了通过状态反馈实现上下文依赖选择性的有效性。

Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most
foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties
in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has
shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the
S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art
results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE
(COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state
feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for
parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends
on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves
as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the
model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its
ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we
employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in
S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head
task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer
parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely
outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only
3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key
mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究双边市场中的定价和匹配算法，设计了一种基于在线学习的定价策略，在需求供给曲线未知的情况下实现接近最优的利润，同时控制队列长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在双边市场中，平台需要平衡利润最大化和队列长度控制。由于实际中需求供给曲线可能未知，需要设计能够在线学习并适应未知环境的算法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的在线学习定价策略，包含动态组件优化遗憾与队列长度的权衡，以及概率组件解决快速学习与队列控制之间的冲突。

Result: 证明了三种性能指标之间的权衡关系：Õ(T^{1-γ})遗憾、Õ(T^{γ/2})平均队列长度和Õ(T^{γ})最大队列长度，其中γ∈(0,1/6]，显著优于现有结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的定价策略在需求供给曲线未知的情况下实现了接近最优的性能，证明了遗憾与平均队列长度之间的权衡在允许的γ范围内是最优的。

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

Conclusion: 该基准为从业者和新手提供了选择或扩展适当CRL框架的经验见解，以解决可以从CRL视角受益的特定类型现实问题，项目页面和数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

*Alexandru Meterez,Depen Morwani,Jingfeng Wu,Costin-Andrei Oncescu,Cengiz Pehlevan,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Seesaw框架，通过同时调整学习率和批量大小来加速大语言模型预训练，在保持损失动态的同时减少串行步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批量大小递增是加速大语言模型预训练的有前景策略，但对于Adam等自适应优化器的最优策略尚不明确，通常需要启发式调优。

Method: 开发了Seesaw框架：当标准调度器将学习率减半时，Seesaw改为将学习率乘以1/√2并加倍批量大小，从而保持损失动态同时减少串行步骤。

Result: 在150M/300M/600M参数模型上，Seesaw在相同FLOPs下匹配余弦衰减性能，同时减少约36%的挂钟时间，接近理论极限。

Conclusion: Seesaw提供了批量大小调度的原则性框架，在保持训练质量的同时显著加速大语言模型预训练。

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

Conclusion: FedHFT框架能够有效解决联邦学习中的数据异构和资源异构问题，在保持数据本地化的同时实现高性能的协作模型微调。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究了稀疏maxout网络的表达能力，建立了网络与虚拟多面体之间的对偶关系，推导了深度层次结构，证明了在固定入度约束下宽度无法弥补深度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏maxout网络的表达能力，这类网络捕捉了卷积神经网络和图神经网络的关键特征，旨在理解其计算能力和结构限制。

Method: 建立了稀疏maxout网络与虚拟多面体类之间的对偶关系，利用多面体几何分析网络表达能力，推导了相关多面体的维度紧界。

Result: 构建了深度层次结构序列，证明足够深的稀疏maxout网络是通用的，但在固定入度约束下，如果深度不足，仅靠宽度无法弥补稀疏性限制。

Conclusion: 稀疏maxout网络的表达能力与深度密切相关，在固定入度约束下，深度是决定网络表达能力的关键因素，宽度无法替代深度的作用。

Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes
a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly
multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of
convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between
functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking
their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a
tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the
central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of
depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are
universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone
cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

<details>

Motivation: 随机对照试验依赖手工假设和昂贵分析，限制了因果效应估计的规模，可能遗漏重要发现。希望直接从数据中发现治疗的未知效应。

Method: 使用预训练基础模型将非结构化试验数据转化为有意义的表示，通过稀疏自编码器进行解释，采用递归分层过程解决多重检验和效应纠缠问题。

Result: 在半合成实验中验证了算法的鲁棒性，在实验生态学背景下首次成功实现了真实世界科学试验的无监督因果效应识别。

Conclusion: Neural Effect Search能够有效发现未知因果效应，为大规模因果发现提供了新途径。

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems represent one of the most fundamental formulations
used to describe a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes.
With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on
solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the
theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively
approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of
neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal
approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can
approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a
three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The
theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and
parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in
approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs,
providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential
equation solvers.

Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution
remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for
the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work
investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks
using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a
testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed
at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii)
algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete
bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively,
these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent
space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization
capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic
interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust
OOD generalization abilities.

Conclusion: TENDE提供了一种灵活、可扩展的传递熵估计方法，克服了现有方法的局限性，在多种应用场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional
assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We
address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer
Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages
score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural
estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks
and real data.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex
distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently,
they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network-driven robust optimisation framework that

Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind
emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study
Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised
algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks
without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the
algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what
drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by
its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the
reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and
exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these
exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state
space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved
understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.

Motivation: 传统简化模型在稀疏拓扑中低估吞吐量48-62%，精确马尔可夫链分析计算复杂度指数增长，标准GNN因对称归一化混淆干扰效应导致63.94%误差。

Method: 设计解耦图卷积网络(D-GCN)，用可学习注意力替代均值聚合，显式分离节点自身传输概率与邻居干扰效应，捕获复杂多跳干扰模式。

Conclusion: D-GCN通过结构化解耦设计有效解决无线网络吞吐量预测问题，为大规模网络分析提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but
predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks
remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared
interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse
topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in
computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These
computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like
GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet
off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean
absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization
conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects
that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional
Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a
node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN
replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable,
per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference
patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains
tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible,
and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of
theoretical optima.

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.
Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language
Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein
structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We
introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link
prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning
framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach
models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram
graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.
Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities
are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,
a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a
unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate
path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared
transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating
mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level
embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level
embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of
DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches
established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed
graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the
full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong
performance holds even with limited training data.

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

Abstract: In the evolving domains of Machine Learning and Data Analytics, existing

Motivation: 传统合并方法应用于低秩权重时会导致严重的性能下降，需要一种能够保持各任务模型性能的新方法。

Conclusion: 将合并重构为生成可重构模型空间而非单一合并模型，能够有效解决低秩模型合并的性能问题，实现更好的任务适应性。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

Conclusion: OCNOpt为基于动态系统和最优控制理论的算法设计开辟了新途径，证明了将最优控制理论应用于神经网络优化的有效性。

Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the
advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs
characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining
their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework
of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical
systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled
analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical
pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated
observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation
algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for
dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic
programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a
variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the
first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring
higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,
termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich
algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies,
game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time
models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt
improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining
manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled
algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.

Result: 在摩根大通部署消除了100万条话语积压，平均86%与人工标注一致，每年节省5000多小时人工工作；标注置信度分类为85%高、10%中、5%低；在内部意图分类数据集上比传统方法提升13.8% Top-1准确率、15.1% Top-5准确率、16.9% F1分数。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了理论多智能体系统与实际企业部署之间的差距，为面临类似标注挑战的组织提供了蓝图。

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

Motivation: 扩散模型擅长生成，但其潜在空间未明确组织以实现可解释控制。受对比学习能获得更解耦和结构化表示的启发，需要组织扩散潜在空间以反映底层动态因素。

Method: 在扩散嵌入中应用对比学习，使潜在几何与系统动态对齐，组织潜在空间使得遍历方向反映底层动态因素，支持非线性轨迹遍历。

Result: 在流体动力学、神经钙成像、治疗性神经刺激和面部表情等基准测试中，ConDA产生了比线性遍历和基于条件的基线方法具有更好可控性的可解释潜在表示。

Conclusion: 扩散潜在编码了动态相关结构，但利用这种结构需要潜在组织并沿着潜在流形进行遍历。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,
therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces
interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to
linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that
diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this
structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

TL;DR: 对分子核进行首次全面谱分析，发现更丰富的谱特征并不总是提高准确性，甚至可能与性能负相关。领先特征值（前2%）就能恢复几乎所有性能，挑战了"更丰富谱带来更好泛化"的常见启发式方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度模型在分子性质预测中达到最先进精度，但核方法因其在低数据环境下的鲁棒性和透明理论基础仍被广泛使用。尽管机器学习中核谱研究广泛，但分子核的系统谱分析却很稀缺。

Method: 在QM9数据集上对分子指纹、预训练transformer、全局和局部3D表示等七种分子性质进行核岭回归的全面谱分析，使用四种不同谱度量，并实现截断核来探究谱与预测性能的关系。

Result: 更丰富的谱特征不持续提高准确性。对于transformer和局部3D表示，谱丰富度甚至与性能呈负相关。在许多核中，仅保留前2%特征值就能恢复几乎所有性能，表明领先特征值捕获了最具信息量的特征。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了"更丰富谱带来更好泛化"的常见启发式方法，突出了表示、核特征和预测性能之间的微妙关系。这些发现为在数据有限的科学和实际任务中如何评估核和自监督学习方法提供了信息。

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经网络经验上成功，但仍易受微小对抗扰动影响。长期以来假设平坦极小值（损失景观中低曲率区域）能提高鲁棒性，但这种联系缺乏严格形式化分析。

Method: 首先推导了倒数第二层相对平坦度的闭式表达式，利用此约束输入空间中损失的变化，从而形式化分析整个网络的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 平坦性仅能保证局部鲁棒性，而要维持数据流形之外的鲁棒性，损失需要急剧弯曲。实验验证了理论预测，发现对抗样本常位于模型自信但错误的平坦区域。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了对平坦性的简化理解，提供了对其在鲁棒性中作用的细致理解：平坦性仅提供局部保护，全局鲁棒性需要损失景观的急剧变化。

Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small,
adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima,
regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness.
While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete.
By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only
partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial
robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression
for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this
to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to
formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show
that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to
curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical
predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the
geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking
flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat
regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified
views of flatness and provide a nuanced understanding of its role in
robustness.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical
for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments.
However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization
capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem
from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate
modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network
(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module
incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent
states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase
differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly
captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and
the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional
cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated
through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained
with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction
errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments
on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms
mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the
model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its
potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in
ocean engineering.

TL;DR: 本文对通用型和专用型时间序列基础模型在PPG信号处理上的性能进行了全面基准测试，发现专用模型在完全微调场景下胜率得分高出27%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型大多是专用模型，而通用模型如MOMENT开始出现。本文旨在系统比较这两种模型在PPG信号处理任务中的表现差异。

Method: 通过51个任务（包括心脏状态评估、实验室值估计和跨模态推理）的测试套件，从7个维度（胜率得分、平均性能、特征质量、调优增益、性能方差、可迁移性和可扩展性）全面评估模型。

Result: 在完全微调场景下，专用模型比通用模型获得27%更高的胜率得分。

Conclusion: 专用模型在PPG信号处理任务中表现更优，研究还分析了泛化性、公平性、注意力可视化以及训练数据选择的重要性。

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

TL;DR: 提出了CAST框架，通过直接估计变换矩阵和频谱分析来理解Transformer层的功能，为LLM可解释性提供了新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型作为黑盒的问题，现有可解释性方法各有局限，需要补充性的分析框架来理解模型内部机制。

Method: 使用Moore-Penrose伪逆估计每层的实际变换矩阵，应用频谱分析包含六个可解释指标来表征层行为，并进行核分析。

Result: 发现编码器和解码器模型行为差异：解码器呈现压缩-扩展循环，编码器保持一致的高秩处理；核相似性矩阵将层分为特征提取、压缩和专业化三个阶段。

Conclusion: CAST框架为Transformer层功能分析提供了有价值的补充视角，揭示了模型内部处理的不同阶段和模式。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

*Yutian Zhao,Chao Du,Xiaosen Zheng,Tianyu Pang,Min Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于扩散模型的数据归因非参数方法，通过图像块级相似性衡量训练样本对生成输出的影响，无需模型梯度或重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型归因方法通常需要模型梯度或重训练，这在专有或大规模设置中适用性受限，需要一种完全基于数据的归因方法。

Method: 基于最优得分函数的解析形式，通过图像块级相似性测量生成图像与训练图像之间的影响，支持多尺度表示，并通过基于卷积的加速保持计算效率。

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了强大的归因性能，与基于梯度的方法接近，并显著优于现有非参数基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅产生空间可解释的归因，还揭示了训练数据与输出之间的内在关系，独立于任何特定模型。

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

TL;DR: CAREBench是一个早期事件预测基准测试，评估多模态输入下的预测准确性和时间稳定性，发现现有方法特别是LLMs在准确性和稳定性联合优化方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前早期事件预测系统缺乏对风险评分稳定性的评估，且主要基于表格数据，无法测试风险轨迹行为。需要评估模型在临床决策中的可部署性。

Method: 提出CAREBench基准测试，使用多模态输入（表格EHR、ECG波形、临床文本），引入基于局部Lipschitz常数的稳定性指标来量化短期风险变异性。比较经典学习器、深度序列模型和零样本LLMs在六个预测任务上的表现。

Result: 现有方法特别是LLMs难以同时优化准确性和稳定性，在高精度操作点上的召回率表现较差。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够产生证据对齐的稳定轨迹的模型，以在连续监测环境中赢得临床医生的信任。

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

### [46] [Enhancing Time-Series Anomaly Detection by Integrating Spectral-Residual Bottom-Up Attention with Reservoir Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14287)
*Hayato Nihei,Sou Nobukawa,Yusuke Sakemi,Kazuyuki Aihara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合谱残差方法和储层计算的SR-RC模型，用于提升时间序列异常检测性能，同时保持学习效率，适合边缘AI部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 储层计算虽然简单适合边缘AI，但单独使用时可能需要过大的储层才能达到足够的异常检测性能。注意力机制能提高精度但计算量大，会损害RC的学习效率。

Method: 将谱残差方法（一种无需学习的自底向上注意力机制）与储层计算相结合，提出SR-RC模型。

Result: 在基准任务和真实世界时间序列数据集上，SR-RC优于传统RC和基于SR方法提取值的逻辑回归模型。

Conclusion: 由于SR方法和RC都适合硬件实现，SR-RC为在边缘AI中部署RC进行时间序列异常检测提供了实用方向。

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TED++是一个子流形感知的框架，能有效检测逃避现有防御的隐蔽后门攻击，在自适应攻击和有限数据场景下实现最先进的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络在关键应用中的广泛使用，隐蔽后门攻击（中毒训练输入触发恶意模型行为但看起来正常）构成严重安全风险。现有防御在面对基于距离的微妙异常或干净样本稀缺时容易失效。

Method: TED++围绕每个类的隐藏特征流形构建管状邻域，从少量干净激活估计局部"厚度"，然后应用局部自适应排名(LAR)检测漂移到允许管外的激活。通过聚合所有层的LAR调整排名，捕捉输入在演化类子流形上的忠实程度。

Result: 在基准数据集和任务上的广泛实验表明，TED++在自适应攻击和有限数据场景下实现最先进的检测性能。即使每类只有5个保留样本，TED++仍能实现近乎完美的检测，在AUROC上比次优方法提升高达14%。

Conclusion: TED++通过基于子流形感知的管状邻域构建和局部自适应排名，有效检测隐蔽后门攻击，在有限数据和自适应攻击场景下表现出色。

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy
backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model
behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing
defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies
or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,
a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that
evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood
around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''
from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking
(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By
aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how
faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such
characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose
LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are
conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves
state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and
limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per
class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to
14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/namle-w/TEDpp.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出主动可观测马尔可夫决策过程(AOMDP)，让智能体不仅能选择控制动作，还能决定是否测量潜在状态，以平衡测量成本和状态不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习中测量状态可能成本高昂且对后续结果产生负面影响，需要一种机制来智能地决定何时进行状态测量。

Method: 将AOMDP建模为周期性部分可观测MDP，提出基于信念状态的在线RL算法，并使用序列蒙特卡洛方法近似未知静态环境参数和未观测潜在状态的后验分布。

Result: 在数字健康应用中评估算法，智能体决定何时提供数字干预和何时通过调查评估用户健康状态。

Conclusion: 尽管测量可能带来成本，但减少的不确定性可以显著提高样本效率并增加最优策略的价值。

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

*Shivam Singhal,Eran Malach,Tomaso Poggio,Tomer Galanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-ERM是一个结合LLM引导搜索和ERM验证的程序学习框架，在样本效率和计算可行性上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决程序学习中样本效率和计算可行性的矛盾：传统枚举方法计算成本高，而梯度训练在某些短程序族上需要指数级样本。

Method: 提出LLM-ERM框架：使用预训练推理增强LLM生成k个候选程序，在保留数据上编译验证并选择最佳假设，无需反馈、自适应或梯度。

Result: LLM-ERM仅需200样本即可解决奇偶变体、模式匹配和素数测试等任务，而SGD训练的transformer即使有100,000样本也会过拟合。

Conclusion: 语言引导的程序合成在保持计算可行性的同时恢复了有限类ERM的统计效率，为学习梯度训练无法处理的简洁假设提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

TL;DR: 提出DARTS-GT，通过不对称注意力机制和解耦结构编码与特征表示，结合可微架构搜索在每层选择最优GNN算子，实现深度异质性，并开发首个图变换器定量可解释性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图变换器设计僵化，缺乏可量化可解释性，固定GNN类型无法实现深度特定组件选择，复杂架构难以区分性能提升是来自有意义模式还是伪相关。

Method: 重新设计GT注意力为不对称结构：查询来自节点特征，键值来自GNN变换；使用DARTS在每层选择最优GNN算子；开发因果消融的定量可解释性框架。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，DARTS-GT在4个数据集上达到SOTA，其他保持竞争力；发现架构显示数据集特定模式；可视化注意力显著性与因果重要性不总相关；异质架构产生更可解释模型。

Conclusion: 图变换器无需在性能和可解释性之间取舍，DARTS-GT通过深度异质架构搜索和定量可解释性分析，同时实现了高性能和高可解释性。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出Stop-RAG方法，通过基于价值的控制器自适应决定何时停止检索，解决了迭代RAG系统中固定迭代次数或置信度代理方法效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迭代RAG系统每次额外循环都会增加延迟、成本和引入干扰证据的风险，现有方法要么使用预定迭代次数，要么依赖不能很好反映是否需要更多检索的置信度代理。

Method: 将迭代RAG建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，引入基于价值的控制器Stop-RAG，使用完整轨迹的全宽度前向视图Q(λ)目标进行训练。

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试中，Stop-RAG始终优于固定迭代基线和基于提示的LLM停止方法。

Conclusion: 自适应停止是当前代理系统中的关键缺失组件，基于价值的控制可以显著提高RAG系统的准确性。

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

Motivation: 从微分几何视角重新解释自动微分理论，为深度学习和科学计算开发结构保持的微分方法提供理论基础。

Method: 使用jet bundles和Weil代数的几何框架，将反向模式AD建模为余切拉回，泰勒模式作为Weil代数求值，并引入张量化Weil代数实现混合导数的一步计算。

Result: 获得了反向模式的函子恒等式、高阶导数的代数精确性、截断误差的显式边界，以及避免组合爆炸的线性成本混合导数计算。

Conclusion: 该框架通过微分几何视角解释AD理论，为开发结构保持的微分方法奠定了基础，在深度学习和科学计算中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM系统在日常AI应用中广泛使用，其性能依赖于精心设计的提示。LLM提示优化器通过评分反馈迭代优化提示，但这一优化阶段的安全性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用HarmBench进行系统性分析，提出假奖励攻击方法（无需访问奖励模型），并设计高亮防御机制来减轻攻击影响。

Result: 反馈攻击使攻击成功率提升高达ΔASR=0.48；假奖励攻击将ΔASR从0.23降至0.07，且不影响系统效用。

Conclusion: 提示优化管道是一类重要的攻击面，需要加强对反馈通道和优化框架的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

Motivation: 结合尖峰神经网络（SNNs）的能效优势和状态空间模型（SSMs）在长序列建模中的能力，开发一种适合资源受限应用的乘法自由、稀疏事件驱动的深度学习模型。

Method: 设计第二阶尖峰SSM，利用并行扫描实现动态系统的稳定高效实现，并提出基于核的尖峰回归器，使用共振放电神经元处理超长序列。

Result: 在18k序列上比第二阶基于ANN的SSMs能耗降低73倍，在50k序列上仍能保持优异性能，平均表现优于transformer或第一阶SSMs。

Conclusion: SHaRe-SSM为超长序列建模提供了一种高效节能的解决方案，同时系统分析了共振放电SSM中异质性、耗散和守恒的影响。

Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a
significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their
energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning.
Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

Result: 实验表明，即使在充分预训练和平衡优化后，模型仍然系统性地偏向某些模态，如音频。这种偏差源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异，而非仅由优化动态引起。

Conclusion: 在融合阶段聚合未经校准的模态输出会导致决策层权重偏差，阻碍较弱模态的有效贡献。未来多模态系统应关注在决策层引入自适应权重分配机制，根据各模态能力实现相对平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

Motivation: 现有药物-靶点亲和力预测方法主要关注预测值的准确性，但忽略了交互效应的方向性，这会影响药物分配等决策的质量。

Method: 引入IC-index评估交互方向预测性能，分析预测器对交互效应的捕获能力，并通过实证研究比较多种机器学习算法。

Result: 研究表明，缺乏适当侧信息的等变学习算法无法捕获未见药物或靶点的交互效应，IC-index能有效补充现有评估指标。

Conclusion: IC-index为药物-靶点亲和力预测提供了重要的交互方向评估维度，有助于提升决策质量，特别是在药物分配等应用中。

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

Motivation: MoE技术虽然能有效扩展模型规模，但其巨大的内存开销使得模型压缩成为重要研究方向。现有专家合并方法主要从参数聚合角度理解，本文希望从专家输出合并的新视角进行理论分析。

Method: 提出MergeMoE方法，将专家合并过程解释为在前向计算中插入额外矩阵，并基于此建立优化问题，利用数学优化构建压缩矩阵。

Result: 在多个MoE模型上的评估表明，MergeMoE算法在相同压缩比下始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 从专家输出合并角度理解专家合并技术，并基于数学优化提出的MergeMoE方法能有效压缩MoE模型，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

Motivation: 挑战当前LLM剪枝方法避免完全重训练的主流观点，研究剪枝后权重重构的关键设计选择，探索更高效的性能恢复方法。

Method: 在GPT架构上进行广泛计算研究，比较不同重构粒度的效果，包括单独重构注意力机制和MLP组件、重构整个transformer块等方法。

Result: 发现'免费午餐'场景：逐层单独重构注意力机制和MLP组件是最资源高效且性能最佳的方法，甚至优于完全重训练，同时内存需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: 重构步骤的重要性超过复杂剪枝标准，挑战了'不惜一切代价避免重训练'的叙事，为LLM剪枝后性能恢复提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法难以准确再现地质结构特别是河流沉积物的连续性特征，而过程模型虽然能模拟地质过程但计算成本高昂，因此需要寻找更高效且能保持地质连续性的生成方法。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络（GAN）进行生成建模，通过消融研究验证2D图像生成技术向3D河流沉积物图像的迁移能力，利用过程模型生成训练数据并包含沉积时间等额外属性来监控性能。

Result: GAN训练保持稳定，生成的样本能够再现沉积物的非平稳性和细节特征，没有出现模式崩溃或纯粹记忆训练数据的问题，且能够遵循叠加定律验证地质合理性。

Conclusion: GAN在针对特定地质结构的训练数据集上表现出比预期更强的鲁棒性，利用地质原理如叠加定律来指导深度生成模型具有很大潜力，但在更大3D图像和多模态数据集上的适用性仍需进一步验证。

Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the
variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used
to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated
uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological
structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.
This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of
deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce
fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model
that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments
from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly
transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the
generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits
without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a
process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include
valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the
deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by
checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a
series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given
credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological
structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and
multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models
can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of
promise.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model
accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for
production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a
comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI
Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing
from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized
solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLMs在分子优化中能生成高层次编辑意图，但难以在SMILES等非直观表示上忠实执行修改，需要桥接推理与执行之间的鸿沟。

Method: 采用级联框架：首先生成人类可理解的编辑意图，然后通过代码生成将这些意图转化为可执行的结构编辑。

Result: 在化学反应和靶点特异性化合物对的真实编辑上达到98%以上的准确率，在物化性质和靶点活性优化基准上，一致性提升38-86个百分点至90%+，成功率高于基于SMILES的基线方法。

Conclusion: MECo通过意图与执行的对齐，实现了一致、可控和可解释的分子设计，为药物发现中的高保真反馈循环和人机协作工作流奠定了基础。

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires
precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in
natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文近似(ICA)的数据选择和重加权框架，无需参考模型或额外微调，通过少量精选holdout集的上下文条件来估计候选样本的训练价值，有效提升模型对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前微调大型预训练语言模型时，噪声或偏离目标的样本会稀释监督信号。虽然小型精选数据集往往能与大型数据集性能相当，但系统且高效识别高价值训练数据的方法仍未被充分探索。

Method: 核心是In-Context Approximation(ICA)，通过在少量精选holdout集上进行上下文条件，估计模型在候选样本上训练后的holdout损失。在局部线性化下，ICA等价于向holdout最优解的一阶更新，可作为数据价值的代理。从ICA分数推导每个样本的权重，在模型参数演化时动态重加权梯度更新。

Result: 在SFT、DPO和SimPO等不同方法上，以及多种骨干网络和数据集上，基于ICA的重加权始终能改善模型对齐效果，且开销最小。

Conclusion: ICA框架为数据选择和重加权提供了理论基础和高效实现，能持续提升模型对齐性能，但针对快速漂移的在线策略更新存在局限性，为未来工作指明了方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While
integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to
improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect
predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.
We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide
the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains
statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two
instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and
gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage
high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless
of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented
counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random."
Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with
gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

Motivation: 解决基于价值的强化学习智能体容易产生价值高估和在部分不可逆环境中不稳定的问题，提高决策的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 回滚机制是实现安全和性能提升的关键组件，为安全可靠的顺序决策提供了稳健的方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness
and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing
vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible
environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an
empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and
a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action
estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior
state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term
during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility
awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a
selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly
lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined
threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather
than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids
catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted
rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the
CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8
percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi
v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9
percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while
also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies
confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these
safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable
sequential decision making.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of
Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

<details>

Motivation: 主流Agentic RL算法过度依赖熵信号进行探索，导致训练崩溃问题，需要平衡熵在训练过程中的作用。

Method: AEPO包含两个核心组件：(1)动态熵平衡rollout机制，通过熵预监测自适应分配采样预算，并对连续高熵步骤施加分支惩罚；(2)熵平衡策略优化，在高熵裁剪项中插入停止梯度操作，并采用熵感知优势估计。

Result: 在14个挑战性数据集上，AEPO持续优于7种主流RL算法。Qwen3-14B仅用1K RL样本在GAIA上达到47.6%(Pass@1)和65.0%(Pass@5)，在Humanity's Last Exam上达到11.2%(Pass@1)和26.0%(Pass@5)，在WebWalker上达到43.0%(Pass@1)和70.0%(Pass@5)。

Conclusion: AEPO提高了rollout采样多样性，同时保持策略熵稳定，有助于可扩展的web agent训练。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低精度数据格式要么需要侵入式修改软件框架，要么不够通用。超低位BFP变体由于块中的异常值问题难以提供合理的语言模型性能。

Method: 提出MX+格式，基于关键洞察：异常值不需要使用其元素数据类型中的指数字段，因此可以将指数字段重新用作扩展尾数来提高异常值元素的精度。

Result: MX+在4位精度下相比MXFP4格式显著提高了模型性能，存储开销和速度损失可忽略，为高效LLM推理提供了有吸引力的替代方案。

Conclusion: MX+是一种成本效益高且非侵入式的扩展，可以无缝集成到微缩放格式中，在4位精度下提供比MXFP4或MXFP6更好的性能。

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: RedOUT是一个无监督框架，通过将结构熵集成到图分类的测试时OOD检测中，解决了训练和测试数据分布差异导致的预测不准确问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图OOD检测方法虽然利用数据为中心的技术提取有效表示，但其性能仍受结构冗余导致的语义偏移影响。

Method: 提出冗余感知图信息瓶颈(ReGIB)，将目标分解为基本信息和无关冗余，通过最小化结构熵减少解耦的冗余，并提出理论上的上下界进行优化。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验显示RedOUT在OOD检测上表现优异，在ClinTox/LIPO数据集对上平均提升6.7%，显著超越最佳竞争者17.3%。

Conclusion: RedOUT通过结构熵集成有效解决了图OOD检测中的结构冗余问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用Hydra（一种双向线性时间结构化状态空间模型）替代TabPFN中的Transformer，以解决Transformer在序列长度上的二次复杂度问题，同时通过双向方法减少SSM对输入顺序的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理表格数据时存在序列长度的二次复杂度问题，而状态空间模型（SSM）虽然效率更高，但对输入顺序敏感，这在行顺序无语义意义的表格数据中是不希望的。

Method: 使用Hydra双向线性时间结构化状态空间模型替代TabPFN中的Transformer，通过双向方法实现对称上下文聚合，减少对输入顺序的依赖。

Result: 该方法有效降低了顺序依赖性，预测性能与原TabPFN模型相当。

Conclusion: Hydra SSM作为Transformer的替代方案，在保持效率的同时减少了顺序敏感性，为表格数据的基础模型提供了有前景的替代架构。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for tabular data, such as TabPFN,
demonstrated that pretrained Transformer architectures can approximate Bayesian
inference with high predictive performance. However, Transformers suffer from
quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, motivating the
exploration of more efficient sequence models. In this work, we investigate the
potential of using Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space
model (SSM), as an alternative to Transformers in TabPFN. A key challenge lies
in SSM's inherent sensitivity to the order of input tokens - an undesirable
property for tabular datasets where the row order is semantically meaningless.
We investigate to what extent a bidirectional approach can preserve efficiency
and enable symmetric context aggregation. Our experiments show that this
approach reduces the order-dependence, achieving predictive performance
competitive to the original TabPFN model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Conformal Labeling的新方法，通过控制AI标注子集中的错误发现率(FDR)，为AI预测提供可证明的信任保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型在数据标注中存在的标签质量问题，现有选择性标注方法缺乏对AI标注质量的保证，导致AI标注子集中错误率过高。

Method: 为每个测试实例构建符合性p值，通过比较AI模型的预测置信度与校准实例中被AI错误标注的置信度，选择p值低于数据依赖阈值的实例，证明AI预测可信。

Result: 实验表明该方法在图像和文本标注、LLM问答等任务中实现了严格的FDR控制和高效率。

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling方法能够确保AI标注子集中预定义比例的标签正确，为AI辅助数据标注提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

Result: 在Astex和PDBbind测试集上表现出优异的对接成功率和物理合理性，比现代大规模共折叠模型快约25倍。

Conclusion: Matcha提供了一个高效、准确的蛋白质-配体对接解决方案，在速度和精度方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for
structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed,
accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular
docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring
and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential
stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as
a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces
($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the
prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

Motivation: 当前的RAG系统主要处理单模态文本数据，在处理包含文本、图像、表格、方程和图形的非结构化多模态文档时效果有限。

Method: MAHA结合稠密向量检索和结构化图遍历，使用知识图谱编码跨模态语义和关系，实现语义丰富且上下文感知的多模态检索。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的评估显示，MAHA显著优于基线方法，ROUGE-L得分达到0.486，并提供完整的模态覆盖。

Conclusion: MAHA建立了一个可扩展且可解释的检索框架，通过结合嵌入和显式文档结构，实现了对非结构化多模态数据的模态感知推理，推动了RAG系统的发展。

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal
documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and
graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a
Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for
multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge
graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal,
where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling
effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and
interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling
modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.

TL;DR: 提出了FAL和FAL+两种高效的Transformer架构，通过重定向第一层MHA输出到后续层的MLP输入，消除了每块的MHA-MLP连接，显著减少了通信开销和训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer设计在张量并行训练中存在显著的通信开销，特别是每个块的MHA-MLP连接需要all-reduce通信。研究发现MHA-MLP连接可以绕过以提高效率。

Method: FAL将第一层MHA输出重定向到后续层的MLP输入，消除每块的MHA-MLP连接；FAL+在此基础上将归一化的第一注意力输出添加到后续层MHA输出中，以增强MLP输入质量。

Result: FAL将多GPU训练时间减少高达44%，单GPU吞吐量提升1.18倍，困惑度优于基线GPT；FAL+在不增加训练时间的情况下实现更低的困惑度。

Conclusion: FAL和FAL+通过重新设计Transformer架构，有效解决了分布式训练中的通信瓶颈问题，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing
multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a
standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性，能够增强科学知识发现和非专家可解释性，为高风险领域提供更可靠的反事实解释能力。

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

data giving rise to machine learning-based approaches. Unfortunately, most of

Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain
adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align
low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an
embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled
alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

Result: 在MNIST、FMNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，FedPPA优于现有FL算法，在个性化适应方面表现优异

Conclusion: FedPPA有效解决了联邦学习中的模型和数据异构性问题，提升了个性化鲁棒性和全局模型性能

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

Motivation: 现代GPU的专用硬件单元支持高性能异步数据流执行，但传统的SIMT编程模型与任务并行硬件不匹配，导致程序开发复杂且容易出错。

Method: 提出Tawa编译器，使用新颖的异步引用IR抽象来表达warp级通信，自动划分生产者-消费者角色并管理复杂的数据流管道。

Result: 在NVIDIA H100 GPU上，Tawa在LLM内核中实现高硬件利用率，相比cuBLAS GEMM内核提速1.1倍，注意力工作负载比Triton提速1.2倍，性能与手工优化的CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3相当。

Conclusion: Tawa通过自动化warp专业化代码生成，显著降低了GPU数据流编程的复杂性，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

Conclusion: INDAGO-Nexus通过多目标优化方法显著提高了测试效果，能够发现更多样化的故障场景并加速故障检测。

Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains
requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO
rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure
counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal
distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search
approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario
diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity
metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on
three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On
average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test
effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively,
while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

Conclusion: FSP通过预测长期未来的紧凑表示，有效提升了语言模型的长程推理能力，为长文本生成提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models

Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting
several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies
and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),
which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the
long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We
explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words
summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use
embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.
Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate
that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,
and coding benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating causal directed acyclic graphs
in linear non-Gaussian acyclic models with latent confounders (LvLiNGAM).
Existing methods assume mutually independent latent confounders or cannot
properly handle models with causal relationships among observed variables.
  We propose a novel algorithm that identifies causal DAGs in LvLiNGAM,
allowing causal structures among latent variables, among observed variables,
and between the two. The proposed method leverages higher-order cumulants of
observed data to identify the causal structure. Extensive simulations and
experiments with real-world data demonstrate the validity and practical utility
of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: We propose an active jammer localization framework that combines Bayesian
optimization with acquisition-aware path planning. Unlike passive crowdsourced
methods, our approach adaptively guides a mobile agent to collect high-utility
Received Signal Strength measurements while accounting for urban obstacles and
mobility constraints. For this, we modified the A* algorithm, A-UCB*, by
incorporating acquisition values into trajectory costs, leading to
high-acquisition planned paths. Simulations on realistic urban scenarios show
that the proposed method achieves accurate localization with fewer measurements
compared to uninformed baselines, demonstrating consistent performance under
different environments.

Motivation: 研究真实数据集上核回归的学习曲线预测问题，旨在建立从数据集结构到模型性能的端到端理论框架。

Method: 提出HEA方法，通过数据协方差矩阵和目标函数的多项式分解来近似核的特征值和特征函数，从而预测学习曲线。

Conclusion: HEA框架证明了在真实数据集上为复杂学习算法建立从数据集结构到模型性能的端到端理论是可行的。

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Hebbian学习在机器学习中存在连接更新不受约束和缺乏反馈调节的问题，限制了其在复杂网络架构和任务中的有效扩展。

Method: SPHeRe通过局部辅助非线性块整合正交性和结构信息保留，结构信息保留损失通过轻量级投影反向传播作为反馈调节，正交性约束确保更新幅度的有界性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet等标准图像分类基准测试中达到无监督突触可塑性方法的最先进性能，在持续学习和迁移学习场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了Hebbian无监督学习规则在现代深度学习框架中的竞争力和潜力，展示了不严格依赖反向传播的高效生物启发学习算法的可能性。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how
neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied
to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates
of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such
shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and
tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian
Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates
orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary
nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation
backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that
conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints
account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental
results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic
plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong
effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image
reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted
features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian
unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,
demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning
algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/SPHeRe.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在无导师情况下处理无界奖励的谨慎学习算法，通过选择可信区域和仅在证据证明无害时执行任务，在高风险AI应用中实现安全探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键AI应用中，单次错误可能导致不可逆损害。现有序列决策理论假设所有错误都可恢复，但实际中奖励可能无界负值。虽然有导师辅助的方法，但导师不一定总是可用。

Method: 将问题建模为带弃权选项的双动作上下文赌博机：智能体观察输入后选择弃权（固定0奖励）或执行任务（奖励有上界但可任意负值）。提出基于谨慎的算法，学习何时不学习，仅在没有证据证明有害时执行任务。

Result: 在独立同分布输入条件下，建立了次线性遗憾保证，理论上证明了谨慎探索在高风险环境中部署学习智能体的有效性。

Conclusion: 谨慎探索策略能够在无导师情况下安全部署学习智能体，避免不可逆损害，同时保证学习性能。

Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable
damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that
all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit
algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this
assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help
from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we
formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a
two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent
observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit
(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are
upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed
Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when
not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available
evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.
inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating
the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely
in high-stakes environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合结构稀疏性和学习排列的稀疏训练方法PA-DST，在保持高精度的同时显著提升训练和推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏性在现代GPU上能加速训练和推理，但在准确率上仍落后于非结构化动态稀疏训练，主要原因是表达能力受限

Method: 为每个层学习单个排列矩阵与结构化权重矩阵联合训练，应用于块、N:M和对角线三种典型结构

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和WikiText-103上，PA-DST在90-95%稀疏度下匹配非结构化基线准确率，训练速度提升1.21倍，推理速度提升2.9倍

Conclusion: 结构+学习排列的组合在准确率和效率之间找到了最佳平衡点

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

Method: 提出了一种基于马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛技术的简单迭代采样算法，利用基础模型自身的似然性。

Result: 在MATH500、HumanEval和GPQA等单次任务上，该算法显著提升了推理能力，性能接近甚至超过RL后训练，同时避免了多样性崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、精选数据集或验证器，在不可验证领域具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Method: 提出ShifTS框架：1）使用软注意力机制从回看和预测时间序列中寻找不变模式；2）首先处理时间偏移，然后解决概念漂移；3）框架与具体方法无关，可应用于多种模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，ShifTS能够持续提升多种无关模型的预测准确性，在多个数据集上优于现有的概念漂移、时间偏移以及组合基线方法。

Conclusion: ShifTS框架通过统一处理时间偏移和概念漂移，有效解决了时间序列预测中的分布偏移问题，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

Motivation: 现有可解释性方法依赖人工检查且局限于简单任务，自动化方法又容易忽略特征间交互并依赖外部LLM和数据集质量。需要更系统化的电路分析方法。

Method: WeightLens直接从学习到的权重解释特征，无需解释模型或数据集；CircuitLens捕捉特征激活如何从组件交互中产生，揭示电路级动态。

Result: WeightLens在上下文无关特征上匹配或超越现有方法性能；CircuitLens能够识别仅基于激活的方法无法发现的电路级动态。

Conclusion: 这两种方法提高了可解释性的鲁棒性，增强了电路的可扩展机制分析，同时保持了效率和质量。

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

Conclusion: LeaPR提供了一个灵活的学习范式，能够端到端学习可解释的表征，特征和预测结果都可以被直接检查和理解。

Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are
efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent
on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn
useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this
comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware
to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call
Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary
features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and
decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a
remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We
propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we
design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly
generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3
algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on
demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation
to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural
network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work
suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations
end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and
understood.

Motivation: 解决少步扩散或流模型蒸馏中存在的格式不匹配问题，这些复杂蒸馏过程往往导致质量与多样性之间的权衡

Method: 修改学生流模型的输出层，预测无网络策略，在时间步生成动态流速度，通过模仿蒸馏方法匹配教师模型的行为

Result: 在ImageNet 256²上达到1-NFE FID 2.85，优于相同DiT架构的MeanFlow；在FLUX.1-12B和Qwen-Image-20B上，4 NFE时比最先进方法获得更好的多样性，同时保持教师级质量

Conclusion: π-Flow通过简单模仿教师行为实现稳定可扩展训练，避免了质量-多样性权衡，在少步生成任务中表现出色

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

Conclusion: 虽然SSMs在理论上存在长序列生成的局限性，但通过工具增强可以克服这些限制，使SSMs成为交互式工具和智能体设置中Transformer的高效替代方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers
for sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context
and long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of
computational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical
result stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form''
generation problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main
competitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated
by allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that
given the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs
can learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem
length/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our
theoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable
length generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.
These findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to
Transformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT)
networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models,
addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical
analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse
the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.
Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we
quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies
these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a
new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}
unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks
with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies
this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained
solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs
successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic
Gaussian-mixture setting.

*Amel Abdelraheem,Alessandro Favero,Gerome Bovet,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的后门攻击消除方法，利用后门在模型权重空间中的解耦特性，通过简单的反学习方法有效移除后门，同时保持模型在正常任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型虽然实现了广泛的泛化能力，但对对抗性扰动和后门攻击高度敏感。现有后门移除方法需要昂贵的微调，且会降低模型在其他任务上的性能。本文旨在研究是否能在不影响模型通用能力的前提下移除后门。

Method: 研究发现后门在模型权重空间中与其他良性任务是解耦的。基于这一发现，提出了一种简单的反学习方法，通过分离和擦除后门的影响来实现后门消除。该方法在已知攻击信息时直接使用，在未知攻击时通过反向工程估计触发器。

Result: 在CLIP基础模型和常见对抗性触发器的实验中，该方法在已知攻击信息时实现了近乎完美的后门消除，同时平均保持96%的干净准确率。即使在攻击未知的情况下，也能通过反向工程触发器成功消除后门。

Conclusion: 该方法相比现有最先进的防御方法，始终能够提供更好的后门消除与干净准确率的权衡，证明了后门解耦特性在模型安全防御中的有效性。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型原理的新采样器，用于加速循环深度语言模型的生成，在相同时间预算下比自回归生成更具表达力，可实现高达5倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索循环深度模型与扩散语言模型之间的关系，利用它们的相似性来加速模型生成过程。

Method: 开发了一种扩散强制采样器，在每个前向传递中解码新token，同时通过循环并行优化这些token的潜在状态。

Result: 该采样器可直接应用于现有的35亿参数循环深度transformer，无需调优即可实现高达5倍的加速。

Conclusion: 不仅为循环深度模型在推理时的高效并行计算提供了机制，还表明此类模型可自然视为强大的连续（尽管是因果的）扩散语言模型。

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

*Zachary Robertson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用恒等链接函数而非传统的logit/probit链接来构建IRT模型，以保持TVD-MI成对比较数据的加性结构，实现更高效的大语言模型评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的IRT模型使用非线性链接函数（如logit、probit）会破坏TVD-MI成对比较数据的加性结构，导致模型拟合偏差。

Method: 从Gini熵最大化推导出裁剪线性模型，采用盒约束最小二乘公式处理边界饱和问题，使用恒等链接函数保持数据的加性结构。

Result: 在33%覆盖率下，获得保持集RMSE为0.117±0.008，同时保持代理排名一致性（Spearman ρ=0.972±0.015），比全密集评估减少三倍计算量。

Conclusion: TVD-MI的几何结构最适合通过恒等映射来保持，这种方法可高效评估大语言模型，并适用于其他有界响应领域。

Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance
mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show
that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with
additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear
link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we
find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks
additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw
data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce
substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We
derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a
box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At
33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent
rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations
than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows
strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent
identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity
mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response
domains.

*Katiana Kontolati,Rini Jasmine Gladstone,Ian Davis,Ethan Pickering*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文扩展了生物信息神经网络(BINNs)在作物基因组预测和选择中的应用，通过整合数千个SNP、多组学数据和先验生物知识，显著提高了预测准确性，特别是在稀疏数据条件下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因型到表型(G2P)模型依赖直接映射，准确性有限，育种者需进行大规模昂贵的田间试验。现有模型虽然能利用中间分子表型提高预测拟合度，但在基因组选择时这些数据不可用。BINNs旨在克服这一限制。

Method: BINNs通过编码通路级归纳偏置，在训练时利用多组学数据，在推理时仅使用基因型数据。该方法应用于玉米基因表达和多环境田间试验数据，并在合成代谢组学基准测试中验证。

Result: 在稀疏数据条件下，BINN将排序相关准确性提高了56%，非线性识别了GWAS/TWAS未能发现的基因。在合成基准测试中，相对于传统神经网络将预测误差降低了75%，并正确识别了最重要的非线性通路。

Conclusion: BINNs建立了一个框架，利用中间领域信息提高基因组预测准确性，揭示非线性生物关系，可指导基因组选择、候选基因选择、通路富集和基因编辑优先级排序。

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

TL;DR: 提出DeepMartingale方法，使用鞅表示和深度学习解决连续时间离散监测最优停止问题的对偶性，在高维情况下提供紧上界且无维度灾难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维最优停止问题的对偶性分析，传统方法面临维度灾难，需要新的深度学习方法来提供紧上界并保证收敛性。

Method: 基于鞅表示理论，设计深度神经网络架构DeepMartingale，通过离散监测方式处理连续时间最优停止问题。

Result: 证明了DeepMartingale的上界收敛性，网络规模与维度D无关，仅与精度ε相关，避免了维度灾难。数值实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepMartingale为高维最优停止问题提供了有效的对偶分析方法，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Using a martingale representation, we introduce a novel deep-learning
approach, which we call DeepMartingale, to study the duality of
discrete-monitoring optimal stopping problems in continuous time. This approach
provides a tight upper bound for the primal value function, even in
high-dimensional settings. We prove that the upper bound derived from
DeepMartingale converges under very mild assumptions. Even more importantly, we
establish the expressivity of DeepMartingale: it approximates the true value
function within any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$ under our architectural
design of neural networks whose size is bounded by
$\tilde{c}\,D^{\tilde{q}}\varepsilon^{-\tilde{r}}$, where the constants
$\tilde{c}, \tilde{q}, \tilde{r}$ are independent of the dimension $D$ and the
accuracy $\varepsilon$. This guarantees that DeepMartingale does not suffer
from the curse of dimensionality. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
practical effectiveness of DeepMartingale, confirming its convergence,
expressivity, and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肾脏交换项目中HLA兼容性表达范式从抗原发展到等位基因和表位，需要评估这些变化对移植效果和种族公平性的影响。

Method: 比较三种HLA兼容性范式（抗原、等位基因、表位）在肾脏交换项目中的效果，分析种族不平等问题，并提出基于公平性加权的优化模型。

Result: 从抗原向等位基因和表位范式转变可能扩大种族不平等，但提出的公平性加权模型能在不牺牲移植机会的前提下缓解这些不平等。

Conclusion: HLA兼容性范式的进步需要关注公平性影响，公平性加权模型能有效解决种族不平等问题，同时保持移植机会。

Abstract: Kidney Exchange Programs (KEPs) promote access to living donor trans-
plantation for patients suffering from end stage renal disease. The HLA
compatibility between transplant recipients and donors plays an important role
when solving the matching problems occuring in KEPs. Compatibility defines the
feasible solution space and often occurs in a weighted form in the objective
function. Recently, the paradigms used to express HLA com- patibility have
advanced substantially from antigens to alleles and eplets. We show how KEP
effectiveness and equity vary with these three paradigms. The equity analysis
focuses on ethnic inequities and the result confirm that moving from antigen to
allele and eplet paradigms may enlarge inequities. We present new optimization
models based on equity weighting that rem- edy ethnic inequities for all three
paradigms without sacrificing access to transplant.

Abstract: We prove that (local) input-to-state stability ((L)ISS) and integral
input-to-state stability (iISS) of time-varying infinite-dimensional systems in

function. In particular, input-to-state stability of linear time-varying
control systems in Hilbert spaces with bounded input operators is discussed.
Methods for the construction of non-coercive LISS/iISS Lyapunov functions are
presented for a certain class of time-varying semi-linear evolution equations.

Conclusion: MiSSOC通过数据驱动和知识驱动的代理建模，是解决复杂MINLP问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making processes rely on solving mixed-integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. However, finding high-quality solutions
to MINLPs is often computationally demanding. This has motivated the
development of specialized algorithms that take advantage of the structure of
some MINLPs to improve their tractability. In this work, we propose the
Mixed-integer Smoothing Surrogate Optimization with Constraints (MiSSOC)
approach, a novel optimization algorithm that builds and solves surrogate
problems for complex MINLPs which are more tractable in practice. MiSSOC
integrates statistical modeling into mathematical optimization by approximating
complex functions in an MINLP using smooth additive regression models with
$B-$splines. Expert knowledge can be incorporated into the building phase of
the approximating functions through shape constraints related to sign (or
bounds), monotonicity and convexity over the observed domain. Thus, MiSSOC
fills a gap in the literature by building surrogates that are both data-driven
and knowledge-driven. The surrogate problem is formulated by replacing the
original complex functions with their approximations. The proposed MiSSOC
algorithm is evaluated through a set of experiments, including benchmark
instances and a real-world case study. MiSSOC is tested with different
state-of-the-art solvers and with the tailored Sequential Convex MINLP
(SC-MINLP) algorithm. The latter exploits the separable structure of the
surrogate functions, which results from the approximating functions being sums
of piecewise univariate polynomials. MiSSOC is benchmarked against solving the
original MINLPs directly. The results show that MiSSOC is an effective approach
for addressing complex MINLPs through surrogate modeling, particularly when
used in combination with the SC-MINLP algorithm.

Motivation: 自然灾害导致电网大面积停电，传统恢复方法响应时间长。利用电动校车的大容量电池和部署准备度，可以为关键负载提供更快的电力恢复。

Method: 提出混合整数规划模型，考虑ESB的运输和能量调度、多次往返行程、多ESB路径空间耦合等实际因素。开发了精确分支定价算法和启发式分支定价算法。

Result: 在圣安东尼奥真实案例中，精确B&P算法比Gurobi快121倍，启发式B&P算法快335倍。网络稀疏性限制使恢复成本平均增加207%，但ESB容量利用率可达有效容量的4.5倍。

Conclusion: 提出的ESB路由和调度方法能够高效利用电动校车资源，在灾害期间快速恢复关键负载电力，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Natural disasters threaten the resilience of power systems, causing
widespread power outages that disrupt critical loads (e.g., hospitals) and
endanger public safety. Compared to the conventional restoration methods that
often have long response times, leveraging government-controlled electric
school buses (ESBs) with large battery capacity and deployment readiness offers
a promising solution for faster power restoration to critical loads during
disasters while traditional maintenance is underway. Therefore, we study the
problem of routing and scheduling a heterogeneous fleet of ESBs to satisfy the
energy demand of critical isolated loads around disasters addressing the
following practical aspects: combined transportation and energy scheduling of
ESBs, multiple back-and-forth trips of ESBs between isolated loads and charging
stations, and spatial-wise coupling among multiple ESB routes. We propose an
efficient mixed-integer programming model for routing and scheduling ESBs,
accounting for the practical aspects, to minimize the total restoration cost
over a planning horizon. We develop an efficient exact branch-and-price (B&P)
algorithm and a customized heuristic B&P algorithm integrating dynamic
programming and labeling algorithms. Numerical results based on a real case
study of San Antonio disaster shelters and critical facilities demonstrate that
our proposed exact B&P and heuristic B&P algorithms are computationally 121 and
335 times faster, respectively, than Gurobi. Using network sparsity to
incorporate the limitation in shelter-ESB type compatibility in the model
demonstrates that the total restoration cost increases, on average, by 207% as
the network becomes fully sparse compared to fully connected. The capacity
utilization metric reflects that the proposed practical ESB routing and
scheduling enables an ESB to meet the energy demand 4.5 times its effective
usable capacity.

Abstract: Simulation-based optimization of complex systems over discrete decision
spaces is a challenging computational problem. Specifically, discrete decision
spaces lead to a combinatorial explosion of possible alternatives, making it
computationally prohibitive to perform simulations for all possible
combinations. In this work, we present a new approach to handle these issues by
transforming/projecting the discrete decision space into a continuous latent
space using a probabilistic model know as Variational AutoEncoders. The
transformation of the decision space facilitates the implementation of Bayesian
optimization (BO), which is an efficient approach that strategically navigates
the space to reduce the number of expensive simulations. Here, the key
observation is that points in the latent space correspond to decisions in the
original mixed-discrete space, but the latent space is much easier to navigate
using BO. We illustrate the benefits of our approach through a couple of case
studies that aim to design complex distillation systems: the recovery of
caprylic acid from water by liquid-liquid extraction and the separation of an
azeotropic mixture using a thermally couple column know as extractive dividing
wall column.

Conclusion: 领域无关动态规划可以作为有效的通用定价求解器，在分支定价算法中实现高性能。

Abstract: Column generation and branch-and-price are leading methods for large-scale
exact optimization. Column generation iterates between solving a master problem
and a pricing problem. The master problem is a linear program, which can be
solved using a generic solver. The pricing problem is highly dependent on the
application but is usually discrete. Due to the difficulty of discrete
optimization, high-performance column generation often relies on a custom
pricing algorithm built specifically to exploit the problem's structure. This
bespoke nature of the pricing solver prevents the reuse of components for other
applications. We show that domain-independent dynamic programming, a software
package for modeling and solving arbitrary dynamic programs, can be used as a
generic pricing solver. We develop basic implementations of branch-and-price
with pricing by domain-independent dynamic programming and show that they
outperform a world-leading solver on static mixed integer programming
formulations for seven problem classes.

Abstract: Renewable generators must commit to day-ahead market bids despite uncertainty
in both production and real-time prices. While forecasts provide valuable
guidance, rare and unpredictable extreme events (so-called black swans) can
cause substantial financial losses. This paper models the nomination problem as
an instance of optimal transport-based distributionally robust optimization
(OT-DRO), a principled framework that balances risk and performance by
accounting not only for the severity of deviations but also for their
likelihood. The resulting formulation yields a tractable, data-driven strategy
that remains competitive under normal conditions while providing effective
protection against extreme price spikes. Using four years of Finnish wind farm
and market data, we demonstrate that OT-DRO consistently outperforms
forecast-based nominations and significantly mitigates losses during black swan
events.

Abstract: We study the Order-$k$ ($k \geq 4$) spiked tensor model for the tensor
principal component analysis (PCA) problem: given $N$ i.i.d. observations of a
$k$-th order tensor generated from the model $\mathbf{T} = \lambda \cdot
v_*^{\otimes k} + \mathbf{E}$, where $\lambda > 0$ is the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), $v_*$ is a unit vector, and $\mathbf{E}$ is a random noise tensor, the
goal is to recover the planted vector $v_*$.
  We propose a normalized stochastic gradient ascent (NSGA) method with
overparameterization for solving the tensor PCA problem. Without any global (or
spectral) initialization step, the proposed algorithm successfully recovers the
signal $v_*$ when $N\lambda^2 \geq \widetilde{\Omega}(d^{\lceil k/2 \rceil})$,
thereby breaking the previous conjecture that (stochastic) gradient methods
require at least $\Omega(d^{k-1})$ samples for recovery. For even $k$, the
$\widetilde{\Omega}(d^{k/2})$ threshold coincides with the optimal threshold
under computational constraints, attained by sum-of-squares relaxations and
related algorithms. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the
overparameterized stochastic gradient method not only establishes a significant
initial optimization advantage during the early learning phase but also
achieves strong generalization guarantees. This work provides the first
evidence that overparameterization improves statistical performance relative to

### [111] [Recursive Target Body Approach for Low-Thrust Multiple Gravity-Assist Sequence Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14402)
*Sean Cowan,Ron Noomen*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为递归目标体方法(RTBA)的新优化方法，用于自动化设计使用低推力推进的行星间多重力辅助转移轨迹，通过树搜索方法和并行化技术显著提高了优化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在空间任务的初步设计阶段，多重力辅助序列的组合复杂性非常高，现有的优化方法需要大量经验且模拟时间长达数天，因此需要开发自动化优化方法。

Method: 使用递归目标体方法(RTBA)，结合hodographic-shaping低推力轨迹表示和树搜索方法，通过递归评估后续重力辅助目标的最优性来逐步构建最优MGA序列，并采用广义岛模型(GIM)进行并行化处理。

Result: 在地球-木星转移任务中，RTBA在21.5小时内找到了最优的EMJ转移序列，ΔV为15.4 km/s，通过大量调优显著提高了MGA轨迹质量，确保鲁棒的低推力轨迹优化。

Conclusion: RTBA方法可以自动可靠地用于低推力MGA轨迹的初步优化，能够一致地找到高度适合的MGA序列组，供更高精度方法进一步使用。

Abstract: This work aims to automate the design of Multiple Gravity-Assist (MGA)
transfers between planets using low-thrust propulsion. In particular, during
the preliminary design phase of space missions, the combinatorial complexity of
MGA sequencing is very large, and current optimization approaches require
extensive experience and can take many days to simulate. Therefore, a novel
optimization approach is developed here -- called the Recursive Target Body
Approach (RTBA) -- that uses the hodographic-shaping low-thrust trajectory
representation together with a unique combination of tree-search methods to
automate the optimization of MGA sequences. The approach gradually constructs
the optimal MGA sequence by recursively evaluating the optimality of subsequent
gravity-assist targets. Another significant contribution to the novelty of this
work is the use of parallelization in an original way involving the Generalized
Island Model (GIM) that enables the use of new figures of merit to further
increase the robustness and accelerate the convergence. An Earth-Jupiter
transfer with a maximum of three gravity assists is considered as a reference
problem. The RTBA takes 21.5 hours to find an EMJ transfer with 15.4 km/s
$\Delta V$ to be the optimum. Extensive tuning improved the quality of the MGA
trajectories substantially, and as a result a robust low-thrust trajectory
optimization could be ensured. A distinct group of highly fit MGA sequences is
consistently found that can be passed on to a higher-fidelity method. In
conclusion, the RTBA can automatically and reliably be used for the preliminary
optimization of low-thrust MGA trajectories.

*Thomas Klatzer,David Cardona-Vasquez,Luca Santosuosso,Sonja Wogrin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个能够对包含储能时间耦合约束的电力系统模型进行精确时间序列聚合的方法，利用主动约束集和对偶信息，相比现有方法能保证解精度且无需迭代确定代表性时段数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列聚合方法通常无法保证解精度，或需要迭代过程来确定所需的代表性时段数量，这限制了其在电力系统优化中的实际应用。

Method: 利用主动约束集和对偶信息实现精确时间序列聚合，并采用机器学习方法（分类和聚类）来指导包含可变可再生能源和储能协同调度的模型中的聚合过程。

Result: 数值结果表明，相对于完整规模模型，该方法显著提高了计算性能，同时保持了高解精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论上实现了精确时间序列聚合，并通过机器学习方法将其成功应用于实际电力系统优化问题，为包含储能和可再生能源的复杂系统建模提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Time series aggregation (TSA) methods aim to construct temporally aggregated
optimization models that accurately represent the output space of their
full-scale counterparts while using a significantly reduced dimensionality in
the input space. This paper presents the first approach that achieves an exact
TSA of a full-scale power system model -- even in the presence of energy
storage time-coupling constraints -- by leveraging active constraint sets and
dual information. This advances the state of the art beyond existing TSA
approaches, which typically cannot guarantee solution accuracy or rely on
iterative procedures to determine the required number of representative
periods. To bridge the gap between our theoretical analysis and their practical
application, we employ machine learning approaches, i.e., classification and
clustering, to inform TSA in models that co-schedule variable renewable energy
sources and energy storage. Numerical results demonstrate substantially
improved computational performance relative to the full-scale model, while
maintaining high solution accuracy.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文研究线性二次最优控制问题中控制和状态变量的联合降维方法，针对时间变化抛物型偏微分方程，提出结合控制和状态空间降维的自适应算法，并证明其收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法主要关注状态空间降维，但最优控制问题的一阶最优性条件自然导致控制变量的降维结构。因此需要研究控制和状态变量的联合降维方法，以提高计算效率。

Method: 提出控制和状态联合降维的问题形式，该形式与仅状态降维问题具有相同的最小化解。提供最优控制的后验误差上下界和最优函数值误差表示，并基于这些误差界设计自适应算法。

Result: 证明了自适应算法的收敛性，数值实验表明控制和状态空间联合降维相比仅状态降维具有明显优势。

Conclusion: 控制和状态变量的联合降维方法在保证精度的同时显著提高了计算效率，自适应算法能够有效控制误差，为线性二次最优控制问题提供了高效的数值求解方案。

Abstract: We consider linear model reduction in both the control and state variables
for unconstrained linear-quadratic optimal control problems subject to
time-varying parabolic PDEs. The first-order optimality condition for a
state-space reduced model naturally leads to a reduced structure of the optimal
control. Thus, we consider a control- and state-reduced problem that admits the
same minimizer as the solely state-reduced problem. Lower and upper \emph{a
posteriori} error bounds for the optimal control and a representation for the
error in the optimal function value are provided. These bounds are used in an
adaptive algorithm to solve the control problem. We prove its convergence and
numerically demonstrate the advantage of combined control and state space
reduction.

TL;DR: 将流匹配扩展到线性系统集合，在确定性和随机性设置下处理非马尔可夫插值问题，提出了控制律的表征和数值实现方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展流匹配方法以处理线性系统集合，解决由系统参数平均引起的记忆效应和非马尔可夫插值问题。

Method: 在随机设置中，通过条件期望表征Volterra型控制；在确定性设置中，采用开环表征。使用循环网络处理历史依赖，前馈网络学习时变增益。

Result: 推导了特定分布下条件期望的显式形式，提出了控制输入逼近的数值程序，实现了随机和确定性两种机制之间的数值分离。

Conclusion: 随机情况下历史依赖至关重要，确定性情况下需要先建立确定性样本配对，学习简化为低维时间回归问题。

Abstract: We extend flow matching to ensembles of linear systems in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. Averaging over system parameters induces memory
leading to a non-Markovian interpolation problem for the stochastic case. In
this setting, a control law that achieves the distributional controllability is
characterized as the conditional expectation of a Volterra-type control. This
conditional expectation in the stochastic settings motivates an open-loop
characterization in the noiseless-deterministic setting. Explicit forms of the
conditional expectations are derived for special cases of the given
distributions and a practical numerical procedure is presented to approximate
the control inputs. A by-product of our analysis is a numerical split between
the two regimes. For the stochastic case, history dependence is essential and
we implement the conditional expectation with a recurrent network trained using
independent sampling. For the deterministic case, the flow is memoryless and a
feedforward network learns a time-varying gain that transports the ensemble. We
show that to realize the full target distribution in this deterministic
setting, one must first establish a deterministic sample pairing (e.g.,
optimal-transport or Schrodinger-bridge coupling), after which learning reduces
to a low-dimensional regression in time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI图像分割在医学应用中至关重要，但强度不均匀性、噪声和伪影等挑战使分割过程复杂化。

Result: 数值测试表明该框架在噪声脑部分割中表现优异，从定性和定量角度均优于类似方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于卡通-纹理演化的框架能有效处理MRI图像分割中的噪声和偏置问题，为医学图像分析提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is essential for noninvasive generation of
high-quality images of human tissues. Accurate segmentation of MRI data is
critical for medical applications like brain anatomy analysis and disease
detection. However, challenges such as intensity inhomogeneity, noise, and
artifacts complicate this process. To address these issues, we propose a
three-step framework exploiting the idea of Cartoon-Texture evolution to
produce a denoised and debiased MR image. The first step involves identifying
statistical information about the nature of the noise using a suitable image
decomposition. In the second step, a multiplicative intrinsic component model
is applied to a smother version of the image, simultaneously reconstructing the
bias and removing noise using noise information from the previous step. At the
final step, standard clustering techniques are used to create an accurate
segmentation. Additionally, we present a convergence analysis of the ADMM
scheme for solving the nonlinear optimization problem with multiaffine
constraints resulting from the second step. Numerical tests demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework, especially in noisy brain segmentation, both
from a qualitative and a quantitative viewpoint, compared to similar methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种混合动态系统方法来建模异质多车道交通流，包含两类人工驾驶车辆（轿车和卡车）和自动驾驶车辆，研究了微观和介观层面的最优控制问题，并通过Γ-收敛证明了平均场极限下最优控制解的存在性。

Abstract: Modeling heterogeneous and multi-lane traffic flow is essential for
understanding and controlling complex transportation systems. In this work, we
consider three vehicle populations: two classes of human-driven vehicles (cars
and trucks) and autonomous vehicles, the latter characterized by controlled
acceleration. Compared to single-population models, multi-population modeling
poses greater challenges, primarily due to the increased number of parameters
required to describe lane-changing behavior and the added complexity in passing
to the mean-field limit. We model multi-lane traffic as a hybrid dynamical
system, combining continuous dynamics within each lane and discrete events
corresponding to lane-changing maneuvers. We then formulate and analyze the
optimal control problem associated with such hybrid systems from both
microscopic and mesoscopic perspectives. Using techniques from
$\Gamma$-convergence, we prove the existence of solutions to the optimal
control problem in the mean-field limit of a finite-dimensional hybrid system.
Finally, we present numerical simulations illustrating the impact of trucks on
overall traffic efficiency.

Method: 采用基于隐函数定理的全局简化策略，计算所有准则的共同简化下降方向，通过求解简单凸规划获得，并设计Armijo型线搜索条件确保可行性。

Result: 算法在温和假设下被证明能全局收敛到帕累托临界（KKT稳定）点，实验结果表明该方法在确定性和进化方法中具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 广义简化雅可比方法成功地将简化雅可比方法推广到非线性约束多目标优化问题，提供了一种避免标量化的有效求解框架，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: In a recent work, we presented the reduced Jacobian method (RJM) as an
extension of Wolfe's reduced gradient method to multicriteria (multiobjective)
optimization problems dealing with linear constraints. This approach reveals
that using a reduction technique of the Jacobian matrix of the objective avoids
scalarization. In the present work, we intend to generalize RJM to handle
nonlinear constraints too. In fact, we propose a generalized reduced Jacobian
(GRJ) method that extends Abadie-Carpentier's approach for single-objective
programs. To this end, we adopt a global reduction strategy based on the
fundamental theorem of implicit functions. In this perspective, only a reduced
descent direction common to all the criteria is computed by solving a simple
convex program. After establishing an Armijo-type line search condition that
ensures feasibility, the resulting algorithm is shown to be globally
convergent, under mild assumptions, to a Pareto critical (KKT-stationary)
point. Finally, experimental results are presented, including comparisons with
other deterministic and evolutionary approaches.

Result: 证明了actor-critic流的稳定性和指数收敛到最优策略。

Conclusion: 分析了时间尺度分离和熵正则化之间的相互作用及其对稳定性和收敛性的影响。

Abstract: We prove the stability and global convergence of a coupled actor-critic
gradient flow for infinite-horizon and entropy-regularised Markov decision
processes (MDPs) in continuous state and action space with linear function
approximation under Q-function realisability. We consider a version of the
actor critic gradient flow where the critic is updated using temporal
difference (TD) learning while the policy is updated using a policy mirror
descent method on a separate timescale. We demonstrate stability and
exponential convergence of the actor critic flow to the optimal policy.
Finally, we address the interplay of the timescale separation and entropy
regularisation and its effect on stability and convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数学优化的许多应用中，需要优化无法获取导数的目标函数，这需要无导数优化方法。基于模型的信赖域方法在实践中很成功，但其计算复杂度理论分析落后于实践，特别是需要界定达到期望精度所需的函数评估次数。

Method: 系统推导经典基于模型信赖域方法及其现代变体的复杂度界限，进行理论分析

Result: 首次证明这些方法的最坏情况复杂度与其他已知DFO方法相同

Conclusion: 基于模型的信赖域方法在计算复杂度方面具有与其他无导数优化方法相当的效率

Abstract: In many applications of mathematical optimization, one may wish to optimize
an objective function without access to its derivatives. These situations call
for derivative-free optimization (DFO) methods. Among the most successful
approaches in practice are model-based trust-region methods, such as those
pioneered by M.J.D Powell. While relatively complex to implement, these methods
are now available in standard scientific computing platforms, including MATLAB
and SciPy. However, theoretical analysis of their computational complexity lags
behind practice. In particular, it is important to bound the number of function
evaluations required to achieve a desired level of accuracy. In this paper we
systematically derive complexity bounds for classical model-based trust-region
methods and their modern variations. We establish, for the first time, that
these methods can have the same worst case complexity than any other known DFO
method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于决策一致性的模型有效性验证方法DOTechnique，通过评估替代模型与高保真模型是否产生等价决策来确定模型有效性区域，无需预定义有效性边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型有效性验证方法依赖预定义的有效性框架，但这些框架可能不可用或不充分。需要一种新方法来基于决策一致性确定模型有效性。

Method: DOTechnique方法通过评估替代模型与高保真模型的决策等价性来确定有效性区域，结合领域约束和符号推理来缩小搜索空间，提高计算效率。

Result: 以高速公路变道系统为例，展示了DOTechnique能够发现仿真模型的有效性区域。

Conclusion: 该技术有潜力通过决策者上下文来支持发现模型有效性。

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否会在经典的认知科学范式——列联判断任务中产生因果幻觉，这种认知偏差可能导致社会偏见、刻板印象形成、错误信息和迷信思维等社会问题。

Method: 构建了1000个医疗情境下的零相关场景数据集，在这些情境中可用信息不足以建立变量间的因果关系，然后提示LLMs评估潜在原因的有效性。

Result: 所有评估的模型都系统性地推断出无根据的因果关系，显示出对因果幻觉的强烈易感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持LLMs只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设，并对在需要准确因果推理的领域中使用语言模型提出了担忧。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

TL;DR: GammaZero提出了一个基于动作中心图表示的学习框架，用于在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程中指导规划。该方法通过图神经网络学习小规模问题的价值函数和策略，然后零样本泛化到更大规模的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要领域特定的神经网络架构且难以扩展，GammaZero旨在开发一个统一的图表示框架，能够在领域内跨问题规模泛化。

Method: 将信念状态系统性地转换为动作中心图，使用图神经网络和编码器-解码器架构从小规模问题的专家演示中学习价值函数和策略，然后应用这些学习到的启发式来指导蒙特卡洛树搜索解决更大问题。

Result: 在标准POMDP基准测试中，GammaZero在相同规模问题上与BetaZero性能相当，同时能够零样本泛化到训练时未见过的2-4倍大规模问题，在保持解质量的同时减少搜索需求。

Conclusion: GammaZero通过动作中心图表示实现了在POMDP中的可扩展规划，展示了从易处理问题学习并泛化到更复杂问题的能力。

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前沿AI模型监管提案因安全-创新权衡而被搁置，需要一种既能确保AI安全又不会阻碍创新的监管方法。

Method: 强制要求大型AI实验室发布小型开放访问的类比模型，作为公共代理，让广泛的研究社区能够参与安全验证、可解释性研究和算法透明度工作。

Conclusion: 这一政策不仅应该被采纳，还展示了一个更广泛的原则：对模型的深入理解能够缓解安全-创新权衡，让我们同时获得更多安全性和创新性。

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出STEMS框架，一种安全约束的多智能体强化学习方法，用于协调建筑能源管理，通过空间-时间图表示学习和控制屏障函数实现安全保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多建筑能源系统中空间-时间依赖关系利用不足、缺乏严格安全保证和系统复杂性的挑战，实现碳减排目标、提升居住舒适度和降低能源成本。

Method: 集成GCN-Transformer融合架构的空间-时间图表示学习框架捕捉建筑间关系和时序模式，结合控制屏障函数的安全约束多智能体强化学习算法提供数学安全保证。

Result: 在真实建筑数据集上，STEMS相比现有方法实现21%成本降低、18%排放减少，安全违规从35.1%降至5.6%，仅0.13的不适比例保持最优舒适度。

Conclusion: STEMS框架在极端天气条件下表现出强鲁棒性，在不同建筑类型中保持有效性，为协调建筑能源管理提供了安全可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

Method: 引入两个基础模型：主机代理模型（负责与用户交互、任务分解和协调执行）和任务生命周期模型（详细描述子任务从创建到完成的状态转换），并定义了17个主机代理属性和14个任务生命周期属性。

Conclusion: 该框架为多AI代理系统提供了统一的语义基础，能够预防死锁和安全漏洞，确保系统在关键应用中的安全性和功能性。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出轻量级多模态架构，融合传感器数据和视觉图像预测文化遗产地退化严重程度，在数据稀缺情况下实现76.9%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产地因气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测方法无法捕捉环境压力与材料退化之间的复杂相互作用

Method: 采用简化的PerceiverIO架构，使用64D潜在空间防止小数据集过拟合，并引入自适应Barlow Twins损失促进模态互补性

Result: 在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%准确率，比标准多模态架构提升43%，比单模态方法提升显著

Conclusion: 架构简化与对比正则化结合可在数据稀缺的遗产监测环境中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习研究进展迅速，但在商业视频游戏中的应用仍然缓慢。本文旨在解决游戏AI社区在实际使用RL驱动NPC时面临的常见挑战，并探索RL与行为树的结合点。

Method: 使用AMD Schola插件在Unreal Engine中训练RL代理，创建多任务NPC。提供了将RL模型与行为树联合训练的详细方法，并在受《最后生还者》启发的复杂3D环境中展示各种技能。

Result: 证明了RL与行为树结合方法的可行性，成功在复杂3D环境中训练出多任务NPC，展示了各种技能的实现。

Conclusion: RL与行为树的交集是一个值得进一步探索的关键节点，虽然已有研究提出这种结合，但实际应用仍然罕见。本文通过实际案例证明了这种方法的实用价值。

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JEDA是一个用于临床订单检索的双编码器系统，通过联合嵌入直接和上下文对话，实现实时临床订单检索，无需LLM重写，减少延迟和不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床对话包含显性指令和隐性推理，现有系统依赖LLM重写会带来延迟、不稳定性和不透明性，阻碍实时订单处理。

Method: 基于PubMedBERT初始化的双编码器，使用重复安全对比目标进行微调，通过受限LLM指导将不同意图表达对齐到共享订单概念，支持查询和无查询两种模式。

Result: 在实践中部署JEDA获得显著提升，大幅优于基础编码器和最新开放嵌入器，提供快速、可解释、无LLM的实时检索层。

Conclusion: JEDA成功实现了将环境上下文链接到可操作临床订单的实时检索，具有噪声弹性，减少了对不流畅和ASR错误的敏感性。

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法对奖励函数规范高度敏感，这限制了其广泛应用。传统方法需要手动设计奖励函数，过程复杂且容易出错。

Method: 使用基础模型将自然语言规范自动生成奖励机，为每个自动机状态关联语言嵌入以实现跨任务泛化。

Result: 在多种挑战性环境中验证了ARM-FM的有效性，包括零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ARM-FM通过结合基础模型和奖励机，实现了从自然语言到结构化奖励规范的自动转换，解决了强化学习中奖励设计的关键挑战。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一个在线骚扰代理基准，包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、基于重复博弈论的多代理模拟、三种越狱攻击方法以及混合评估框架。研究发现越狱调优显著提高了骚扰攻击成功率，使侮辱和谩骂行为大幅增加，并揭示了闭源和开源模型的不同升级轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究主要关注单轮提示，而真实骚扰通常发生在多轮交互中。需要开发多轮和理论基础的攻击方法来评估LLM代理的安全性。

Method: 创建了包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、基于重复博弈论的多代理模拟、三种针对记忆、规划和微调的越狱攻击方法，以及混合评估框架。使用了LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemini-2.0-flash两个模型进行测试。

Result: 越狱调优使骚扰攻击成功率在Llama中从57.25-64.19%提高到95.78-96.89%，在Gemini中从98.46%提高到99.33%。侮辱行为从44.2-50.8%增加到84.9-87.8%，谩骂行为从31.5-38.8%增加到81.2-85.1%。闭源模型显示出显著脆弱性。

Conclusion: 多轮和理论基础的攻击不仅成功率高，还能模拟人类骚扰动态，强调了开发强大安全防护措施的必要性，以保持在线平台的安全和负责任。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

Conclusion: LiveResearchBench和DeepEval为深度研究系统提供了严格的评估基础，有助于推动可靠、有洞察力的深度研究系统的发展。

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

Motivation: 研究如何在不依赖人工标注数据集或预定义规则奖励的情况下，通过自我学习扩展基于LLM的智能体能力。

Conclusion: 奖励来源和数据规模是开放域智能体学习的关键杠杆，多角色协同进化是实现可扩展自我改进智能体的有效方法。

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released

TL;DR: GuardSpace是一个保护LLM安全对齐的框架，通过分解安全相关和无关的权重组件，并限制适配器更新，在微调过程中保持模型的安全行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在微调过程中容易丧失预训练的安全对齐能力，导致生成有害响应，需要一种方法来保护安全机制。

Method: 使用协方差预处理的奇异值分解将预训练权重分解为安全相关和无关组件，初始化低秩适配器时冻结安全相关部分，并构建零空间投影器限制适配器更新对有害提示的影响。

Result: 在多个下游任务上的实验表明，GuardSpace优于现有方法。对于Llama-2-7B-Chat在GSM8K上的微调，将平均有害分数从14.4%降至3.6%，同时准确率从26.0%提升至28.0%。

Conclusion: GuardSpace能够有效保护LLM在微调过程中的安全对齐，在保持安全性的同时提升任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Terrarium框架，用于在基于LLM的多智能体系统中进行细粒度的安全、隐私和安全性研究，通过重构黑板设计创建模块化测试平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统能够自动化用户任务，但引入了新的风险，包括错位、恶意方攻击、智能体被破坏或用户数据被盗。

Method: 重新利用多智能体系统中的黑板设计，创建模块化、可配置的多智能体协作测试平台，识别关键攻击向量并实现三种协作场景和四种代表性攻击。

Result: 开发了Terrarium框架，提供快速原型设计、评估和防御迭代的工具，展示了框架的灵活性。

Conclusion: Terrarium旨在加速可信多智能体系统的进展，通过提供工具来原型化、评估和迭代防御措施与设计。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: MASC是一个元认知框架，通过实时无监督的步骤级错误检测和自我纠正，增强多智能体系统的鲁棒性，防止错误级联传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在协作解决问题方面表现出色，但对级联错误很脆弱：单个错误步骤可能在智能体间传播并破坏整个轨迹。

Method: 采用两种互补设计：(1) 下一执行重构，从查询和交互历史预测下一步的嵌入以捕捉因果一致性；(2) 原型引导增强，学习正常步骤嵌入的原型先验，在稀疏上下文下稳定重构和异常评分。检测到异常步骤时触发纠正智能体。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，MASC始终优于所有基线，步骤级错误检测AUC-ROC提升高达8.47%；在不同多智能体框架中都能带来一致的端到端性能提升。

Conclusion: 元认知监控和针对性纠正能够以最小开销减轻错误传播，提高多智能体系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI服务大多是被动响应式，真正智能的助手应该能够预测用户需求并在适当时机主动采取行动。

Method: 基于AI眼镜构建Alpha-Service框架，包含输入单元、中央处理单元、算术逻辑单元、内存单元和输出单元五个核心组件，采用多智能体系统实现。

Conclusion: AI4Service代表了AI从被动工具向主动适应伴侣的演进，Alpha-Service框架为实现这一愿景提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

TL;DR: IP-Merging方法通过识别多模态大语言模型和数学推理大语言模型中的关键推理参数，将其投影到多模态模型的子空间进行合并，从而无需调优即可提升多模态模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在数学推理能力上落后于纯文本大语言模型，但直接合并模型参数存在对齐问题，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出IP-Merging方法：1）识别模型中的推理相关参数；2）将参数投影到多模态模型的子空间；3）在该子空间中合并参数。

Result: 实验表明IP-Merging能有效提升多模态大语言模型的数学推理能力，且不影响其他能力。

Conclusion: IP-Merging是一种无需调优的方法，能成功将数学推理能力从纯文本大语言模型迁移到多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

TL;DR: Hi-Agent是一个可训练的分层视觉语言代理，用于移动设备控制，通过高层推理模型和低层动作模型的联合优化，在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的移动设备控制方法大多依赖直接的状态到动作映射，缺乏结构化推理和规划，导致在新任务或未见UI布局上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出分层代理架构，包含高层推理模型和低层动作模型，通过将多步决策重新表述为单步子目标序列，并引入前瞻优势函数来利用低层模型的执行反馈指导高层优化，解决了GRPO在长视野任务中的路径爆炸问题。

Result: 在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的SOTA任务成功率，显著优于提示式(17.7%)、监督式(54.5%)和强化学习式(71.9%)方法；在ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中展示了竞争力的零样本泛化能力；在更复杂的AndroidWorld基准测试中，随着骨干网络增大而有效扩展。

Conclusion: Hi-Agent通过分层设计和联合优化策略，在移动设备控制任务中实现了卓越的性能和泛化能力，为复杂场景下的自主操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了IMAGINE框架，将多智能体系统的推理规划能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，通过端到端训练显著超越MAS性能，在TravelPlanner基准测试中达到82.7%的最终通过率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理和规划任务中仍面临挑战，现有多智能体系统虽然能提供更好的集体推理，但存在推理成本高、响应延迟长和端到端训练困难等问题。

Method: 提出IMAGINE框架，将多智能体系统的推理和规划能力集成到单一模型中，通过简单的端到端训练实现性能提升。

Result: 使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型，在TravelPlanner基准测试中达到82.7%的最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功将多智能体系统的能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，显著提升了推理规划性能，同时解决了MAS的高成本和训练困难问题。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

*Claudia Grundke,Gabriele Röger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个转换方法，用于消除PDDL公理中派生谓词的负出现，证明这种限制实际上不会减少表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDDL标准限制公理体中谓词的负出现只能针对由动作直接设置的谓词，而非由公理派生的谓词。但文献中作者常偏离此限制，只要求公理集可分层。本文旨在证明这两种变体实际上表达相同的查询能力。

Method: 提出了相应的转换方法，通过转换来消除派生谓词的负出现，从而证明两种变体的等价性。

Result: 证明了PDDL标准限制的变体和允许可分层公理的变体都能表达与最小不动点逻辑完全相同的查询，表明派生谓词的负出现可以被消除。

Conclusion: PDDL中对派生谓词负出现的限制实际上不会减少其表达能力，因为可以通过转换方法消除这些负出现，保持相同的查询表达能力。

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

Motivation: 联邦学习在去中心化数据训练模型方面具有强大潜力，但设计和部署鲁棒系统的复杂性常常削弱其优势。选择和调整策略以应对数据异构性和系统约束等多方面挑战已成为关键瓶颈，导致脆弱、定制的解决方案。

Method: Helmsman通过三个协作阶段模拟原则性研发工作流：(1)交互式人机协同规划制定研究计划，(2)监督智能体团队进行模块化代码生成，(3)在沙盒模拟环境中进行自主评估和优化的闭环过程。

Result: 在包含16个多样化任务的AgentFL-Bench新基准上进行的广泛实验表明，该方法生成的解决方案与现有手工构建的基线方法具有竞争力，且通常更优。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向复杂去中心化AI系统自动化工程迈出的重要一步，Helmsman系统能够有效解决联邦学习系统设计的复杂性挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

TL;DR: JSPLIT是一个基于分类学的框架，通过层次化组织工具并基于用户查询选择最相关工具，有效解决MCP工具使用中的提示膨胀问题，显著减少提示大小同时保持代理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统发展，用户期望从简单的文本交互转向更复杂的代理系统，需要LLM与外部工具交互。MCP等标准虽然扩展了代理能力，但导致提示膨胀问题：工具数量增加使提示变长，带来高token成本、延迟增加和任务成功率下降。

Method: JSPLIT框架将工具组织成层次化分类学结构，使用用户提示基于查询和分类学结构识别并仅包含最相关工具，包括分类学设计、工具选择算法和评估数据集。

Result: JSPLIT显著减少了提示大小，且未显著影响代理响应能力。当可用工具数量大幅增长时，JSPLIT甚至提高了代理的工具选择准确性，在降低成本的同时改善了高复杂度代理环境中的任务成功率。

Conclusion: JSPLIT通过分类学驱动的方法有效管理MCP工具使用中的提示大小问题，在工具数量增长时既能降低成本又能提高任务成功率，适用于复杂代理环境。

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

Conclusion: 研究显示了将预训练LLM适应开放性的前景和当前局限，为训练代理管理记忆、进行生产性探索和追求抽象长期目标指明了未来方向。

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

Method: 引入Rose-Frame三维框架，包括：(i)地图与领土，区分现实表示与现实本身；(ii)直觉与理性，基于双过程理论分离快速情感判断与缓慢反思思维；(iii)冲突与确认，检验思想是通过分歧批判测试还是通过相互验证强化。

Result: Rose-Frame框架提供了诊断认知和认识论漂移的工具，使模型局限性和用户假设可见，促进了更透明和批判性意识的AI部署，将协调重新定义为认知治理。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入反思性、可证伪的监督，可以将机器流畅性与人类理解协调一致，强调直觉（无论是人类还是人工的）必须由人类理性治理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

*Sara Altamirano,Arjan Vreeken,Sennay Ghebreab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对2021-2025年荷兰公共卫生机器学习研究中的算法偏见进行了系统文献综述，开发了RABAT评估工具，发现普遍存在公平性框架缺失等问题，并提出了ACAR四阶段框架来帮助研究人员在ML生命周期中解决公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在公共卫生领域具有革命性潜力，但如果不系统关注算法偏见，可能会无意中加剧现有的健康不平等。

Method: 开发了RABAT评估工具，整合了Cochrane偏见风险、PROBAST和微软负责任AI清单等成熟框架，对35篇同行评审研究进行了系统分析。

Result: 分析显示普遍存在差距：虽然数据采样和缺失数据实践记录良好，但大多数研究忽略了明确的公平性框架、亚组分析以及潜在危害的透明讨论。

Conclusion: 提出了ACAR四阶段公平性导向框架，为公共卫生ML从业者提供了可操作建议，确保算法创新促进健康公平而非损害它。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索系统无法在威胁、行为和防御之间进行清晰可逆的推理，需要开发能够执行确定性推理的威胁情报系统。

Method: 集成路径规划模型预测逻辑关系链，图执行器遍历TITAN本体图谱，构建包含88209个示例的数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 实证评估显示TITAN能够生成语法有效且语义连贯的推理路径，可在底层图谱上确定性执行。

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询到可执行推理的转换，为威胁情报分析提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统以人类为中心的AI伦理方法存在局限，需要发展不受人类道德直觉预设的、能够适应情境的伦理行为模型。

Method: 提出神经符号架构，结合主动推理和符号推理，让智能体在动态多智能体环境中最小化全局期望自由能量，实现伦理行为的涌现。

Result: 通过伦理资源分配的案例研究，展示了NAEL能够动态平衡自我保存、认知学习和集体福利。

Conclusion: NAEL为人工智能系统提供了一种非人类中心主义的伦理框架，能够发展出情境敏感、自适应和关系性的伦理行为。

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

Conclusion: 功利主义算法配置方法经过改进后已具备实际应用价值，能够有效平衡理论保证与实用性能，并为算法选择问题的鲁棒性分析提供了可行方法。

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法中，任务向量包含任务无关的冗余信息，导致合并模型性能显著下降。现有方法随机丢弃参数缺乏知识感知。

Method: 通过采样训练样本获取协方差矩阵，进行上下文导向的奇异值分解，在知识感知子空间中将微调模型权重分解为任务相关和冗余成分，并剪枝冗余成分。引入谱秩分配策略优化归一化激活剪枝误差。

Result: PAVE作为即插即用方案适用于各种基于任务向量的合并方法，在多种合并方法、任务和模型架构中证明有效。

Conclusion: PAVE方法能有效净化任务向量中的冗余信息，提升模型合并性能，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合细粒度波束搜索和过程奖励模型ToolPRM的推理扩展框架，用于提升大语言模型在结构化输出（如函数调用）任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理扩展研究主要关注非结构化输出生成任务，而在结构化输出（如函数调用）中的应用研究不足。需要填补这一空白，提升LLM在结构化输出任务中的性能。

Method: 使用细粒度波束搜索结合过程奖励模型ToolPRM，该模型通过函数掩码技术自动标注的细粒度过程监督数据集训练，对单个函数调用的内部步骤进行评分。

Result: ToolPRM在预测准确性上优于粗粒度和结果奖励模型，表明其在监督函数调用推理过程方面具有更强能力。配备ToolPRM的推理扩展技术显著提升了骨干模型在各种函数调用任务和基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了将推理扩展技术应用于结构化输出的关键原则："多探索少保留"，这是由于结构化函数调用生成的不可恢复性特征决定的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

TL;DR: 提出了SimKO方法来解决RLVR中的过度集中问题，通过不对称地调整正确和错误回答的概率分布来鼓励探索，提高pass@K性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在系统性偏向利用而非探索的问题，表现为pass@1提升但pass@K下降，需要解决概率过度集中现象

Method: SimKO方法：对已验证正确回答提升top-K候选概率，对已验证错误回答对top-1候选施加更强惩罚，特别在高熵token上应用

Result: 在各种数学和逻辑推理基准测试中，SimKO持续为广泛的K值范围带来更高的pass@K性能

Conclusion: SimKO提供了一种简单有效的方法来改善RLVR的探索能力，缓解概率过度集中问题

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

TL;DR: Datalake Agent是一个代理系统，通过交互式循环减少LLM在NL2SQL任务中使用的元信息，从而大幅降低token使用量和处理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL2SQL方法需要处理大量数据库元信息，导致提示过长、token使用多、处理成本高。

Method: 采用代理式交互循环，在推理框架中让LLM选择性请求必要信息来解决表格问答任务，而不是一次性提供所有元信息。

Result: 在23个数据库的100个表格问答任务上评估，Datalake Agent将LLM使用的token减少高达87%，同时保持竞争力性能。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent能显著降低NL2SQL任务的成本，同时维持良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于监督微调的大语言模型和视觉语言模型在长视野操作任务中仍面临常识和推理能力受限的问题，泛化能力差且物理理解不足。

Method: 采用两阶段微调框架：监督训练从专家序列获取基础知识，然后通过强化学习解决模型在视觉空间理解和推理方面的不足，设计了考虑长视野性能和动作约束的基于规则的奖励函数。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上训练的推理模型在EmbodiedBench基准上比GPT-4o-mini提升21.33%，比在Qwen2.5-VL-7B上训练的其他工作提升20.33%。

Conclusion: 两阶段微调框架有效提升了具身智能体的推理能力，证明了强化学习在解决视觉空间理解和多步推理任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting是一种后生成方法，通过提高LLM对提示指令的遵循率来增强可靠性，在2条指令时提升7个百分点，10条指令时提升4个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者通常通过修改提示来影响LLM行为，但仅添加更多指令无法保证它们会被遵循，需要提高指令遵循的可靠性。

Method: 提出Instruction Boosting作为后生成方法，并引入SCALEDIF基准测试（每条数据样本最多包含10条指令），开发了定量冲突评分工具来分析指令间的冲突。

Result: Instruction Boosting显著提高了指令遵循率，同时发现随着指令数量增加，性能下降的主要原因是指令间的紧张和冲突增加。

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting能有效提升LLM对多指令的遵循能力，冲突评分工具可为开发者提供关于添加额外提示指令对模型性能影响的反馈。

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的生成-过滤-精炼迭代范式在推理、编程和科学发现方面取得了进展，但搜索效果取决于如何将领域先验编码为操作化结构化的假设空间。

Method: 将智能体表示为输入和输出的模糊关系算子来捕捉可行转换，通过单一延续参数加权所有可达路径并求和得到覆盖生成函数，从而诱导出可达性难度的度量。

Result: 该理论提供了可操作的语言和工具来测量智能体及其搜索空间，并通过多数投票实例验证了最简单的可测试推断。

Conclusion: 该理论为LLM构建的迭代搜索提供了系统的形式化描述，能够有效测量智能体和搜索空间。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的智能体，能够在没有标注数据的情况下自我改进，通过生成针对性网络搜索查询来收集外部证据，从而提高企业日志数据中模式映射的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业智能平台需要集成来自多个第三方供应商的日志数据，但供应商文档在测试时往往不可用、不匹配或格式混乱，导致模式映射困难。

Method: 使用强化学习智能体，在推理时：1)识别模糊的字段映射尝试；2)生成针对性网络搜索查询收集外部证据；3)应用基于置信度的奖励来迭代优化映射。

Result: 在将Microsoft Defender for Endpoint日志转换为通用模式的任务中，该方法将映射准确率从56.4%(仅LLM)提升到72.73%(RAG)再到93.94%(100次迭代后)，同时将需要专家审查的低置信度映射减少了85%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种基于证据的透明解决方案，为未来行业问题提供了更稳健、可扩展、高效和灵活的方法。

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将康德的《纯粹理性批判》重新解释为反馈稳定性理论，提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk来诊断推理系统的过度自信问题，并在线性高斯模拟和LLM中验证了该框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将康德的理性自我限制理论与反馈控制理论联系起来，为诊断推理系统的过度自信问题提供理论框架。

Method: 提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk，结合谱边界、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大等指标，在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行验证。

Result: H-Risk能够预测正式稳定性下的过度自信错误；在LLM中，脆弱的内部动态与校准错误和幻觉相关，批判式提示对校准和幻觉有混合影响。

Conclusion: 该研究在康德自我限制理论与反馈控制之间建立了结构性桥梁，为诊断和选择性减少推理系统中的过度自信提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

TL;DR: GroundedPRM是一个基于树引导和保真度感知的自动过程监督框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径，使用外部工具验证中间步骤，结合步骤级验证和全局结果评估，显著提升多步推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型面临三大挑战：噪声奖励、低事实保真度以及与步骤级推理目标的不对齐。这些挑战源于缺乏可扩展的高质量标注，现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注、易产生幻觉的LLM自评估或存在信用分配问题的蒙特卡洛估计。

Method: 1) 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径，实现细粒度信用分配；2) 通过外部工具验证每个中间步骤，提供基于执行的正确性信号；3) 设计混合奖励聚合机制，融合工具验证和MCTS反馈；4) 将奖励信号格式化为理由增强的生成结构。

Result: 仅使用4万自动标注样本（最佳自动监督PRM数据量的10%），在ProcessBench上实现高达26%的相对性能提升。用于奖励引导的贪婪搜索时，甚至优于使用人工标注监督训练的PRM。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM为高质量过程级推理提供了一条可扩展且可验证的路径，通过树引导和保真度感知的方法有效解决了现有PRM的核心局限性。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.
