### [1] [BrowserArena: Evaluating LLM Agents on Real-World Web Navigation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02418)
*Sagnik Anupam,Davis Brown,Shuo Li,Eric Wong,Hamed Hassani,Osbert Bastani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrowserArena是一个实时开放的网页代理评估平台，通过用户提交任务、Arena式对比和步骤级人工反馈来识别网页代理的失败模式，发现了验证码解决、弹窗移除和直接URL导航三个主要问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页代理评估局限于沙盒环境或人工任务，需要真实开放网页环境下的评估平台来发现实际使用中的问题。

Method: 构建BrowserArena平台，收集用户任务，进行Arena式对比评估，使用步骤级人工反馈分析代理轨迹，并针对发现的失败模式构建专门数据集进行深入研究。

Result: 识别出三个一致的失败模式：验证码解决、弹窗移除和直接URL导航。不同语言模型在这些任务上表现各异，如o4-mini使用更多策略绕过验证码，DeepSeek-R1在验证码解决上误导用户。

Conclusion: 当前网页代理存在多样性和脆弱性，提出的基准测试方法为大规模评估和理解网页代理失败模式提供了可行途径。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

*Hang Wu,Yujun Cai,Haonan Ge,Hongkai Chen,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了ShotBench基准测试在电影摄影理解任务中的局限性，提出了RefineShot基准来改进评估可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现ShotBench基准存在选项设计模糊问题，且ShotVL模型在推理一致性和指令遵循方面存在不足，影响了评估的公平性和未来进展

Method: 通过一致的选项重构系统化改进ShotBench，首次对ShotVL的推理行为进行批判性分析，并引入联合评估任务准确性和核心模型能力的扩展协议

Result: 开发了RefineShot基准，这是一个经过改进和扩展的基准，能够实现更可靠的评估

Conclusion: RefineShot基准有助于促进电影摄影理解领域的未来发展，提供了更公平的比较和更可靠的评估框架

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

### [3] [Safe and Efficient In-Context Learning via Risk Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02480)
*Andrea Wynn,Metod Jazbec,Charith Peris,Rinat Khaziev,Anqi Liu,Daniel Khashabi,Eric Nalisnick*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分布无关风险控制的方法，通过动态提前退出机制来防御恶意上下文示例对LLM性能的负面影响，同时保持对有益示例的计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能够从少量上下文示例中学习新任务，但这种灵活性带来了安全隐患：恶意或错误的示例可能被注入而未被察觉，从而影响模型性能。

Method: 定义零样本下的安全行为作为基线，应用分布无关风险控制来限制上下文示例对性能的负面影响，采用动态提前退出预测机制，忽略关注不安全输入的后层注意力头。

Result: 理论和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制有害上下文示例的风险，同时在有益示例上实现显著的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为LLM提供了内置的安全机制，能够在保持对有益示例性能提升的同时，防御恶意上下文示例的攻击。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

### [4] [Multimodal Function Vectors for Spatial Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02528)
*Shuhao Fu,Esther Goldberg,Ying Nian Wu,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型多模态模型中的一小部分注意力头负责传递空间关系表示，这些注意力头的激活（称为功能向量）可以被提取和操控来改变模型在关系任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型展现出强大的上下文学习能力，但其支持任务学习的内在机制仍不透明，需要深入理解模型如何编码和处理空间关系知识。

Method: 使用因果中介分析识别影响关系预测的注意力头，提取多模态功能向量，并在保持模型参数冻结的情况下用少量训练数据微调这些向量。

Result: 提取的功能向量能提高零样本推理准确率，经过微调后显著优于上下文学习基线，并能线性组合解决涉及未训练空间关系的类比问题。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在局部内部结构中编码空间关系知识，这些知识可以被系统提取和优化，这有助于理解模型模块化特性并增强对关系推理的控制。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了自主管理代理的概念，用于协调动态人机团队中的复杂多智能体工作流，将工作流管理形式化为部分可观测随机博弈，并识别了四个关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然智能体AI在自动化单个任务方面取得了进展，但管理复杂的多智能体工作流仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，需要开发能够协调人机协作的自主管理系统。

Method: 提出了自主管理代理框架，将工作流管理形式化为部分可观测随机博弈，开发了MA-Gym开源仿真评估框架，并使用GPT-5基础的管理代理在20个工作流上进行评估。

Result: 评估发现基于GPT-5的管理代理难以同时优化目标完成、约束遵守和工作流运行时间，表明工作流管理是一个困难的开放性问题。

Conclusion: 工作流管理是一个重要的开放性问题，自主管理系统具有组织和伦理影响，需要进一步研究来解决识别出的四个基础挑战。

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的智能体系统能够自动化和加速增材制造中的合金发现任务，展示了采用这种多智能体系统的优势。

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials
science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language
Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their
extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and
lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个包含起重机调度的CSPP Gym环境，评估了5种RL算法在不同复杂度场景下的性能，发现算法选择和问题表述对CSPP至关重要


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集装箱配载规划(CSPP)对海运效率至关重要，但现有研究中不同强化学习算法的系统性基准比较有限

Method: 开发了包含起重机调度的CSPP Gym环境，在多智能体和单智能体框架下评估DQN、QR-DQN、A2C、PPO和TRPO五种RL算法

Result: 结果显示随着复杂度增加，性能差距明显，算法选择和问题表述对CSPP性能有重要影响

Conclusion: 为CSPP提供了多RL方法的基准测试和可重用的Gym环境，为未来海运物流研究和实际部署奠定了基础

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于多模态大语言模型的框架，处理视觉感知、车辆遥测等多模态数据，为驾驶员生成自然语言警报，提升电动汽车在城市驾驶中的安全性。

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

### [9] [Mitigating Modal Imbalance in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02608)
*Chen Henry Wu,Neil Kale,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基础模型在多模态联合推理中的表现，特别是在跨模态冲突场景下。研究发现模型在单模态中能识别90%的冲突，但在跨模态场景中识别率降至3%，主要原因是跨模态注意力不平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基础模型在真实世界任务中处理多模态联合推理的能力，特别是当不同模态之间存在交互和关联形成跨模态上下文时，模型能否进行有效推理。

Method: 通过设计跨模态冲突实验场景，分析模型在不同模态间出现矛盾证据时的表现，并研究跨模态注意力不平衡问题。提出通过显式组合多种模态的训练实例来减少注意力不平衡。

Result: 实验显示基础模型在单模态冲突识别中达到90%准确率，但在跨模态冲突中识别率降至3%。研究发现模型存在严重的跨模态注意力不对称，某些模态被过度优先考虑。通过显式组合模态的训练方法能显著减少注意力不平衡。

Conclusion: 跨模态注意力不平衡是基础模型在多模态推理中的关键问题，需要系统性地解决跨模态上下文问题才能构建可靠的基础模型。简单的数据扩展无法解决此问题，需要显式的跨模态训练策略。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

### [10] [On the Role of Temperature Sampling in Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02611)
*Yuheng Wu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现测试时扩展的温度维度缩放能显著提升大语言模型的推理能力，突破单一温度采样的性能瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明通过增加样本数量K可以提升推理准确率，但这种提升存在上限，某些难题无论多少推理轨迹都无法解决。不同采样温度能解决不同子集的问题，暗示单一温度只能探索模型潜力的一部分

Method: 提出温度维度缩放方法，通过在不同温度下生成推理轨迹来扩大模型的推理边界。还设计了多温度投票方法来降低温度缩放的开销

Result: 在Qwen3系列模型和五个代表性推理基准测试中，温度缩放比单一温度测试时扩展额外提升了7.3个百分点。基础模型通过温度缩放能达到与强化学习训练模型相当的性能，无需额外后训练

Conclusion: 测试时扩展比之前认为的更强大，温度缩放提供了一种简单有效的方法来释放基础模型的潜在能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

reaches an average of 0.87, indicating high consistency and accuracy in the
responses generated. The system offers an intuitive, web-based interface that
facilitates interaction and information retrieval for directors, teachers,

### [12] [A Concept of Possibility for Real-World Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02655)
*Daniel G. Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的可能性概念作为Zadeh(1978)标准概念的替代方案，专注于现实世界事件的可能性计算，适用于规划问题中的可行性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可能性概念存在局限性，需要一种更专注于现实世界事件可能性的新理论，特别是用于评估规划问题的可行性。

Method: 将事件视为具有促进发生的先决条件和阻碍发生的约束条件，可能性计算为这些条件概率的函数，采用Łukasiewicz多值逻辑连接词解释。

Result: 开发了一个新的可能性理论框架，能够评估多个规划方案中哪个最可能实现目标，并通过车辆路径规划示例验证了该理论。

Conclusion: 新可能性理论为规划问题提供了有效的可行性评估工具，可能更符合人类对规划的推理方式，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

TL;DR: AutoMaAS是一个自进化的多智能体架构搜索框架，通过神经架构搜索原则自动发现最优智能体配置，在提升性能的同时降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化设计方法寻求单一解决方案，无法根据查询复杂度和领域需求自适应分配资源，需要更灵活的多智能体系统设计框架。

Method: 采用动态算子生命周期管理、自动机器学习技术，包括自动算子生成/融合/消除、动态成本感知优化、在线反馈集成和决策追踪机制。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，性能提升1.0-7.1%，推理成本降低3-5%，在数据集和LLM骨干网络上表现出优越的迁移性。

Conclusion: 为大语言模型时代的自动化多智能体系统设计建立了新范式，实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

### [14] [ARMs: Adaptive Red-Teaming Agent against Multimodal Models with Plug-and-Play Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02677)
*Zhaorun Chen,Xun Liu,Mintong Kang,Jiawei Zhang,Minzhou Pan,Shuang Yang,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARMs是一个自适应红队代理，通过推理增强的多步编排自动优化多样化红队策略，有效引发目标VLM的有害输出，在基准测试中平均攻击成功率超过基线52.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型(VLMs)的普及，其多模态接口引入了新的安全漏洞，现有红队方法要么局限于有限的对抗模式，要么依赖人工工程，缺乏对新兴真实世界漏洞的可扩展探索。

Method: 提出11种新颖的多模态攻击策略，涵盖VLM的多样化对抗模式；通过模型上下文协议集成17种红队算法；设计分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法平衡攻击多样性和有效性。

Result: 在实例和政策基准测试中达到最先进的攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%；构建了ARMs-Bench，包含超过30K红队实例的规模化多模态安全数据集。

Conclusion: 使用ARMs-Bench进行安全微调显著提高了VLM的鲁棒性，同时保持其通用效用，为改进多模态安全对齐提供了可操作指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

TL;DR: 提出了一种约束中心架构，利用LLM实现生产调度中可靠的自动约束规范，解决了LLM直接应用时的自然语言模糊性和非确定性输出问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然APS系统在现代制造中至关重要，但将制造需求转化为正式约束的过程仍然需要大量人工工作。尽管LLM在自动化约束规范方面有潜力，但直接应用面临自然语言模糊性、非确定性输出和领域知识有限等挑战。

Method: 设计了一个约束中心架构，通过领域特定表示定义层次化结构空间（三个层级），并开发了自动生产场景适配算法来为特定制造配置定制架构。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法成功平衡了LLM的生成能力和制造系统的可靠性要求，在约束规范任务中显著优于纯LLM方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的约束中心架构能够可靠地自动化生产调度中的约束规范，有效结合了LLM的生成能力和制造系统的确定性要求。

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV)框架，通过节点级一致性检查来验证大语言模型的多步推理，提高错误定位精度并减少token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在验证多步推理时存在错误定位不精确和token成本高的问题，要么评估整个推理链导致注意力稀释，要么依赖昂贵的多重采样。

Method: NCV将验证重构为节点级的轻量级二元一致性检查，将思维链分解为相互连接的验证节点，避免不必要的长文本生成。

Result: 在公开数据集上，NCV相比传统方法如基于CoT的验证器，F1分数提升10%到25%，同时token使用量减少6倍到58倍。

Conclusion: NCV提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，提高了LLM推理验证的可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强基准测试主要依赖答案匹配评估，但无法评估复杂任务中的问题解决轨迹，如效率、幻觉和适应性等关键方面。

Method: 引入TRACE框架，通过证据库积累推理步骤知识，实现多维度评估。创建包含多样化有缺陷轨迹的元评估数据集进行验证。

Result: TRACE能够准确评估复杂行为，即使使用小型开源LLM也能实现可扩展且成本效益高的评估，并揭示了先前未报告的观察结果。

Conclusion: TRACE为工具增强LLM代理提供了有效的多维度评估方法，超越了传统答案匹配的限制，能够全面评估问题解决轨迹。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文挑战了机器学习中的目标满足假设(OSA)，指出由于近似、估计和优化误差，模型无法真正满足指定目标函数。即使在目标规范良好的情况下，完美捕捉开发者意图也是不可能的，导致目标错误指定不可避免。基于数学分析，这些差距在强优化压力下会演变成Goodhart定律的失效模式，因此需要对通用AI系统的优化设置原则性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战机器学习中一个常见但很少被检验的假设——训练产生的模型确实满足其指定的目标函数(OSA)。作者认为在现实条件下，OSA必然会失败，这对AI系统的安全性和可控性有重要影响。

Method: 采用学习范式无关的框架，分析近似误差、估计误差和优化误差如何导致系统性偏离预期目标。基于最近的数学结果，论证这些差距在缺乏数学表征时无法与Goodhart定律失效模式区分。

Result: 证明了在现实条件下，目标满足假设必然失败，模型无法真正满足指定目标。目标错误指定是不可避免的，特别是在捕捉人类偏好等复杂意图时。

Conclusion: 由于无法预先确定Goodhart失效点，必须对通用AI系统的优化设置原则性限制。缺乏这种限制，持续优化可能导致系统进入可预测且不可逆的失控状态。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLHF/RLAIF流程依赖单一奖励模型，限制了对齐质量并存在过拟合风险。现有路由方法存在冷启动和探索不足的问题

Method: 混合路由框架：离线阶段训练多任务路由器估计每个RM的可靠性；在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样进行每查询RM选择，将离线嵌入作为高斯先验初始化权重向量，并通过在线奖励自适应更新后验分布

Result: 在指令跟随和推理基准测试中，BayesianRouter始终优于单个RM、RM集成和现有路由方法

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过有效结合离线和在线学习，解决了现有路由方法的局限性，显著提升了LLM对齐性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Motivation: 离散扩散模型（DDM）的优化面临挑战：非自回归范式使得重要性采样难以处理且rollout复杂，这给强化学习方法如GRPO带来了困难。

Method: 首先澄清DDM的理论基础，构建能够捕捉有价值token波动的重要性估计器；然后为视觉序列精心定制rollout方法，产生多样化的补全和可靠的优化梯度。

Result: 在数学推理、编码和视觉生成基准测试中，MaskGRPO带来了更稳定和高效的更新，导致更强的推理性能和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: 本研究确立了MaskGRPO作为一个系统性的策略优化方法，并且是离散化视觉扩散的第一个实用方法。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的深度学习方法是黑盒系统，缺乏对其推理过程的解释，这限制了其可信度和采用。XAI方法旨在通过提供模型决策过程的解释来克服这一挑战，但不同XAI方法基于不同的哲学假设，这些假设会影响解释的有效性。

Method: 研究XAI方法在应用于AI系统时的本体论和认识论假设，分析这些假设对AI解释有效性的影响，探讨XAI方法选择与底层哲学范式的关系。

Result: 分析表明，XAI方法中看似微小的技术变化可能对应于对解释基础假设的重要差异。忽略底层哲学范式在选择XAI方法时存在风险。

Conclusion: 在选择XAI方法时需要考虑其本体论和认识论假设，并根据具体应用领域选择和调整合适的方法，以确保解释的有效性和适用性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Motivation: 虽然反事实解释在可解释AI中是一个强大工具，但在基于规则的智能环境领域还没有成熟的生成方法，需要开发专门针对该领域的反事实解释框架。

Method: 开发了一个插件来扩展现有的智能环境解释引擎，实现了反事实解释的形式化和实现，并通过用户研究(N=17)评估反事实解释与传统因果解释的效果。

Result: 用户偏好高度情境化：因果解释因其语言简洁性和在时间压力下的适用性更受欢迎，而反事实解释因其可操作的内容在用户想要解决问题时更受青睐。

Conclusion: 本研究为智能环境中的新型解释提供了实用框架，并为选择最有效的解释类型提供了实证依据，表明应根据具体情境选择不同的解释方式。

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Motivation: 研究动机是探究AI系统在Raven渐进矩阵任务中的表现是否反映了真正的推理能力，还是仅仅依赖统计捷径，特别是在不完整训练条件下评估其泛化能力。

Method: 使用序列到序列的transformer模型和基于视觉的架构（如CoPINet和双对比网络），在Impartial-RAVEN数据集上进行评估，故意在训练中省略若干结构规则。

Result: 实验结果显示，transformer模型在熟悉规则上表现良好，但在面对新颖或省略的规则时准确率急剧下降；token级准确率与完整答案准确率之间的差距凸显了当前方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为深度学习模型的推理机制提供了新见解，强调需要超越模式识别、实现稳健抽象推理的架构设计。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

Conclusion: CCDD通过结合连续和离散模态的优势，解决了连续扩散模型的实际训练性问题，同时保持了理论上的表达能力优势。

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

TL;DR: 本文建立了N玩家Stackelberg博弈到其平均场极限的精确收敛速率，考虑了信息响应时间延迟、基于经验分布的交互和控制相关扩散系数等复杂特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献很少处理具有信息响应时间延迟、经验分布交互和控制相关扩散系数的Stackelberg博弈问题，这些特征使问题变得非标准且分析复杂，降低了收敛速率。

Method: 通过根据状态维度、延迟性质和系数假设对情况进行分类，分析不同子情况下的收敛速率，并建立精确的收敛速率界限。

Result: 在最一般情况下，当n₁>4时收敛速率为O(N^{-2(q-2)/[n₁(3q-4)})，其中n₁是跟随者状态维度，q是初始条件的积分阶数。在扩散系数与控制变量无关时，可获得O(N^{-2/(3n₁)})的收敛速率。

Conclusion: 本文结果扩展了文献中平均场Stackelberg博弈的标准o(1)收敛结果，以及具有主要和次要玩家的平均场博弈的O(N^{-1/(n₁+4)})收敛结果，在线性分布参数情况下建立了O(1/√N)的收敛速率。

Abstract: In this article, we establish precise convergence rates of a general class of
$N$-Player Stackelberg games to their mean field limits, which allows the
response time delay of information, empirical distribution based interactions,
and the control-dependent diffusion coefficients. All these features makes our
problem nonstandard, barely been touched in the literature, and they complicate
the analysis and therefore reduce the convergence rate. We first justify the
same convergence rate for both the followers and the leader. Specifically, for
the most general case, the convergence rate is shown to be
$\mathcal{O}\left(N^{-\frac{2(q-2)}{n_1(3q-4)}}\right)$ when $n_1>4$ where
$n_1$ is the dimension of the follower's state, and $q$ is the order of the
integration of the initial; and this rate has yet been shown in the literature,
to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, by classifying cases according to the
state dimension $n_1$, the nature of the delay, and the assumptions of the
coefficients, we provide several subcases where faster convergence rates can be
obtained; for instance the
$\mathcal{O}\left(N^{-\frac{2}{3n_1}}\right)$-convergence when the diffusion
coefficients are independent of control variable. Our result extends the
standard $o(1)$-convergence result for the mean field Stackelberg games in the
literature, together with the $\mathcal{O}(N^{-\frac{1}{n_1+4}})$-convergence
for the mean field games with major and minor players. We also discuss the
special case where our coefficients are linear in distribution argument while
nonlinear in state and control arguments, and we establish an
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$ convergence rate, which extends the linear quadratic
cases in the literature.

Method: 通过证明四种CQ在群作用下的不变性，将CQ有效性验证简化为检查完全约化映射胚的规范形式，并利用分类表进行验证。

Result: 在分类表中确定了每种胚的CQ有效性，发现存在大量泛型映射胚中GCQ成立而其他更强CQ失效的情况。

Conclusion: GCQ与其他约束条件之间的差距在泛型情况下普遍存在，这为约束优化的理论分析提供了完整的泛型图景。

Abstract: Constraint qualifications (CQs) are central to the local analysis of
constrained optimization. In this paper, we completely determine the validity
of the four classical CQs -- LICQ, MFCQ, ACQ, and GCQ -- for constraint
map-germs that arise in generic four-parameter families. Our approach begins by
proving that all four CQs are invariant under the action of the group
$\mathcal{K}[G]$ and under the operation of reduction. As a consequence, the
verification of CQ-validity for a generic constraint reduces to checking
CQ-validity on the $\mathcal{K}[G]$-normal forms of fully reduced map-germs.
Such normal forms have been classified in our recent work. In the present
paper, we verify which CQs hold in each germ appearing in the classification
tables from that work. This analysis provides a complete picture of the generic
landscape of the four classical CQs. Most notably, we find that there exist
numerous generic map-germs for which GCQ holds while all stronger CQs fail,
showing that the gap between GCQ and the other qualifications is not an
exceptional phenomenon but arises generically.

Abstract: We study Geraghty-type non-self mappings within the framework of best
proximity point theory. By introducing auxiliary functions with subsequential
convergence, we establish general conditions ensuring the existence and
uniqueness of best proximity points. Our results extend and unify earlier work
on proximal and Kannan-type contractions under a Geraghty setting, and we
provide counterexamples showing that the auxiliary assumptions are essential.
To demonstrate applicability, we construct a registration-inspired alignment
model in which all hypotheses can be explicitly verified. This example
illustrates how the theoretical framework guarantees a unique and well-defined
alignment anchor, thereby highlighting the relevance of best proximity theory
in registration problems.

Abstract: Electromagnetic wave manipulation plays a crucial role in advancing
technology across various domains, including photonic device design. This study
presents an inverse design approach for a periodic medium that optimizes
electromagnetic wave localization at the interface between a layered half-space
and a homogeneous half-space. The approach finds a maximally localized mode at
a specified frequency and wave number. The mode propagates in the direction of
the interface. The design parameters are the permittivity of the layered
medium, their relative thicknesses, and the permittivity of the homogeneous
half-space. We analyze the problem using the transfer matrix method and apply
the particle swarm optimization to find a rapidly decaying mode that satisfies
the design constraints. The design process is demonstrated in a numerical
example, which serves to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了同时包含状态和控制延迟的随机线性二次控制问题，为随机积分-微分系统提供了闭环可解性，具有理论和应用价值。

Abstract: A general and new stochastic linear quadratic optimal control problem is
studied, where the coefficients are allowed to be time-varying, and both state
delay and control delay can appear simultaneously in the state equation and the
cost functional. The closed-loop outcome control of this delayed problem is
given by a new Riccati system whose solvability is carefully established. To
this end, a novel method is introduced to transform the delayed problem into a
control problem driven by a stochastic Volterra integral system without delay.
This method offers several advantages: it bypasses the difficulty of decoupling
the forward delayed state equation and the backward anticipated adjoint
equation, avoids the introduction of infinite-dimensional spaces and unbounded
control operators, and ensures that the closed-loop outcome control depends
only on past state and control, without relying on future state or complex
conditional expectation calculations. Finally, several particular important
stochastic systems are discussed. It is found that the model can cover a class
of stochastic integro-differential systems, whose closed-loop solvability has
not been available before.

Conclusion: 该框架能够直接利用标准控制工具，为测度到测度传输提供样本高效的回归控制器，并为经典状态或集合稳定化提供新的去噪解释和方法。

Abstract: We develop a \emph{flow-matching framework} for transporting probability
measures under control-affine dynamics and for stabilizing systems to points or
target sets. Starting from the continuity equation associated with the control
affine system
  dx/dt = f_0(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m u_i f_i(x),
  we construct measure interpolations through exact and approximate flow
matching, and extend the approach to \emph{output flow matching} when only
output distributions must align. These constructions allow to directly import
standard control tools, such as feedback design, oscillatory inputs, and
trajectory steering, and yield sample-efficient, regression-based controllers
for measure-to-measure transport.
  We also introduce a complementary ``noising + time-reversal'' perspective for
classical state or set stabilization, inspired by denoising diffusion models.
Here stabilization is interpreted as a denoising problem. We propose two
methods for constructing the noising process: (i) PMP-based noising, which
leverages the Hamiltonian system from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and
recovers the optimal controller for linear systems with convex costs, while
providing feasible feedback laws in the nonlinear case; and (ii)
randomized-control noising, which employs regular (non-white noise) controls
through the endpoint map and naturally accommodates control constraints.
  Both approaches avoid the score blow-up seen in stochastic differential
equation-based denoising methods. We establish existence of solutions to the
corresponding ODEs and regularity of the induced flows on measures, even when
control laws are nonsmooth.
  Finally, we illustrate the framework on linear and nonlinear systems,
demonstrating its effectiveness for both measure transport and stabilization
problems.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the main algorithm behind a large body
of work in machine learning. In many cases, constraints are enforced via
projections, leading to projected stochastic gradient algorithms. In recent
years, a large body of work has examined the convergence properties of
projected SGD for non-convex losses in asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings.
Strong quantitative guarantees are available for convergence measured via
Moreau envelopes. However, these results cannot be compared directly with work
on unconstrained SGD, since the Moreau envelope construction changes the
gradient. Other common measures based on gradient mappings have the limitation
that convergence can only be guaranteed if variance reduction methods, such as
mini-batching, are employed. This paper presents an analysis of projected SGD
for non-convex losses over compact convex sets. Convergence is measured via the
distance of the gradient to the Goldstein subdifferential generated by the
constraints. Our proposed convergence criterion directly reduces to commonly
used criteria in the unconstrained case, and we obtain convergence without
requiring variance reduction. We obtain results for data that are independent,
identically distributed (IID) or satisfy mixing conditions ($L$-mixing). In
these cases, we derive asymptotic convergence and $O(N^{-1/3})$ non-asymptotic
bounds in expectation, where $N$ is the number of steps. In the case of IID
sub-Gaussian data, we obtain almost-sure asymptotic convergence and
high-probability non-asymptotic $O(N^{-1/5})$ bounds. In particular, these are
the first non-asymptotic high-probability bounds for projected SGD with
non-convex losses.

Conclusion: Wasserstein交叉算子能够有效解决传统进化算法在拓扑优化中的局限性，为处理难解拓扑优化问题提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are promising approaches for non-differentiable
or strongly multimodal topology optimization problems, but they often suffer
from the curse of dimensionality, generally leading to low-resolution optimized
results. This limitation stems in part from the difficulty of producing
effective offspring through traditional crossover operators, which struggle to
recombine complex parent design features in a meaningful way. In this study, we
propose a novel crossover operator for topology optimization, termed
Wasserstein crossover, and develop a corresponding EA-based optimization
framework. Our method leverages a morphing technique based on the Wasserstein
distance -- a distance metric between probability distributions derived from
the optimal transport theory. Its key idea is to treat material distributions
as probability distributions and generate offspring as Wasserstein barycenters,
enabling smooth and interpretable interpolation between parent designs while
preserving their structural features. The proposed framework incorporates
Wasserstein crossover into an EA under a multifidelity design scheme, where
low-fidelity optimized initial designs evolve through iterations of Wasserstein
crossover and selection based on high-fidelity evaluation. We apply the
proposed framework to three topology optimization problems: maximum stress
minimization in two- and three-dimensional structural mechanics, and turbulent
heat transfer in two-dimensional thermofluids. The results demonstrate that
candidate solutions evolve iteratively toward high-performance designs through
Wasserstein crossover, highlighting its potential as an effective crossover
operator and validating the usefulness of the proposed framework for solving
intractable topology optimization problems.

Conclusion: 联合优化投喂和收获决策能显著提高水产养殖利润，PINN方法为解决高维随机控制问题提供了可行的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper studies a joint stochastic optimal control and stopping (JCtrlOS)
problem motivated by aquaculture operations, where the objective is to maximize
farm profit through an optimal feeding strategy and harvesting time under
stochastic price dynamics. We introduce a simplified aquaculture model
capturing essential biological and economic features, distinguishing between
biologically optimal and economically optimal feeding strategies. The problem
is formulated as a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman variational inequality and
corresponding free boundary problem. We develop two numerical solution
approaches: First, a finite difference scheme that serves as a benchmark, and
second, a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-based method, combined with a
deep optimal stopping (DeepOS) algorithm to improve stopping time accuracy.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that while finite differences perform well in
medium-dimensional settings, the PINN approach achieves comparable accuracy and
is more scalable to higher dimensions where grid-based methods become
infeasible. The results confirm that jointly optimizing feeding and harvesting
decisions outperforms strategies that neglect either control or stopping.

Conclusion: 该割平面框架为大规模非凸二次规划提供了高效解决方案，无需分支定界即可获得接近最优解。

Abstract: We introduce a cutting-plane framework for nonconvex quadratic programs (QPs)
that progressively tightens convex relaxations. Our approach leverages the
doubly nonnegative (DNN) relaxation to compute strong lower bounds and generate
separating cuts, which are iteratively added to improve the relaxation. We
establish that, at any Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point satisfying a second-order
sufficient condition, a valid cut can be obtained by solving a linear
semidefinite program (SDP), and we devise a finite-termination local search
procedure to identify such points. Extensive computational experiments on both
benchmark and synthetic instances demonstrate that our approach yields tighter
bounds and consistently outperforms leading commercial and academic solvers in
terms of efficiency, robustness, and scalability. Notably, on a standard
desktop, our algorithm reduces the relative optimality gap to 0.01% on 138 out
of 140 instances of dimension 100 within one hour, without resorting to
branch-and-bound.

Conclusion: 随机Heavy Ball系统在噪声环境下具有鲁棒收敛性能，可有效处理优化和单调方程问题，且特定情况下等价于带消失阻尼的随机二阶动力系统，具有快速收敛特性。

Abstract: In a separable real Hilbert space, we study the problem of minimizing a
convex function with Lipschitz continuous gradient in the presence of noisy
evaluations. To this end, we associate a stochastic Heavy Ball system,
incorporating a friction coefficient, with the optimization problem. We
establish existence and uniqueness of trajectory solutions for this system.
Under a square integrability condition for the diffusion term, we prove almost
sure convergence of the trajectory process to an optimal solution, as well as
almost sure convergence of its time derivative to zero. Moreover, we derive
almost sure and expected convergence rates for the function values along the
trajectory towards the infimal value. Finally, we show that the stochastic
Heavy Ball system is equivalent to a Su-Boyd-Cand\`{e}s-type system for a
suitable choice of the parameter function, and we provide corresponding
convergence rate results for the latter.
  In the second part of this paper, we extend our analysis beyond the
optimization framework and investigate a monotone equation induced by a
monotone and Lipschitz continuous operator, whose evaluations are assumed to be
corrupted by noise. As before, we consider a stochastic Heavy Ball system with
a friction coefficient and a correction term, now augmented by an additional
component that accounts for the time derivative of the operator. We establish
analogous convergence results for both the trajectory process and its time
derivative, and derive almost sure as well as expected convergence rates for
the decay of the residual and the gap function along the trajectory. As a final
result, we show that a particular instance of the stochastic Heavy Ball system
for monotone equations is equivalent to a stochastic second-order dynamical
system with a vanishing damping term. Remarkably, this system exhibits fast
convergence rates for both the residual and gap functions.

Abstract: First-order optimization methods are crucial for solving large-scale data
processing problems, particularly those involving convex non-smooth composite
objectives. For such problems with convex non-smooth composite objectives, we
introduce a new class of generalized composite estimating sequences, devised by
exploiting the information embedded in the iterates generated during the
minimization process. Building on these sequences, we propose a novel
accelerated first-order method tailored for such objective structures. This
method features a backtracking line-search strategy and achieves an accelerated
convergence rate, regardless of whether the true Lipschitz constant is known.
Additionally, it exhibits robustness to imperfect knowledge of the strong
convexity parameter, a property of significant practical importance. The
method's efficiency and robustness are substantiated by comprehensive numerical
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in data processing applications.

Motivation: 尽管分支割平面法在实践中成功解决了混合整数双层线性规划问题，但在理论和实践方面仍存在空白，需要建立与混合整数线性规划(MILP)平行的基本理论框架。

Method: 第一部分建立了MIBLPs有效不等式和割平面方法的基本理论，提供了分类方案；第二部分评估了这些有效不等式的计算有效性，并讨论了将MIBLP有效不等式动态生成方法集成到MILP分支割平面算法中的挑战。

Result: 证明了开源求解器MibS 1.2版本通过多种改进，其性能相比1.1版本得到了显著提升。

Conclusion: 虽然MIBLP的分支割平面方法在原理上是MILP方法的直接推广，但存在微妙而重要的差异，需要在控制机制和算法细节上进行适当修改以确保性能。

Abstract: Despite the success of branch-and-cut methods for solving mixed integer
bilevel linear optimization problems (MIBLPs) in practice, there are still gaps
in both the theory and practice surrounding these methods. In the first part of
this paper, we lay out a basic theory of valid inequalities and cutting-plane
methods for MIBLPs that parallels the existing theory for mixed integer linear
optimization problems (MILPs). We provide a general scheme for classifying
valid inequalities and illustrate how the known classes of valid inequalities
fit into this categorization, as well as generalizing several existing classes.
  In the second part of the paper, we assess the computational effectiveness of
these valid inequalities and discuss the myriad challenges that arise in
integrating methods of dynamically generating inequalities valid for MIBLPs
into a branch-and-cut algorithms originally designed for solving MILPs.
Although branch-and-cut methods for solving for MIBLPs are in principle
straightforward generalizations of those used for MILP, there are subtle but
important differences and there remain many unanswered questions regarding how
to suitably modify control mechanisms and other algorithmic details in order to
ensure performance in the MIBLP setting. We demonstrate that performance of
version 1.2 of the open-source solver MibS was substantially improved over that
of version 1.1 through a variety of improvements to the previous
implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的最优平均次梯度下降方法在存在对抗性扰动时性能会二次下降，需要开发对扰动更鲁棒的新方法。

Method: 使用性能优化编程构造了三种新的次梯度下降方法，并提出了一个关于最坏情况次优性间隙的新下界。

Result: 提出的三种方法在最坏情况下的性能仅随腐败预算线性下降，且与下界的相对差异以O(log(N)/N)衰减，证明是近似最优的。

Conclusion: 在对抗性扰动环境下，无需动量或平均技术即可实现近似最优性能，这与近期研究结果一致。

Abstract: We consider minimizing nonsmooth convex functions with bounded subgradients.
However, instead of directly observing a subgradient at every step $k\in [0,
\dots, N-1]$, we assume that the optimizer receives an adversarially corrupted
subgradient. The adversary's power is limited to a finite corruption budget,
but allows the adversary to strategically time its perturbations. We show that
the classical averaged subgradient descent method, which is optimal in the
noiseless case, has worst-case performance that deteriorates quadratically with
the corruption budget. Using performance optimization programming, (i) we
construct and analyze the performance of three novel subgradient descent
methods, and (ii) propose a novel lower bound on the worst-case suboptimality
gap of any first-order method satisfying a mild cone condition proposed by
Fatkhullin et al. (2025). The worst-case performance of each of our methods
degrades only linearly with the corruption budget. Furthermore, we show that
the relative difference between their worst-case suboptimality gap and our
lower bound decays as $\mathcal O(\log(N)/N)$, so that all three proposed
subgradient descent methods are near-optimal. Our methods achieve such
near-optimal performance without a need for momentum or averaging. This
suggests that these techniques are not necessary in this context, which is in
line with recent results by Zamani and Glineur (2025).

coefficients. In [Ghasemi-Marshal], Ghasemi and Marshall give an algorithm,
based on geometric programming, which computes a lower bound for $f$ on
$\mathbb{R}^n$. In [Ghasemi-Lasserre-Marshall] Ghasemi, Lasserre and Marshall
show how the algorithm in [Ghasemi-Marshal] can be modified to compute a lower
bound for $f$ on the hyperellipsoid $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^d \le M.$ Here $d$ is a
fixed even integer, $d \ge \max\{ 2, \deg(f)\}$ and $M$ is a fixed positive
real number. Suppose now that $g_j := 1-\sum_{i\in I_j} (\frac{x_i}{N_i})^d$,
$j=1,\dots,m$, where $d$ is a fixed even integer $d \ge \max\{ 2, \deg(f)\}$,
$N_i$ is a fixed positive real number, $i=1,\dots,n$ and $I_1,\dots, I_m$ is a
fixed partition of $\{ 1,\dots,n\}$. The present paper gives an algorithm based
on geometric programming for computing a lower bound for $f$ on the subset of
$\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by the inequalities $g_j\ge 0$, $j=1,\dots,m$. The
algorithm is implemented in a SAGE program developed by the first author. The
bound obtained is typically not as sharp as the bound obtained using
semidefinite programming, but it has the advantage that it is computable
rapidly, even in cases where the bound obtained by semidefinite programming is
not computable. When $m=1$ and $N_i = \root d \of{M}$, $i=1,\dots,n$ the
algorithm produces the lower bound obtained in [Ghasemi-Lasserre-Marshall].
When $m=n$ and $I_j = \{ j \}$, $j=1,\dots,n$ the algorithm produces a lower
bound for $f$ on the hypercube $\prod_{i=1}^n [-N_i,N_i]$, which in certain
cases can be computed by a simple formula.

### [43] [Improving Online-to-Nonconvex Conversion for Smooth Optimization via Double Optimism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03167)
*Francisco Patitucci,Ruichen Jiang,Aryan Mokhtari*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于双重乐观提示函数的在线乐观梯度方法，改进了非凸优化的在线到非凸转换框架，消除了双循环结构和对数因子，并在确定性情况下达到O(ε^{-1.75})复杂度，在随机情况下达到O(ε^{-1.75} + σ²ε^{-3.5})复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线到非凸转换框架存在三个主要问题：(i)确定性方法需要复杂的双循环结构来构造提示向量，引入了额外的对数因子；(ii)随机方法需要更强的二阶矩有界假设；(iii)两种设置需要使用不同的在线学习算法。

Method: 提出基于双重乐观提示函数的在线乐观梯度方法，使用外推点的梯度作为提示，基于两个乐观假设：提示与目标梯度之差保持近似恒定，以及由于平滑性连续更新方向变化缓慢。

Result: 新方法消除了双循环需求和对数因子，在确定性情况下复杂度为O(ε^{-1.75})，在随机情况下复杂度为O(ε^{-1.75} + σ²ε^{-3.5})，统一了两种设置的最佳复杂度。

Conclusion: 所提出的双重乐观提示方法提供了一个统一、简化的框架，在保持最优复杂度的同时解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: A recent breakthrough in nonconvex optimization is the online-to-nonconvex
conversion framework of \cite{cutkosky2023optimal}, which reformulates the task
of finding an $\varepsilon$-first-order stationary point as an online learning
problem. When both the gradient and the Hessian are Lipschitz continuous,
instantiating this framework with two different online learners achieves a
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1.75}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ in the
deterministic case and a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3.5})$ in the
stochastic case. However, this approach suffers from several limitations: (i)
the deterministic method relies on a complex double-loop scheme that solves a
fixed-point equation to construct hint vectors for an optimistic online
learner, introducing an extra logarithmic factor; (ii) the stochastic method
assumes a bounded second-order moment of the stochastic gradient, which is
stronger than standard variance bounds; and (iii) different online learning
algorithms are used in the two settings. In this paper, we address these issues
by introducing an online optimistic gradient method based on a novel
\textit{doubly optimistic hint function}. Specifically, we use the gradient at
an extrapolated point as the hint, motivated by two optimistic assumptions:
that the difference between the hint and the target gradient remains near
constant, and that consecutive update directions change slowly due to
smoothness. Our method eliminates the need for a double loop and removes the
logarithmic factor. Furthermore, by simply replacing full gradients with
stochastic gradients and under the standard assumption that their variance is
bounded by $\sigma^2$, we obtain a unified algorithm with complexity
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1.75} + \sigma^2 \varepsilon^{-3.5})$, smoothly
interpolating between the best-known deterministic rate and the optimal
stochastic rate.

TL;DR: ProxSTORM：一种随机信赖域算法，用于最小化可能非凸的Lipschitz光滑函数（只能随机评估）与非光滑、确定性凸函数之和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推广STORM算法和确定性近端信赖域算法，处理包含非光滑凸项的随机优化问题，简化假设条件并扩展应用范围。

Method: 基于STORM框架，使用鞅理论进行分析，结合随机信赖域方法和近端算子处理非光滑项，简化了某些证明步骤。

Result: 证明了算法的全局收敛性和期望复杂度界限，在更一般的包含非光滑项的情况下保持了理论保证。

Conclusion: ProxSTORM算法在理论上具有收敛保证，并在ℓ¹正则化神经网络训练和拓扑优化等实际应用中表现出数值可行性。

Abstract: We develop a stochastic trust-region algorithm for minimizing the sum of a
possibly nonconvex Lipschitz-smooth function that can only be evaluated
stochastically and a nonsmooth, deterministic, convex function. This algorithm,
which we call ProxSTORM, generalizes STORM [1, 2] -- a stochastic trust-region
algorithm for the unconstrained optimization of smooth functions -- and the
inexact deterministic proximal trust-region algorithm in [3]. We generalize
and, in some cases, simplify problem assumptions so that they reduce to more
succinct version of assumptions on STORM when the convex term is zero. Our
analysis follows the STORM framework by employing martingales, but again
simplifies certain steps and proving global convergence and an expected
complexity bound in the more general setting of a possibly nonsmooth term. To
demonstrate that the method is numerically viable, we apply the algorithm to
$\ell^1$-regularized neural network training and also to topology optimization.

*Junru Hua,Rahul Ahluwalia,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于极值预测的数据增强框架，结合GANs和SMOTE等数据增强方法与深度学习模型（Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM），通过基于相关函数的策略来提升极值预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极值预测在金融和气候变化等领域具有重要应用价值，但面临数据不平衡的挑战。传统数据增强方法主要针对模式分类和计算机视觉应用，需要专门针对极值预测的数据增强框架。

Method: 使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步预测，结合GANs和SMOTE等数据增强方法，并提出了基于相关函数的极值数据增强策略。

Result: SMOTE-based策略在短期和长期预测中均表现出更好的适应性，Conv-LSTM在周期性稳定数据集中表现优异，而BD-LSTM在混沌或非平稳序列中表现更好。

Conclusion: 数据增强方法能有效提升极值预测性能，不同模型在不同数据类型下具有互补优势，SMOTE方法在极值预测中具有较好的适应性。

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

TL;DR: OpenTSLM是一个时间序列语言模型家族，通过将时间序列作为原生模态集成到预训练LLMs中，解决了LLMs无法处理时间序列的局限性。该研究提出了两种架构：SoftPrompt（隐式建模）和Flamingo（显式建模），在多个医疗时间序列推理任务上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗领域具有巨大潜力，但无法处理时间序列数据是一个主要限制。为了克服这一差距，需要开发能够原生处理时间序列的模型。

Method: 提出了两种架构：OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt通过可学习的时间序列token与文本token拼接进行隐式建模；OpenTSLM-Flamingo通过交叉注意力机制显式集成时间序列和文本。在三个医疗时间序列推理数据集上进行评估。

Result: OpenTSLM模型在所有任务上都优于基线方法，在睡眠分期任务达到69.9 F1，在HAR任务达到65.4 F1，显著优于仅文本微调模型（9.05和52.2）。即使是1B参数的OpenTSLM也超过了GPT-4o的表现。Flamingo版本在长序列上表现更好且内存需求稳定。

Conclusion: OpenTSLM成功地将时间序列作为原生模态集成到LLMs中，在医疗时间序列推理任务上表现出色。显式建模方法在性能和内存效率方面优于隐式方法，为医疗AI应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainSeer是一个结构感知的降雨场重建框架，利用雷达反射率作为物理结构先验，通过两阶段架构解决雷达体积场到地面降雨的转换问题，显著提升了降雨场重建的结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间插值方法在重建高分辨率降雨场时往往过度平滑，无法捕捉尖锐过渡和局域极值，导致关键结构丢失。

Method: 采用物理信息驱动的两阶段架构：结构到点映射器进行空间对齐，将中尺度雷达结构投影到局域地面降雨；地理感知降雨解码器通过因果时空注意力机制捕捉水凝物下降过程中的语义转换。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的评估显示，相比最先进基线方法，MAE降低了13.31%以上，重建降雨场的结构保真度显著提升。

Conclusion: RainSeer通过将雷达反射率重新解释为物理结构先验，有效解决了降雨场重建中的结构保持问题，为洪水预报和水文建模提供了更准确的输入数据。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

TL;DR: Advisor Models是一种轻量级参数化策略，通过强化学习训练，能够对黑盒模型进行动态的自然语言引导，相比静态提示优化方法有更好的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型作为黑盒服务部署时，模型权重无法修改，定制化仅限于提示。静态提示优化方法产生的固定提示无法适应不同输入、用户或环境的变化。

Method: 使用强化学习训练轻量级参数化策略（Advisor Models），在输入和模型之间插入一个小型模型，根据环境奖励信号对每个实例进行行为塑造。

Result: 在涉及推理和个性化的多个领域中，Advisor Models优于静态提示优化器，能够发现环境动态并提高下游任务性能。同时展示了在不同黑盒模型间的可迁移性，以及在保持对分布外输入鲁棒性的同时实现专业化的能力。

Conclusion: Advisor Models为黑盒系统提供了可学习的接口，其中顾问充当参数化、环境特定的记忆。通过Advisor Models对黑盒模型进行动态优化是实现个性化和环境自适应AI的有前景方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出基于预测市场的训练数据选择方法，通过市场机制统一多种效用信号，使用单一流动性参数控制数据集中度，在固定计算预算下实现多信号数据筛选的统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练数据选择方法面临多种效用信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等）难以统一整合的问题，通常需要人工设定权重，缺乏系统性和透明度。

Method: 使用成本函数预测市场（LMSR）为每个训练样本定价，信号作为交易者，通过单一流动性参数控制数据集中度，采用主题归一化稳定校准，并引入价格每令牌规则处理令牌预算问题。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上（60k令牌预算），市场方法在保持与强单信号基线相当性能的同时，减少了种子方差，选择开销小于0.1 GPU小时；在AGNews数据集上（保留5-25%数据），市场方法在保持竞争力的准确率同时提高了平衡性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为固定计算预算下的多信号数据筛选提供了统一解决方案，适用于提示级推理和分类任务，实现了透明可控的数据选择机制。

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

Conclusion: SAGE提供了一种实用的恒定内存替代方案，补充了剪枝和模型压缩，实现高效训练。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在缺乏真实标签情况下如何为集成学习选择最佳模型的问题，利用模型不确定性作为选择标准

Method: 使用TabPFN模型和简单序列特征，通过预测的inter-quantile range(IQR)衡量不确定性，选择不确定性最低的模型进行集成

Result: 在siRNA敲低效能任务中，TabPFN超越专业SOTA预测器，模型IQR与真实预测误差呈负相关，基于IQR的集成方法优于朴素集成或单一模型

Conclusion: 模型不确定性是优化生物分子效能预测的强大无标签启发式方法

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分解方法假设已知分解表示，而深度强化学习无法利用分解结构。需要一种能从高维观测中自动发现可控制因子的方法。

Method: 使用对比学习方法，利用动作稀疏性（每个动作通常只影响变量子集）来识别可独立控制的潜在变量。

Result: 在Taxi、FourRooms和MiniGrid-DoorKey三个基准测试上，ACF直接从像素观测中恢复了真实的可控制因子，在解纠缠算法中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ACF能够有效从高维观测中发现可独立控制的潜在变量，为强化学习中的表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

Method: 将DRL和有界ES结合形成混合控制器，DRL利用历史数据快速控制多参数系统，有界ES确保对时变性的鲁棒性。

Result: 混合控制器的性能超过了单独使用两种方法的效果，在洛斯阿拉莫斯中子科学中心线性粒子加速器的低能束流传输段自动调谐中进行了数值研究。

Conclusion: DRL和有界ES的结合产生了协同效应，既保持了DRL的快速学习能力，又增强了系统对时变性的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

*Jiangnan Li,Thuy-Trang Vu,Ehsan Abbasnejad,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了监督微调(SFT)与逆强化学习的等价关系，证明SFT不仅学习策略，还学习隐式的密集奖励模型，并提出了从SFT模型中提取密集奖励信号的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上SFT被视为简单的模仿学习过程，本文挑战这一观点，旨在证明SFT实际上是一种强大的奖励学习机制。

Method: 建立了SFT与逆Q学习的等价关系，提出了基线相对奖励函数来从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号，并开发了Dense-Path REINFORCE方法。

Result: Dense-Path REINFORCE方法在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于原始SFT模型。

Conclusion: SFT不仅是策略模仿，更是一种强大的奖励学习机制，为利用专家演示开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差学习框架，通过在多块交叉阵列上顺序学习来补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差，从而在有限状态设备上实现片上训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟内存计算加速器使用电阻交叉阵列直接在内存中进行深度神经网络计算，但有效的内存训练通常需要至少8位电导状态才能匹配数字基线。实际上，许多有前景的忆阻器件（如ReRAM）由于制造限制只能提供约4位分辨率，这种有限的更新精度会显著降低训练精度。

Method: 提出残差学习框架，在多块交叉阵列瓦片上顺序学习，补偿低精度权重更新产生的残差误差。理论分析表明最优性差距随瓦片数量增加而缩小，并实现线性收敛速率。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在有限状态设置下始终优于最先进的模拟内存训练策略，成本分析确认只带来适度的硬件开销。

Conclusion: 残差学习框架能够有效解决有限状态忆阻器件的训练精度问题，为片上训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

TL;DR: SFMG是一种基于谱几何和流匹配的图生成新方法，通过谱嵌入将图映射到黎曼流形，然后沿测地线流匹配分布来生成图，在保持性能的同时实现了30倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图生成方法通常只对齐目标图的谱或度分布，但忽略了特征向量诱导的几何结构和图的全局结构。

Method: 使用谱特征映射将输入图和目标图嵌入到连续黎曼流形中，定义嵌入之间的测地线流，并沿这些流匹配分布来生成输出图。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，SFMG在图元、度和谱指标上与最先进方法性能相当，同时比基于扩散的模型快30倍，并能泛化到未见过的图规模。

Conclusion: SFMG通过将谱几何与流匹配相结合，为图合成提供了一种新方法，在捕获几何结构、灵活生成和高效扩展方面具有优势。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于动物间变换类(IATC)的模型-大脑比较方法，通过双向映射评估神经网络模型是否能像典型受试者一样表现，解决了模型预测性与机制识别之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏共识的方法来比较模型激活与大脑响应，需要一种能够同时实现高预测性和机制识别准确性的比较方法。

Method: 使用IATC方法，通过识别动物群体中准确映射神经响应所需的最严格函数集，在模型响应和大脑数据之间进行双向映射评估。

Result: IATC能够解析神经机制的详细方面（如非线性激活函数），实现神经活动准确预测，同时在不同脑区响应模式分离和相同脑区响应对齐方面表现出高特异性。

Conclusion: IATC证明了模型预测性和机制识别准确性之间不存在固有权衡，为模型-大脑比较提供了原则性方法，支持地形深度神经网络作为视觉系统模型。

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

Motivation: 开发一个能够同时学习时序行为特征、预测抑郁结果并识别行为亚型的统一模型，以提供临床可解释的风险分析。

Method: 使用注意力GRU自编码器联合优化三个目标：序列重构学习紧凑潜在表示、二元分类预测抑郁率、GMM软聚类识别行为亚型。

Result: 在372名参与者的睡眠数据上，聚类质量（轮廓分数0.70 vs 0.32-0.70）和抑郁分类（AUC 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67）均优于基线；在332名参与者的外部验证中保持稳定（轮廓分数0.63，AUC 0.61）。

Conclusion: AttentiveGRUAE能够有效识别行为亚型并提供临床可解释的风险解释，通过可视化时间注意力机制揭示与睡眠规律变化相关的关键时间窗口。

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图神经网络(GNNs)取得了显著进展，但其有限的表达能力仍然是一个基本挑战。目前尚未探索使用导数来增强GNN表达能力的可能性。

Method: 引入高阶导数GNN(HOD-GNN)，利用基础模型的高阶节点导数生成表达性结构感知节点嵌入，通过第二个GNN在端到端可训练架构中处理。

Result: 理论证明HOD-GNN的表达能力与WL层次结构对齐，并在流行的图学习基准测试中表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: 高阶节点导数提供了一种增强GNN表达能力的自然方式，HOD-GNN在表达能力和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have been supported by the emergence of
domain-specific software libraries, enabling streamlined workflows and
increased reproducibility. For geospatial machine learning (GeoML), the
availability of Earth observation data has outpaced the development of domain
libraries to handle its unique challenges, such as varying spatial resolutions,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标网络方法虽然稳定但学习速度慢，而直接使用在线网络作为目标会导致学习不稳定。MINTO旨在结合两者的优点。

Method: 引入新的更新规则，使用目标网络和在线网络的最小值估计来计算目标值，这种方法可以无缝集成到各种基于值和actor-critic算法中。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，包括在线和离线RL、离散和连续动作空间，MINTO始终提升性能表现。

Conclusion: MINTO通过简单有效的修改实现了更快更稳定的值函数学习，具有广泛的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该研究强调了理论指导、物理基础的大样本水文学方法的潜力，重点关注机制理解和开发简约可解释的模型架构，为未来能够编码空间和时间变化过程主导性信息的"无处不在"模型奠定基础。

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

Motivation: 现有的车载桥梁检测方法中，车辆的机械和动态特性显著影响损伤检测性能，限制了该方法的有效性。

Method: 使用基于对抗自编码器的无监督深度学习方法重建加速度响应的频域表示，通过最小化健康与损伤状态下损伤指数分布的Wasserstein距离来优化车辆参数，并采用Kriging元模型高效近似目标函数。

Result: 结果显示，相对于桥梁第一固有频率，频率比在0.3-0.7之间的车辆检测效果最佳，而接近共振的车辆表现较差。较轻的车辆需要较低的固有频率以获得最佳检测效果。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统优化车载传感平台的研究，提出了专用检测车辆的设计方案。

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency- domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

Motivation: 现有特征筛选方法依赖统计成对依赖度量来建模特征-目标关系，但当目标依赖于高阶特征交互而非个体贡献时，这种方法可能失效。

Conclusion: MINERVA方法能够有效处理传统方法难以捕捉的高阶特征交互依赖，在特征选择任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习率预热已成为深度学习的普遍启发式方法，但其理论基础仍不明确，需要从原理上解释为什么预热能改善训练效果。

Method: 基于广义(L0,L1)-平滑度条件，该条件将局部曲率建模为损失次优性的线性函数，并证明了该条件在常见神经网络架构中成立。在此假设下，分析了预热调度下梯度下降的收敛性。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证都表明，在广义平滑度条件下，采用预热调度的梯度下降比固定步长收敛更快，建立了上下复杂度界限。

Conclusion: 预热调度在理论和实践中都被证明能有效加速训练收敛，为这一常用启发式方法提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions
range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks.
However, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and
time-consuming hyperparameter tuning, no default imputation method exists.
Building on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning,
we propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast
zero-shot imputations requiring no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at
inference-time. To train and evaluate TabImpute, we introduce (i) an entry-wise
featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over
the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data
generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts

TL;DR: HyperAdaLoRA通过引入基于注意力机制的hypernetwork来动态生成SVD参数，解决了AdaLoRA收敛慢和计算开销大的问题，实现了更快的收敛速度且不牺牲性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdaLoRA虽然通过SVD和奇异值剪枝实现了动态秩分配，但在训练过程中存在收敛速度慢和计算开销高的问题。

Method: 使用基于注意力机制的hypernetwork动态生成SVD参数(P, Λ, Q)，通过对生成奇异值的hypernetwork输出进行剪枝来实现动态秩分配。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验表明，该方法实现了更快的收敛速度且不牺牲性能，在其他基于LoRA的方法上的扩展实验验证了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA通过hypernetwork机制有效加速了AdaLoRA的收敛，为参数高效微调提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

*Fumin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs)，通过结合乘法部分和加法部分，在保持可解释性的同时显著提升了预测性能，超越了CESR和GAMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗保健中，机器学习模型的可解释性至关重要。GAMs虽然可解释但忽略了高阶交互效应，CESR包含所有特征交互但性能不佳，需要一种既保持可解释性又提升性能的方法。

Method: 引入MACMs模型，包含乘法部分和加法部分。乘法部分基于CESR，加法部分用于解耦交互项和独立项的系数，扩展了假设空间。两个部分的形状函数都可以可视化，帮助用户理解特征在决策过程中的作用。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和当前最先进的GAMs。

Conclusion: MACMs在保持可解释性的同时，通过结合乘法交互和加法独立效应，有效提升了预测性能，为高风险领域提供了更好的可解释机器学习解决方案。

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

TL;DR: TutorBench是一个用于评估LLM辅导能力的基准数据集，包含1,490个专家标注样本，涵盖自适应解释、反馈提供和提示生成三个核心辅导任务。评估16个前沿LLM发现，所有模型得分均低于56%，表明现有模型在辅导技能方面仍有很大改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学生越来越多地使用LLM作为学习辅助工具，需要开发能够理解学生核心需求、具有适应性、提供个性化指导且准确的辅导模型。

Method: 构建包含1,490个高中和AP课程样本的数据集，涵盖三个辅导任务：自适应解释、反馈提供和提示生成。使用样本特定评分标准和LLM评判器进行自动评估。

Result: 评估16个前沿LLM，所有模型得分均低于56%。Claude模型在支持主动学习方面表现最佳，但在其他两个用例中落后。所有模型在指导、诊断和支持学生方面的评分标准通过率均低于60%。

Conclusion: 现有LLM在展现完整辅导技能方面存在不足，TutorBench为开发下一代AI导师提供了全面且未饱和的基准。

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

TL;DR: 论文证明对于一类置换等变学习规则，训练过程在神经元间诱导出双Lipschitz映射，约束神经元分布的拓扑结构。学习率存在临界点η*：低于η*时保持拓扑结构，高于η*时允许拓扑简化，降低模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究梯度下降中神经元网络的拓扑演化规律，揭示学习率对拓扑结构的影响，为深度学习提供统一的拓扑分析方法。

Method: 通过分析置换等变学习规则（包括SGD、Adam等）在训练过程中诱导的神经元间映射关系，建立拓扑约束理论框架。

Result: 发现学习率临界点η*：小学习率保持拓扑结构，大学习率允许拓扑简化；训练过程分为两个阶段：平滑优化阶段和拓扑简化阶段。

Conclusion: 该理论独立于具体架构和损失函数，为深度学习研究提供了通用的拓扑分析方法，揭示了神经元网络训练的本质特征。

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI模型参数规模达到数千亿级别，低精度计算对于高效部署变得不可或缺。论文旨在开发低精度浮点格式，以提供数值稳定性、内存节省和硬件效率，同时避免反量化开销。

Method: 通过理论和实证研究揭示了GenAI权重中的指数集中现象，证明这种现象源于随机梯度下降诱导的α稳定分布。基于此设计了ECF8格式，包含熵感知编码和GPU优化的解码框架。

Conclusion: 指数集中现象是训练模型的一个统计规律，为FP8时代的无损低精度浮点设计开辟了原则性路径。

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

Conclusion: 通过结合GP的符号推理能力和LLM的解释生成能力，EvoSpeak推动了智能、透明、用户对齐的启发式开发。

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GRAFT框架，将RAFT变体统一为GRAFT，并证明其隐式执行带有重塑奖励的PPO。然后引入P-GRAFT在中间噪声级别塑造分布，并通过偏差-方差权衡进行数学解释。还提出了无需显式奖励的逆噪声校正来改进流模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型能有效捕捉训练数据分布，但需要根据下游应用使用奖励函数来塑造这些分布。虽然PPO等方法在自回归生成中广泛使用，但扩散模型的边际似然难以处理，需要替代方案。

Method: 1. 将RAFT变体统一为GRAFT框架；2. 引入P-GRAFT在中间噪声级别进行分布塑造；3. 提出逆噪声校正改进流模型；4. 在文本到图像生成、布局生成、分子生成和无条件图像生成等任务上进行评估。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 2上，该框架在流行的T2I基准测试中优于策略梯度方法，VQAScore显示相对于基础模型有8.81%的相对改进。对于无条件图像生成，逆噪声校正在较低FLOPs/图像的情况下改善了生成图像的FID。

Conclusion: GRAFT框架有效解决了扩散模型分布塑造问题，P-GRAFT通过中间噪声级别优化提供了更有效的微调，逆噪声校正为流模型改进提供了新途径，在多个生成任务上取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

Result: 在大多数Stochastic-D4RL任务上，RAMAC在保持强回报的同时，在CVaR0.1指标上获得一致提升。

Conclusion: RAMAC框架成功解决了离线强化学习中风险规避与策略表达性之间的权衡问题，为安全关键应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

*Tianxiang Zhao,Youqing Wang,Jinlu Wang,Jiapu Wang,Mingliang Cui,Junbin Gao,Jipeng Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的鲁棒属性图聚类方法RAGC，通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知来解决现有CAGC方法在边级嵌入增强和对比样本处理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比属性图聚类方法主要依赖边作为辅助信息获取节点级嵌入表示，仅关注节点级嵌入增强，忽视了边级嵌入增强以及不同粒度下节点级和边级嵌入增强之间的交互作用。同时，它们往往平等对待所有对比样本对，忽略了难易正负样本对之间的显著差异，限制了判别能力。

Method: RAGC方法包含两个核心模块：1) 混合协作增强(HCA)：同时执行节点级和边级嵌入表示与增强，建立更全面的相似性度量标准；2) 对比样本自适应差分感知(CSADA)：利用高置信度伪标签信息，自适应识别所有对比样本对并通过创新的权重调制函数进行差异化处理。两个模块在良性循环中相互促进。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的综合图聚类评估表明，所提出的RAGC方法在多个最先进的CAGC方法中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: RAGC通过同时考虑节点级和边级嵌入增强，以及自适应差异化处理对比样本对，显著提升了表示学习的判别能力，在属性图聚类任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TokenFlow是一个新颖的LLM服务系统，通过抢占式请求调度和主动KV缓存管理来提升文本流性能，在保持整体token吞吐量的同时，显著提高了有效吞吐量并降低了响应延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时LLM交互需要流式token生成，但现有系统由于非抢占式请求调度和被动内存管理导致资源利用率低、请求处理并行度差，特别是在请求突发时表现不佳。

Method: TokenFlow采用动态优先级调度（基于token缓冲区占用率和消费速率），并主动在GPU和CPU内存间传输KV缓存，同时重叠I/O与计算以最小化抢占开销。

Result: 在Llama3-8B和Qwen2.5-32B模型上的实验表明，TokenFlow实现了高达82.5%的有效吞吐量提升，P99 TTFT降低达80.2%，且不损害整体token吞吐量。

Conclusion: TokenFlow通过创新的调度和缓存管理机制，显著提升了LLM服务的流式性能，为实时交互应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and
mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor
satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS,
MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our
framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products
without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs
self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable
classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern
California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton,
Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This
work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while
enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step
toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic
biogeochemistry.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了生物神经网络是否使用类似梯度下降的学习策略，发现非梯度的"旋度"组件可以在保持有效优化的同时存在于学习动态中，这些旋度项在具有抑制-兴奋连接性或Hebbian/反Hebbian可塑性的网络中自然出现。


<details>

Motivation: 研究生物神经网络是否使用梯度下降策略进行学习，以及非梯度学习动态如何影响优化过程，挑战传统的基于梯度的学习理论。

Method: 在前馈网络中使用学生-教师框架进行分析，通过规则翻转可塑性的神经元系统性地引入非梯度动态，研究旋度项对学习动态的影响。

Result: 小旋度项保持原始解流形的稳定性，学习动态类似梯度下降；超过临界值后，强旋度项会破坏解流形稳定性，可能导致混沌学习动态或意外地加速学习。

Conclusion: 某些特定架构能够通过多样化的学习规则支持稳健学习，为神经网络中基于梯度的学习理论提供了重要补充。

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的在线共形预测方法，通过使用更广泛的函数类别来量化预测区间的相关性，而不是传统的二元评估，从而产生更窄的预测区间同时保持覆盖有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线共形预测方法在阈值更新步骤中只关注预测区间的有效性（真值是否在区间内），而忽略了区间的相关性。本文旨在利用这一被忽视的方面来改进方法。

Method: 提出在阈值更新步骤中用更广泛的函数类别替换二元评估（内部/外部），这些函数使用真值来量化预测区间的相关性，有助于防止阈值突变，可能产生更窄的预测区间。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，这些函数可以产生比现有OCP方法更紧的区间，同时保持覆盖有效性。

Conclusion: 通过量化预测区间相关性的函数来增强阈值更新步骤，能够产生更窄的预测区间，同时维持覆盖保证，改进了现有的在线共形预测方法。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

Method: 使用模型消融技术移除拒绝敏感方向，在SmolLM2-1.7B的20个系统上进行控制评估，通过100个平衡的有害和无害提示测试，使用多个评判者分类响应为拒绝或非拒绝。

Result: 研究产生了检查点级别的特征描述，量化了评判者选择对评估结果的影响，并提出了将推理时编辑整合到安全评估中的实用协议。

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

Motivation: LLM推理在全球范围内持续进行，已成为AI能源消耗的主要来源，但现有研究缺乏细粒度测量方法，仅报告粗粒度的模型级指标，将能效视为次要考虑因素。

Method: 提出CLEAR方法（Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling），通过重复采样克服微秒级组件执行与毫秒级能耗传感器监测之间的时间不匹配问题，评估了涵盖四种架构类型的15个模型。

Result: 组件级能耗方差始终低于9.5%，捕获了模型总能耗的90%以上；Attention块每FLOP消耗的能量显著更多，表明能耗与FLOP计数不成比例，FLOPs无法准确反映组件级真实能耗成本。

Conclusion: 建立了详细的组件级能耗基准，为通过组件级优化构建节能transformer模型提供了初步见解和基础。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

Conclusion: 梯度下降方法在深度ReLU网络中可实现接近最优的泛化性能，且仅对网络深度呈多项式依赖。

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

TL;DR: DMark是首个专门为扩散大语言模型设计的数字水印框架，通过预测性水印、双向水印和预测-双向水印三种策略，解决传统水印方法在非自回归模型上的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型相比自回归模型生成速度更快且质量相当，但现有水印方法因其非顺序解码特性而失效。传统水印基于因果设计，而dLLMs可以任意顺序生成token，破坏了这种设计基础。

Method: DMark采用三种互补策略：预测性水印（在缺乏实际上下文时使用模型预测的token）、双向水印（利用扩散解码特有的前后向依赖关系）、预测-双向水印（结合前两种方法最大化检测强度）。

Result: 在多个dLLMs上的实验表明，DMark在1%误报率下达到92.0-99.5%的检测率，同时保持文本质量，而现有方法简单适配后只有49.6-71.2%的检测率。DMark还对文本操作具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DMark证明了对于非自回归语言模型，有效的数字水印是可行的，为非顺序解码模型的版权保护提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

Conclusion: 本文成功将风险度量理论扩展到持续强化学习领域，提出的遍历风险度量为风险感知持续学习提供了兼容且有效的理论框架。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

*Sung Ho Jo,Seonghwi Kim,Minwoo Chae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种层次化Group DRO方法，解决传统方法对组内分布偏移的脆弱性问题，特别是在样本有限的少数群体中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法容易受到伪相关性的影响，特别是在测试数据分布偏移时。现有方法如Group DRO虽然对组间偏移具有鲁棒性，但对组内分布偏移仍然脆弱，这在样本有限的少数群体中尤为常见。

Method: 提出了Group DRO的层次化扩展，同时处理组间和组内不确定性，在多个层次上提供对分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Result: 在新设计的模拟现实少数群体分布偏移的基准测试中，该方法表现出强大的鲁棒性，而现有鲁棒学习方法在这些条件下持续失败。同时在标准基准测试中也取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明，扩大模糊集以更好地捕捉组间和组内分布不确定性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于迁移学习的方法，使用高频数据预训练模型，然后用低频午报数据微调，以预测船舶轴功率，在姊妹船、相似船和不同船上均降低了预测误差。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球海运增长，能源优化对降低成本和提高运营效率至关重要。轴功率直接影响燃料消耗，但高质量传感器数据获取困难且成本高，午报数据成为可行替代方案。

Method: 采用迁移学习方法，先在船舶高频数据上训练模型，然后用其他船舶的低频每日午报数据进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，与仅使用午报数据训练的模型相比，该方法在姊妹船上平均绝对百分比误差降低10.6%，在相似船上降低3.6%，在不同船上降低5.3%。

Conclusion: 迁移学习方法能有效利用高频数据提升低频午报数据的轴功率预测精度，在不同类型船舶上均取得显著改进。

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Conclusion: 提出的通用模板有效解决了随机顺序模型中的非平稳性问题，使随机学习算法能够在该模型中保持性能，并在多个应用场景中获得了改进的遗憾界，同时揭示了随机顺序模型与对抗模型在可学习性特征上的重要差异。

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for

feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an
efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

Motivation: 条件扩散模型的训练通常依赖大规模数据集，但这些数据集中往往包含不精确的条件输入信息（如噪声、模糊或不完整的标签），导致条件不匹配和生成质量下降。

Method: 基于似然最大化推导出统一框架，包含生成组件（建模不精确标签分布）和分类组件（使用扩散分类器推断类别后验概率），并通过优化的时间步采样策略提高效率。

Conclusion: DMIS是扩散模型中首个系统研究不精确监督问题的框架，能够有效处理各种形式的不精确监督，提升生成质量。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Motivation: 状态空间模型在处理长序列任务时需要平衡表达能力和计算负担，核心挑战是如何在最大化表达能力的同时限制计算成本。

Method: 基于控制理论和Hankel奇异值分析，在训练过程中识别高能量状态维度并进行平衡截断，适用于线性时不变SSM和选择性模型。

Result: 实验表明，训练中降维显著加速优化过程，压缩模型保留了任务关键结构，而直接训练小维度模型会丢失这些结构。

Conclusion: 从大模型开始并在训练过程中缩小的SSM能够实现计算效率，同时保持更高的性能表现。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

Conclusion: 迭代精炼框架为理解VAR提供了新视角，揭示了其高效性的设计原理，同时提供了与扩散生态系统工具集成的实用接口，保持了少步、尺度并行生成的优势。

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

Conclusion: SASL框架在保持可解释性的同时实现了高性能预测，为临床实践提供了清晰可操作的见解。

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks,
with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to

outperformed other algorithms, achieving the fastest training times and highest
returns across benchmarks, completing 5,000 episodes in 41:24 for the Platform

Conclusion: UD3RL框架成功解决了接近旅行商问题，通过分离决策任务实现了高效求解，展现了良好的泛化性能和实用性。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

*Aleksei Arzhantsev,Otmane Sakhi,Flavian Vasile*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoiRL是一种轻量级的离线强化学习方法，用于改进大语言模型的推理能力，无需真实奖励标签，比在线方法TTRL训练快2.5倍且性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的强化学习需要真实奖励标签，而测试时强化学习(TTRL)虽然使用多数投票奖励但计算成本高昂，需要寻找更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出RoiRL方法，通过优化加权对数似然目标来逼近正则化最优策略，无需维护参考模型，显著降低内存和计算需求。

Result: 实验结果显示RoiRL训练速度比TTRL快2.5倍，在推理基准测试中表现一致优于TTRL。

Conclusion: RoiRL为无标签自改进大语言模型提供了一条可扩展的路径，实现了更高效的推理能力提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分数蒸馏的蛋白质骨架生成方法，显著减少了扩散模型的采样步骤，实现了20倍以上的速度提升，同时保持了与原始模型相当的设计性、多样性和新颖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流式生成模型在蛋白质骨架生成中表现出色，但需要数百次迭代步骤，计算成本高，限制了在大规模蛋白质发现中的应用。

Method: 采用分数身份蒸馏（SiD）技术，结合多步生成和推理时噪声调制，训练少步蛋白质骨架生成器。

Result: 蒸馏后的少步生成器实现了20倍以上的采样速度提升，同时保持了与Proteina教师模型相当的设计性、多样性和新颖性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了推理成本，使基于扩散的模型更接近实际蛋白质工程应用，支持大规模计算机蛋白质设计。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

Motivation: 解决深度学习预测器在稳健资产分配中因目标不匹配和误差放大而失效的问题。

Method: 使用路径签名提供资产动态的丰富几何表示，并采用签名增强注意力机制嵌入金融归纳偏差（如领先滞后效应）。

Result: 在每日S&P 100股票数据评估中，SIT明显优于传统和深度学习基线，特别是相比预测后优化模型。

Conclusion: 投资组合感知目标和几何感知归纳偏差对于机器学习系统中的风险感知资本分配至关重要。

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

Motivation: 现有模型依赖计算昂贵的预处理和多阶段训练，且无法发现明确的基因相互作用，需要更高效和可解释的细胞分化建模方法。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

Result: 在四个医疗中心收集的iEEG记录上评估，方法实现了有竞争力的iEEG分类性能，为从业者提供了更高的透明度和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在可靠和可解释的临床变长时间序列分类方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is
fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue
changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and
response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow
matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of
structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically,
ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

Method: 系统性地评估基于置信度、分散度和混合指标的性能，涵盖多种模型架构、数据集和分布偏移类型。

Result: 混合指标在数据集中心和模型中心评估设置中始终优于单一方面指标，特别是预测矩阵的核范数在各种任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该研究为部署场景中的无监督模型评估提供了实用且可推广的基础。

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IRL方法仅恢复确定性奖励估计或匹配期望回报，无法充分建模专家行为的分布特性，特别是在学习奖励分布方面存在局限。

Method: 通过最小化一阶随机优势违规，将失真风险度量整合到策略学习中，从而同时恢复奖励分布和分布感知策略。

Result: 在合成基准、真实世界神经行为数据和MuJoCo控制任务上的实验表明，该方法能够恢复表达性奖励表示并实现最先进的模仿性能。

Conclusion: 该分布框架适用于行为分析和风险感知模仿学习，能够有效捕获专家行为的丰富结构特征。

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability
measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications
spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these
input measures are empirical distributions built from sensitive datasets,
motivating a differentially private (DP) treatment. We present, to our

Conclusion: 提出的基于平衡符号图的轻量级变压器网络在EEG信号分类任务中表现良好，具有参数效率高和可解释性强的优势。

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

Method: 训练一系列GNN网络，每个网络学习迭代优化前一个网络生成的相似度矩阵。采用在节点对上操作而非单个节点上的强大架构，捕获标准消息传递网络无法表示的全局结构模式。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，链式GNN方法比现有方法准确率提升3倍以上，在常规图上唯一成功解决所有竞争方法失败的情况。与传统优化后处理结合后，在图对齐基准上显著优于最先进的求解器。

Conclusion: 链式GNN方法通过迭代优化和全局结构建模，成功提升了图神经网络在图对齐问题上的性能，超越了传统优化方法的表现。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出一种用于图神经网络的自适应节点特征选择方法，在训练过程中识别并移除不必要的特征，通过特征置换验证性能变化来确定特征相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据引入了复杂依赖关系，传统特征重要性度量方法可能不适用。需要能够衡量特征对模型输出贡献的方法，用于解释决策、降维甚至通过消除无用变量来提高性能。

Method: 基于干预的方法，在训练过程中通过置换特征值后验证性能的变化来确定相关特征。该方法与模型和任务无关，能够跟踪特征相关性随特征逐步丢弃的演化过程。

Result: 实证结果验证了该方法对不同图架构的灵活性，以及对更具挑战性的图学习设置的适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能返回训练结束后的特征重要性得分，还能监控特征是否被有效消除，并可用此技术评估其他指标。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

Motivation: 在边缘和移动设备上使用预训练神经网络时，需要高效适应用户特定的运行时数据分布，但受限于计算和内存资源。现有方法依赖标签数据、完整反向传播或服务器端元训练，不适合受限设备。

Method: 通过Betti数分析激活空间的拓扑特征，仅使用前向传播来对重要层进行排序，无需标签或梯度。

Result: 在16对基准模型和数据集上评估，AdaBet比基于梯度的方法平均分类准确率提高5%，平均峰值内存消耗减少40%。

Conclusion: AdaBet提供了一种无需梯度的层选择方法，能够在资源受限的设备上实现高效的重训练和适应。

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

Conclusion: VGB通过理论基础的随机游走和概率回溯，有效缓解验证器错误带来的问题，为过程引导的测试时采样提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

Conclusion: 理论和实证表明MoE学习中近似误差与估计误差的权衡取决于专家数量，为MoE模型设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

Result: 在500个客户端和90%滞后节点的测试中，FTTE比同步联邦学习收敛速度快81%，设备内存使用降低80%，通信负载减少69%，并且在挑战性场景下达到与半异步方法相当或更高的目标精度。

Conclusion: FTTE是首个适用于异构且主要资源受限边缘设备的实用且可扩展的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

Motivation: 传统QUCB算法在非平稳RL环境中面临分布漂移问题，导致策略在变化后可能利用次优奖励。需要开发能够检测分布变化并自适应调整探索-利用平衡的算法。

Method: 提出Density-QUCB算法，使用转移密度函数检测分布漂移，并利用其似然来增强Q-learning UCB的不确定性估计质量，实现探索与利用的平衡。

Result: 理论证明DQUCB比QUCB具有更好的遗憾保证；实验显示DQUCB在多个RL任务中具有更低的遗憾，并在COVID-19患者医院分配任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DQUCB算法有效解决了非平稳RL中的分布漂移问题，结合了模型无关RL的计算效率，在理论和实践中均表现出色。

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

Conclusion: 证明了基于可穿戴传感器的RPE估计的可行性，并确定了提高模型泛化能力的关键挑战。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出了Best-of-Majority (BoM)推理策略，结合多数投票和Best-of-N的优势，在Pass@k设置下实现最小化最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理中，对于困难任务，单次选择策略（如多数投票或Best-of-N）表现不佳，而Pass@k评估允许提交多个响应，需要更有效的推理策略。

Method: 结合多数投票和BoN的优点，提出BoM策略：首先限制候选集为高频响应，然后选择前k个奖励最高的响应。

Result: 理论证明当采样预算N=Ω(C*)时，BoM的遗憾为O(ε_opt + √(ε_RM²C*/k))，并建立了匹配下界，证明算法是最小化最优的。实验结果显示在数学问题上BoM优于多数投票和BoN。

Conclusion: BoM在Pass@k推理设置中实现了最优性能，且性能不会随N增加而下降，是多数投票和BoN的有效替代方案。

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

Conclusion: 选择性保护低概率推理火花比盲目保持高熵更有效，Lp-Reg通过正则化机制实现了持续探索和性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.
