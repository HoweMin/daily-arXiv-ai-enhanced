*Hung Le,Sherif Abbas,Minh Hoang Nguyen,Van Dai Do,Huu Hiep Nguyen,Dung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将分子动力学模拟重新定义为时间序列预测问题，使用基于DFT参数化的Morse势函数的物理约束来预测原子位移，实现高效且准确的长时间尺度模拟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度泛函理论方法计算成本高昂，限制了长期分子动力学模拟的可行性，需要开发更高效的替代方案

Method: 将MD模拟作为时间序列预测问题，使用预测模型通过位移而非绝对位置预测原子轨迹，并引入基于DFT参数化Morse势函数的物理约束损失函数来确保物理合理性

Result: 在多种材料上持续超越标准基线方法的模拟精度，能够在几分钟内稳定模拟数千个MD步骤，为昂贵的DFT模拟提供了可扩展的替代方案

Conclusion: 整合物理知识对于提高原子轨迹预测的可靠性和精度至关重要，该方法为大规模分子动力学模拟提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

*Sergey Troshin,Wafaa Mohammed,Yan Meng,Christof Monz,Antske Fokkens,Vlad Niculae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出选择性采样方法，在数学推理任务中动态切换贪婪采样和高温采样，以平衡输出多样性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高温采样虽然能增加语言模型输出的多样性，但在需要高精度的数学推理任务中会降低推理质量，因为会在敏感解码位置采样到错误续写。

Method: 提出选择性采样方法，基于采样风险度量动态切换贪婪采样和高温采样。通过在小规模可验证问题上训练轻量级分类器来预测采样风险，并将其与基础语言模型集成。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性采样即使在高温设置下也能改善质量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 选择性采样方法有效解决了高温采样在数学推理任务中的准确性下降问题，实现了更好的质量-多样性平衡。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

### [3] [Automated Extraction of Material Properties using LLM-based AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01235)
*Subham Ghosh,Abhishek Tewari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的自动化工作流，从约10,000篇科学文献中提取热电和结构特性数据，构建了目前最大的热电材料数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前材料发现受限于缺乏大型、机器可读的数据集，现有数据库要么规模小、人工整理，要么偏向第一性原理结果，实验文献未被充分利用。

Method: 开发了基于LLM的智能工作流，集成了动态令牌分配、零样本多智能体提取和条件表解析技术，在准确性和计算成本之间取得平衡。

Result: 从文献中提取了27,822条温度分辨特性记录，包含热电优值、塞贝克系数、电导率等参数，以及晶体结构属性。GPT-4.1达到最高准确率(F1=0.91)，GPT-4.1 Mini以更低成本提供相近性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了迄今最大的LLM整理热电数据集，建立了可扩展的数据驱动材料发现基础，并发布了交互式网络探索器供社区使用。

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

### [4] [RSAVQ: Riemannian Sensitivity-Aware Vector Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01240)
*Zukang Xu,Xing Hu,Qiang Wu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSAVQ是一个用于大语言模型极低比特量化的新型向量量化框架，通过几何驱动的创新方法解决方向误差和比特分配问题，在2-4比特量化中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型参数指数增长给资源受限设备部署带来挑战，现有向量量化方法存在无约束方向误差和次优比特分配两个关键问题。

Method: 提出RSAVQ框架，包含两个几何驱动创新：1) 误差方向敏感度指导(EDSG)，利用Fisher信息矩阵诱导的黎曼度量将量化误差投影到参数空间低敏感度方向；2) 权重通道敏感度指导(WCSG)，通过FIM曲率分析构建通道级敏感度度量来动态指导比特资源分配。

Result: 实验表明RSAVQ优于现有方法。在LLaMA-3 8B的2比特量化中，RSAVQ在困惑度上领先基线方法0.4，在零样本准确率上领先1.5。

Conclusion: 该工作为受限环境提供了实用解决方案，并在信息几何与神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，推动了高效深度学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

### [5] [Adaptive Federated Learning Defences via Trust-Aware Deep Q-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01261)
*Vedant Palit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信任感知深度Q网络的联邦学习防御方法，通过多信号证据集成和序列决策来对抗投毒和后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在部分可观测性下容易受到投毒和后门攻击，需要设计有效的防御机制。

Method: 将防御建模为部分可观测序列决策问题，使用信任感知深度Q网络集成多信号证据，优化长期鲁棒性-准确性目标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上验证：基线准确率稳步提升；客户端重叠增加可提高准确率并降低攻击成功率；信号预算减少时准确率稳定但攻击成功率上升；DQN实现了最佳鲁棒性-准确性权衡。

Conclusion: 序列信念更新可以缓解弱信号问题，深度Q网络在联邦学习防御中表现出最优的性能权衡。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

### [6] [RSTGCN: Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Train Delay Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01262)
*Koyena Chowdhury,Paramita Koley,Abhijnan Chakraborty,Saptarshi Ghosh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出RSTGCN模型预测铁路车站的平均到达延误，包含空间注意力机制创新，并发布了印度铁路网络的大规模数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的列车延误预测对铁路运营效率至关重要，现有方法主要关注单个列车的精确延误预测，需要支持更高级别交通管理的车站级延误预测

Method: 设计铁路中心化时空图卷积网络(RSTGCN)，整合列车频率感知的空间注意力机制等架构创新和特征集成

Result: 在包含4735个车站的印度铁路网络数据集上进行了广泛实验，相比现有基准方法在标准指标上实现了持续改进

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了大规模铁路网络平均延误预测建模，还提供了开放数据集以促进该关键领域的研究

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

### [7] [Budgeted Broadcast: An Activity-Dependent Pruning Rule for Neural Network Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01263)
*Yaron Meirovitch,Fuming Yang,Jeff Lichtman,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Budgeted Broadcast (BB)剪枝方法，通过给每个单元分配本地流量预算（活动率与扇出的乘积），在全局流量预算约束下最大化编码熵，实现选择性-受众平衡，从而提高网络效率和表示多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法基于对损失的影响（如权重大小或梯度）来移除参数，而本文旨在通过控制网络中的信息流量来学习更高效和多样化的表示。

Method: BB方法为每个单元分配本地流量预算，通过约束熵分析推导出选择性-受众平衡公式，并使用简单的本地执行器来剪枝扇入（降低活动率）或扇出（减少广播）。

Result: 在ASR的Transformer、人脸识别的ResNet和突触预测的3D U-Net上，BB在相同稀疏度下提高了编码熵和去相关性，有时甚至超过密集基线。在电子显微镜图像上，达到了最先进的F1和PR-AUC。

Conclusion: BB方法易于集成，为学习更高效和多样化的表示提供了一条路径，展示了在多种网络架构和任务上的有效性。

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然先前工作主要关注协作环境，但对抗性交互对于现实世界应用（如追逃、安全和竞争性操作）同样重要。

Method: 集成竞争性异构智能体强化学习与近端策略优化（HAPPO）的变体，在IsaacLab框架中实现对抗性策略的高效训练和评估。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功扩展了MARL在对抗性环境中的应用，为复杂多智能体竞争提供了可扩展的训练平台。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for
real-world applications such as pursuit-evasion, security, and competitive
manipulation. In this work, we extend the IsaacLab framework to support
scalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.
We introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous
agents with asymmetric goals and capabilities. Our platform integrates a
competitive variant of Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning with Proximal
Policy Optimization (HAPPO), enabling efficient training and evaluation under
adversarial dynamics. Experiments across several benchmark scenarios
demonstrate the framework's ability to model and train robust policies for
morphologically diverse multi-agent competition while maintaining high
throughput and simulation realism. Code and benchmarks are available at:

### [9] [RLP: Reinforcement as a Pretraining Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01265)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLP是一种信息驱动的强化预训练目标，将强化学习的探索精神引入预训练阶段，通过奖励思维链提供的信息增益来训练模型独立思考能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的大模型训练范式只在最后阶段使用强化学习，但这是否最优？本文旨在将强化学习的核心精神——探索——更早地引入预训练过程。

Method: 将思维链视为探索性动作，基于其对预测未来token的信息增益计算奖励信号，在预训练阶段使用密集奖励信号进行训练。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上预训练RLP，在8个数学科学基准上平均提升19%；在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上平均从42.81%提升到61.32%，科学推理任务提升23%。

Conclusion: RLP成功将强化学习重构为普通文本的预训练目标，弥合了下一个token预测与有用思维链推理之间的差距，证明了其在不同架构和模型规模上的可扩展性。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

### [10] [Safe Reinforcement Learning-Based Vibration Control: Overcoming Training Risks with LQR Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01269)
*Rohan Vitthal Thorat,Juhi Singh,Rajdip Nayek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LQR和强化学习的混合控制框架，用于结构振动控制，避免了对精确系统模型的依赖，同时解决了RL训练期间的安全风险问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的振动控制方法需要繁琐的系统辨识过程，而纯强化学习方法在训练阶段可能对结构造成损害。研究发现即使基于错误模型的LQR控制器也比无控制情况表现更好，这启发了混合控制框架的开发。

Method: 提出混合控制框架，将LQR控制器与RL控制器结合。LQR策略从随机选择的模型和参数中推导，不依赖真实或近似结构模型，整个框架保持无模型特性。

Result: 该混合方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最小化了朴素RL实现中固有的探索风险。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决基于RL的振动控制中关键训练安全挑战并提供验证解决方案的研究，为结构振动控制提供了安全有效的无模型方法。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息论的创新方法来识别和分析RNN中的信息中继节点，通过量化节点间输入输出向量的互信息来追踪信息流动路径，并在多种RNN架构上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解RNN的内部动态对于提高其可解释性和改进设计至关重要，但目前缺乏有效的方法来识别网络中信息传输的关键节点。

Method: 使用信息论方法量化节点间互信息，识别信息中继节点，并在合成和真实时间序列分类任务中应用，包括LSTM和GRU等架构，还进行了节点敲除实验。

Result: 揭示了不同架构中信息中继的独特模式，展示了信息如何随时间处理和维持，节点敲除实验证实了识别节点的重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增进了对RNN复杂机制的理解，还为设计更鲁棒和可解释的神经网络提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

*Hengwei Zhao,Zhengzhong Tu,Zhuo Zheng,Wei Wang,Junjue Wang,Rusty Feagin,Wenzhe Jiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出NcPU框架，通过非对比学习解决正样本-未标注样本学习中的表示学习瓶颈，无需辅助信息即可在复杂数据集上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前PU学习方法在复杂数据集上性能远低于监督学习方法的问题，主要瓶颈在于不可靠监督下难以学习判别性表示

Method: 结合噪声对鲁棒的非对比监督损失(NoiSNCL)和幻影标签消歧(PLD)方案，NoiSNCL在不可靠监督下对齐类内表示，PLD通过基于遗憾的标签更新提供保守负监督

Result: 在多种数据集上显著优于现有PU方法，包括灾害后建筑损伤测绘等实际应用场景，NoiSNCL使简单PU方法达到竞争性性能

Conclusion: NcPU框架通过非对比学习和标签消歧的协同作用，有效解决了PU学习中的表示学习瓶颈，在复杂数据集上实现了与监督学习接近的性能

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

*Rui Melo,Rui Abreu,Corina S. Pasareanu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 受微眼动启发，提出一种轻量级位置编码扰动方法，无需微调即可探测LLM的潜在错误行为，包括事实性、安全性、毒性和后门攻击等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类视觉感知中的微眼动现象获得灵感，微眼动能揭示隐藏的感知动态，类似地希望通过轻量级扰动来揭示LLM的潜在错误行为信号。

Method: 使用轻量级位置编码扰动作为探测手段，无需微调或任务特定监督，通过分析模型对这些扰动的响应来检测错误行为。

Result: 在多个先进LLM上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测各种错误行为，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 预训练的LLM已经编码了标记自身错误所需的内在证据，微眼动启发的干预为检测和缓解不良行为提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

Conclusion: ThinKV通过思想自适应压缩有效解决了大模型推理中的内存瓶颈问题，实现了内存效率和推理性能的显著提升。

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于领域自适应的车辆延误估计框架GBBW，通过重加权源域数据来提高模型在不同交叉口的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型假设训练和测试数据分布相同，但现实中交叉口在道路几何、信号配时和驾驶行为等方面存在差异，导致模型泛化能力差。

Method: 将数据分为源域和目标域，提取关键交通特征，使用少量目标域标注数据微调模型，并提出GBBW模型基于与目标域的相似性重加权源域数据。

Result: 在亚利桑那州皮马县57个异构交叉口数据上测试，相比8种先进ML回归模型和7种基于实例的DA方法，GBBW框架提供了更准确和鲁棒的延误估计。

Conclusion: 该框架提高了模型可迁移性，支持更可靠的交通信号优化、拥堵管理和基于性能的规划，促进机器学习技术在真实交通系统中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

Abstract: Deep learning-based 3-dimensional (3D) shape reconstruction from
2-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly
important in medical disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and computational
modeling. This review surveys the methodological landscape of 3D MRI
reconstruction, focusing on 4 primary approaches: point cloud, mesh-based,
shape-aware, and volumetric models. For each category, we analyze the current
state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and
applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview
ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the
clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of
their training and testing data. We examine publicly available datasets,
computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the
emerging research directions including multimodal integration and
cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a
structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify
opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable,
and clinically impactful solutions.

TL;DR: 本文研究了两层神经网络训练损失梯度的低秩结构，放宽了训练数据和参数的各向同性假设。在尖峰数据模型中，证明了输入权重梯度近似低秩，由两个秩一成分主导：一个与数据残差对齐，另一个与输入数据中的秩一尖峰对齐。

Motivation: 研究神经网络梯度结构的低秩特性，特别是在非各向同性数据和参数设置下，理解梯度组成成分及其与数据特征、激活函数的关系。

Method: 采用尖峰数据模型，分析各向异性和病态数据，考虑均值场和神经正切核两种缩放机制，理论推导梯度结构并实验验证。

Result: 发现梯度由两个秩一成分主导，分别对应数据残差和输入数据尖峰，这些成分的平衡受数据特性、缩放机制和激活函数影响。正则化方法能选择性地调节这些成分。

Conclusion: 神经网络训练梯度具有低秩结构，由特定数据特征主导，这一发现为理解训练动态和设计有效正则化方法提供了理论依据。

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个量子启发的内在维度估计基准QuIIEst，包含无限族拓扑非平凡流形，用于评估现有IDE方法在复杂流形上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IDE方法在真实数据集上估计结果差异很大，需要更复杂的基准来评估这些方法。流形假设认为数据集位于低维潜在流形上，但现有基准流形过于简单。

Method: 利用量子光学方法嵌入任意齐次空间，允许曲率修改和添加噪声，构建拓扑非平凡流形家族。

Result: 测试的IDE方法在QuIIEst流形上的准确性普遍低于现有基准，且性能随曲率不均匀性增加而下降很小，表明基准本身具有挑战性。

Conclusion: QuIIEst基准揭示了现有IDE方法在复杂流形上的局限性，为改进IDE方法提供了更真实的测试平台。

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a
framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video

analysis provides an explanation for why discrete action representations
perform well in practice.

TL;DR: 提出了两种改进二值神经网络验证的整数规划方法：新的多分类线性目标函数和利用BNN递归结构的有效不等式生成技术，提高了验证效率和扰动范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二值神经网络验证问题可以表述为整数规划问题，但传统IP方法由于大M约束导致的巨大完整性差距而难以求解，需要改进IP公式化方法。

Method: 1) 为多分类场景设计新的线性目标函数；2) 利用BNN的递归结构生成有效不等式，改进IP公式化。

Result: 与现有IP方法相比，在有限时间内能够验证BNN对抗更大范围的输入扰动。

Conclusion: 所提出的技术显著提升了二值神经网络验证的效率和能力，为BNN的鲁棒性评估提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文从变分互信息下界出发，推导出两种自监督表示学习训练范式：自蒸馏互信息(SDMI)和联合互信息(JMI)，为现有方法的架构组件提供了理论解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督表示学习虽然取得了显著经验成功，但其理论基础仍不充分。现有工作多从信息论目标或防止表征崩溃的启发式方法角度进行统一，而预测器网络、停止梯度操作等架构元素常被视为经验性补充。

Method: 从变分互信息下界出发，推导出两种训练范式：SDMI需要交替优化，使停止梯度操作理论必需；JMI允许通过对称架构进行联合优化。预测器网络和统计正则化器分别作为两种范式中互信息目标的可行替代。

Result: 证明了现有许多自监督表示学习方法都是这两种范式的具体实例或近似，为不同架构组件的选择提供了超越启发式便利的理论解释。

Conclusion: 该论文通过第一性原理方法表明，自监督表示学习算法的学习目标决定了其可能的优化策略和模型设计选择，为现有方法的架构组件提供了统一的理论框架。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估数据集对称性假设的度量方法，通过双样本神经网络分类器测试来量化数据集中的各向异性程度，并揭示了基准点云数据集中存在的高度对齐现象。


<details>

Motivation: 对称感知方法（如数据增强和等变架构）假设变换后的数据点在测试分布中具有高概率或"重要性"，但这一假设需要严格评估。

Method: 开发了一个度量各向异性（对称性破坏）的指标，使用双样本神经网络分类器来区分原始数据集和其随机增强的等价版本。

Result: 在合成数据集上验证了该指标的有效性，并在多个基准点云数据集中发现了出乎意料的高度对齐现象。理论分析表明分布对称性破坏会阻碍不变方法达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 等变方法在数据集上的效果具有依赖性，理解等变性需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏置。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under
arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the
corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide
explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,
loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way
available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient
computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the
design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers
interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing
problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures
where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our
theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments
where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the
cross-entropy loss function.

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

Motivation: 解决现实应用中状态观测被动作随机触发的强化学习问题，这类观测约束在许多实际场景中很常见。

Method: 提出了ATST-MDP框架和动作序列学习范式，推导了贝尔曼最优方程，在线性MDP假设下构建了动作序列特征映射，并开发了ST-LSVI-UCB算法。

Result: ST-LSVI-UCB算法实现了$\widetilde O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$的遗憾界，其中K是回合数，d是特征维度，γ是折扣因子。

Conclusion: 为动作触发稀疏观测的强化学习建立了理论基础，证明了在此类观测约束下高效学习仍然是可行的。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are
stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world
applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically
Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a
specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored
Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the
action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a
sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP
assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an
induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose
off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps
and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered
settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde
O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the
feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode
non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical
foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while
demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation
constraints.

Motivation: 扩散模型在训练时学习分数函数用于生成样本，但存在一个基本问题：它们实际学习的是哪个分数？理论上，完全匹配经验分数的模型只会复制训练数据而无法生成新样本。

Result: 研究结果表明选择性欠拟合对于理解扩散模型至关重要，为模型的泛化和生成性能提供了新的可测试见解。

Conclusion: 选择性欠拟合是理解扩散模型泛化能力的关键机制，优秀模型在特定区域更精确地逼近分数函数，而在其他区域保持欠拟合状态以实现有效生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

Conclusion: fSGLD能够高效寻找平坦最小值，计算成本仅为SGD级别，约为SAM的一半，同时保持优越的泛化性能。

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima
in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature
solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses
the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian
noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby
optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature
information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure
of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global
minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the
inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly
coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the
benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best
known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized
objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,
in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD
achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline
algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of
SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM是一种轻量级、模型无关的方法，用于掩码扩散模型在推理时的自校正，通过定义自校正损失来学习每个token的质量分数，无需强化学习或验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型需要自校正能力——在推理时检测和修正低质量token。虽然掩码扩散模型在离散空间的生成建模中表现出潜力，但其自校正能力仍未被充分理解。

Method: PRISM通过定义自校正损失来学习每个token的质量分数，这些质量分数与MDM在同一前向传播中计算，用于检测低质量token。

Result: PRISM在多个领域和规模上提升了MDM推理性能：数独、无条件文本（170M）和代码生成（LLaDA 8B）。

Conclusion: PRISM为掩码扩散模型提供了一种有效的推理时自校正方法，无需改变模型架构或训练过程。

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

TL;DR: 提出Drop-Muon方法，挑战传统深度学习优化中每步更新所有层的做法，通过随机选择部分层进行更新，结合渐进式训练和非欧几里得更新，实现更高效的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习优化器（如Muon）每步更新所有层，但作者认为这种做法在理论和实践中都存在根本性次优问题，需要探索更高效的训练策略。

Method: 提出非欧几里得随机渐进训练方法Drop-Muon，每步只按随机调度更新部分层，结合渐进式训练效率和层特异性非欧几里得更新。

Result: 在CNN实验中，Drop-Muon始终优于全网络更新的Muon，达到相同精度时wall-clock时间快1.4倍，成本分析显示全网络更新仅在特定层平滑度关系下最优。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明大规模模型训练可以更高效，挑战了全网络更新的现状，提供了理论上有依据的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all
layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art
optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing
that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and
in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training
method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of
layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of
progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise
smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and
stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive
training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further
reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific
relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms
full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in
wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale
models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a
highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

TL;DR: 提出基于潘多拉盒问题的新框架，在LLM推理时优化生成成本与质量平衡，通过UCB算法实现接近最优的停止策略，实验显示可减少15-35%的生成次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成需要在输出质量与推理成本之间取得平衡，特别是使用多次生成时。现有方法缺乏理论基础的推理时优化策略。

Method: 将每次生成视为打开成本随机的"盒子"，开发UCB风格的潘多拉盒算法，结合Bradley-Terry变换处理不同提示的奖励缩放问题，实现自适应停止阈值学习。

Result: 在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上，使用多种LLM-奖励模型对进行实验，自适应策略能在保持相同性能的同时，平均减少15-35%的生成次数。

Conclusion: 建立了最优停止理论与推理时扩展之间的原则性桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能保证和实际效率提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Method: 引入神经网络替代框架，直接从笛卡尔坐标学习集体变量，利用自动微分提供雅可比矩阵，绕过了解析形式的限制。

Result: 在MgCl2离子配对系统上，该方法对简单距离集体变量和复杂配位数集体变量都实现了高精度，雅可比矩阵误差呈近高斯分布，适用于高斯过程回归流程。

Conclusion: 该框架使基于梯度的自由能方法能够整合复杂和机器学习集体变量，拓宽了生物化学和材料模拟的应用范围。

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

Motivation: 当前神经压缩方法虽然压缩率高，但基于卷积的解码器复杂度和计算成本高，阻碍了技术应用，需要解决解码器瓶颈问题。

Method: 在带有向量量化的自动编码器中引入低秩表示，通过对学习到的图像潜在表示执行一系列计算高效的低秩操作来重建数据。

Conclusion: 基于低秩表示的压缩重建框架能有效解决神经压缩中的解码器瓶颈问题，在保持重建质量的同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

TL;DR: SoftAdaClip是一种差分隐私训练方法，用平滑的tanh变换替代硬裁剪，在保护敏感数据的同时显著减少子群体间的不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DP-SGD中的梯度裁剪会不成比例地抑制少数子群体的学习信号，导致模型性能和公平性下降，特别是对代表性不足的群体。

Method: 提出SoftAdaClip方法，用基于tanh的平滑变换替代硬裁剪，在限制敏感度的同时保留相对梯度大小，并与自适应机制结合。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SoftAdaClip相比DP-SGD将子群体差异减少高达87%，相比Adaptive-DPSGD减少高达48%，且这些减少具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将平滑变换与自适应机制结合对于实现公平且私有的模型训练至关重要。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Local Linear Attention (LLA)，一种基于非参数统计理论的新型注意力机制，通过测试时回归视角推导，在理论分析和实际性能上优于线性注意力和Softmax注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Softmax注意力的高效替代方案已被广泛研究，但基于理论洞察的更具表达能力的机制（即使计算成本更高）相对未被充分探索。

Method: 从测试时回归视角推导LLA，提出两种内存高效原语解决计算复杂度问题，开发FlashLLA硬件高效块状算法，并实现定制推理内核减少内存开销。

Result: LLA在测试时回归、上下文回归、关联记忆和状态跟踪任务中有效适应非平稳性，在测试时训练和上下文学习中优于强基线，并展现出在大规模模型中可扩展性和适用性的有希望证据。

Conclusion: LLA通过理论优势和实践验证，为注意力机制提供了新的研究方向，特别是在处理非平稳数据和提升模型表达能力方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在OOD检测中计算成本高的问题，提供快速可靠的分布外检测方法，适用于视觉、机器人控制等多个实际应用领域。

Method: 结合雅可比迹和评分函数平方范数作为测试统计量，使用核密度估计估计分布内密度，仅需单次前向传播和一次雅可比向量积，利用Hutchinson迹估计器提高效率。

Conclusion: SCOPED为实际应用领域提供了实用、快速且可靠的OOD检测基础，适用于视觉感知伪影检测、自回归模型异常检测、强化学习探索和无监督训练数据集筛选等场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable
OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision,
outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement
learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了基于模型的强化学习算法MBPO在DeepMind Control Suite中表现不佳的原因，识别了动态模型与奖励模型尺度不匹配、目标表示选择不当两个关键问题，并提出了解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MBPO在OpenAI Gym中表现出色，但在DeepMind Control Suite中却表现不佳，这揭示了算法设计中对环境特定假设的隐式编码问题，需要深入理解合成数据何时有效、何时失效及其原因。

Method: 通过分析MBPO在七个挑战性DMC任务中的失败案例，识别出两个耦合问题：动态模型与奖励模型的尺度不匹配导致评论家低估，以及目标表示选择不当增加模型方差。

Result: 解决这些失效模式后，MBPO在七个任务中的五个任务上超越了模型自由算法SAC，同时在OpenAI Gym中保持了原有的强性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果呼吁社区开发将MDP任务和环境结构与算法失效模式联系起来的分类法，追求统一解决方案，并澄清基准选择如何影响算法的泛化条件。

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

Conclusion: 研究为开发符合人类偏好的AI系统提供了有价值的见解，强调了在噪声反馈条件下进行偏好优化的重要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

Conclusion: 通过消融研究提供了将长度信号融入动态采样的替代方法见解，指出了未来研究方向

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习的经验行为高度不一致，在一个设置中有效的在线微调设计选择在另一个设置中可能完全失败，需要理论框架来解释和指导设计选择。

Result: 在63个案例中有45个案例的结果与该框架的预测高度一致，验证了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于离线数据集和预训练策略相对性能的离线到在线强化学习设计选择提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

Conclusion: 提出的(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL方法在高维黑盒优化问题上具有显著优势，为药物发现、材料设计等应用提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超网方法需要多GPU天，而现有LLM驱动方法存在探索偏差，无法发现整个搜索空间中不同延迟范围的架构。

Method: 1) 复杂度驱动的分区引擎；2) LLM驱动的架构提示协同进化算子；3) 零成本预测器避免从头训练大量候选架构。

Result: 在HW-NAS-Bench上，PEL-NAS实现了更高的HV、更低的IGD，在相似精度下延迟降低高达54%，搜索成本从几天降至几分钟。

Conclusion: PEL-NAS通过创新的搜索空间分区和协同进化机制，有效解决了LLM驱动的NAS中的探索偏差问题，实现了高效且多样化的神经架构搜索。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

*Shriram Karpoora Sundara Pandian,Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于密度比加权的行为克隆方法，通过小规模干净参考集估计轨迹级密度比，在离线强化学习中有效应对数据污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习数据集常受到对抗性投毒、系统错误或低质量样本的污染，导致标准行为克隆和离线RL方法性能下降。需要一种不依赖污染机制知识的鲁棒方法。

Method: 使用小规模已验证的干净参考集，通过二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，将这些比率裁剪后作为BC目标中的权重，优先处理干净专家行为，同时降低或丢弃污染数据。

Result: 建立了理论保证，证明在有限样本边界下收敛到干净专家策略，且边界与污染率无关。在连续控制基准测试中，即使在高污染率下仍保持接近最优性能，优于传统BC、BCQ和BRAC等基线方法。

Conclusion: Weighted BC是一种有效的鲁棒模仿学习方法，能够在不了解污染机制的情况下处理数据污染问题，在多种投毒协议下均表现出色。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

*Isha Gupta,Rylan Schaeffer,Joshua Kazdan,Ken Liu,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了对抗性攻击可转移性的关键区分：输入数据空间的攻击可以转移，而模型表示空间的攻击无法转移，除非表示空间有几何对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么图像对抗样本和文本越狱能在模型间转移，但视觉语言模型的图像越狱攻击却无法转移的现象。

Method: 通过理论证明和四个实验验证：1) 数学证明相同输入输出映射但不同表示的网络；2) 对图像分类器构建表示空间攻击；3) 对语言模型构建表示空间攻击；4) 对视觉语言模型构建数据空间攻击。

Result: 表示空间攻击对目标模型有效但无法转移，数据空间攻击可以成功转移，当表示空间几何对齐时表示空间攻击也能转移。

Conclusion: 对抗性转移不是所有攻击的固有属性，而是取决于其操作域——共享数据空间与模型独特表示空间，这对构建更鲁棒模型至关重要。

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的多智能体LLM答案聚合算法：最优权重(OW)和逆意外流行度(ISP)，利用一阶和二阶信息改进多数投票方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准多数投票方法平等对待所有答案，无法考虑模型间的潜在异质性和相关性，需要更有效的聚合方法。

Method: 设计了OW和ISP两种算法，利用一阶和二阶信息来改进多数投票，理论上证明在温和假设下能缓解多数投票的固有局限。

Result: 在合成数据集、UltraFeedback和MMLU等LLM微调基准以及ARMMAN真实医疗场景中，新方法始终优于多数投票。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅提供实际性能提升，还为设计鲁棒的多智能体LLM流水线提供了概念性见解。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

Conclusion: 设计的动作空间在保持疗效的同时提高了可解释性并促进了临床采用，证明了动作空间设计对强化学习在临床应用中行为策略的重要影响。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

Result: Flock完美解决了新的诊断数据集Petals，在54个不同领域的KG上实现了实体和关系预测任务的最先进性能

Conclusion: 概率节点关系等变性是提升知识图谱基础模型表达能力的关键，Flock模型证明了该方法的有效性

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保食品生产动物中药物的安全使用对保护动物福利和人类食品安全至关重要，不良事件可能预示着意外的药代动力学或毒代动力学效应，增加食品链中违规残留的风险。

Method: 使用FDA OpenFDA的128万份兽医药物不良事件报告，通过数据预处理、特征工程、集成多种监督学习模型（随机森林、CatBoost、XGBoost等），并采用欠采样和过采样处理类别不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 该框架表明结合严格的数据工程、先进机器学习和可解释AI能够实现准确、可解释的兽医安全结果预测，支持FARAD使命，加强残留风险评估和监管决策。

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CarbonX是一个基于时间序列基础模型的开源工具，用于碳强度预测和插补等脱碳任务，仅需历史碳强度数据即可在全球214个电网实现零样本预测，MAPE为15.82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碳强度预测工具存在三个主要限制：需要特定电网的电力结构数据、依赖单独的电网特定模型难以实现全球覆盖、缺乏不确定性估计，限制了碳感知应用的可靠性。

Method: 利用时间序列基础模型的通用性，仅使用历史碳强度数据和单一通用模型，支持零样本预测和插补任务，并提供95%覆盖率的预测区间。

Result: 在214个全球电网中实现15.82%的零样本预测MAPE；在13个基准电网中平均MAPE为9.59%，尾部预测MAPE为16.54%；可提供长达21天的预测且精度下降最小；在插补任务上比统计基线提升1.2-3.9倍。

Conclusion: CarbonX可以在数据有限的情况下轻松应用于任何电网并保持强大性能，是面向全球规模脱碳的实用工具。

Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing
and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built
environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts,
yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific
electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable;
(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

TL;DR: 提出Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL)框架，通过往返一致性作为奖励信号来训练模型，提高化学LLM在反应预测和逆合成等任务中的性能和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化学大语言模型在双向任务中缺乏往返一致性，表明模型学习的是单向记忆而非灵活掌握，往返一致性与主要任务性能高度相关。

Method: RTRL框架使用往返转换成功作为奖励信号训练模型，并提出迭代变体，让前向和反向映射交替训练，形成自改进循环。

Result: 实验表明RTRL在监督、自监督和合成数据机制下显著提升了性能和一致性，优于强基线。

Conclusion: 往返一致性不仅是理想特性，更是可训练目标，为构建更稳健可靠的基座模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，AI安全和对齐变得至关重要。提示防护作为一种轻量级防护机制被广泛使用，但本研究旨在揭示其局限性。

Method: 利用提示防护与主LLM之间的资源不对称性，编码一个轻量级防护无法解码但主模型能够解码的越狱提示。

Result: 该方法在Google Gemini、DeepSeek Chat、Grok和Mistral Le Chat等高度保护的聊天接口中持续实现越狱，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 揭示了轻量级提示防护在现代LLM架构中的固有攻击面，强调需要将防御重点从阻止恶意输入转向防止恶意输出。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is
paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms
designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.
In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,
highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production
models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat
interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok
(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry
between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that
lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack
surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and
underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to
preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment
issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and
malicious response leakage during thinking.

Abstract: 6G brings a paradigm shift towards AI-native wireless systems, necessitating

we demonstrate the efficacy of performing the channel estimation function in
the PUSCH receiver through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in
Python. This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time

Conclusion: TSci将预测工作流转变为白盒系统，既具有可解释性又可在不同任务间扩展，通过LLM驱动的代理框架实现了自动化、可靠的时间序列预测。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse
as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face
thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,
where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive
preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this
paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic
framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four
specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by
external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final
predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,
transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and
comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a
white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.
Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci
consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing
forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci
produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more
transparent and interpretable.

TL;DR: 提出了可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题评估LLM的反事实推理能力，发现现有模型在完整反事实推理（包含溯因步骤）中表现显著下降，并通过强化学习提升了模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM反事实推理能力的方法往往跳过溯因步骤，导致高估模型性能。需要开发能完整评估三个推理步骤（溯因、干预、预测）的框架。

Method: 引入可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题操作化因果推理，要求完整的三个推理步骤，并创建可扩展的合成数据。使用监督微调和强化学习进行模型训练。

Result: SOTA模型在完整反事实推理中准确率下降25-40%。强化学习在代码和数学问题上均取得1.5-2倍提升，而监督微调在OOD任务上表现下降。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效诱导核心认知行为并泛化到新领域，为提升LLM反事实推理能力提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three
steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing
alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This
skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their
applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However,
existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend
to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning
and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce
executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal
reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all
three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data
creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and
improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy
(25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like
o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set
comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on
out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a
model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems.
While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves
in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD
tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning
induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding
gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math
problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and
highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL)方法，通过人类干预的隐式偏好信号来预测未来状态，将单次干预扩展到未来L个时间步，从而在安全关键区域传播专家修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式模仿学习方法只修正当前状态的动作，而不调整未来状态的动作，但未来状态可能更具危险性。需要将人类干预的影响传播到未来状态，提高学习效率和安全性。

Method: PPL方法将每次人类干预引导到未来L个时间步（偏好范围），假设智能体执行相同动作且人类进行相同干预。通过在这些未来状态上应用偏好优化，将专家修正传播到智能体预期探索的安全关键区域。

Result: 在自动驾驶和机器人操作基准测试中验证了方法的效率和通用性。理论分析表明选择合适的偏好范围L可以平衡风险状态覆盖和标签正确性，从而限制算法最优性差距。

Conclusion: PPL方法通过将人类干预扩展到未来状态，显著提高了学习效率，减少了所需的人类演示数量，并在安全关键区域有效传播了专家修正。

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo
and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/ppl

TL;DR: MIRA是一种无需训练、在推理时对齐扩散模型的方法，通过图像空间的KL代理正则化来防止奖励黑客攻击，在保持提示遵从性的同时提高奖励分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的图像往往无法满足用户特定的标量奖励标准（如美学评分），传统的微调方法计算成本高，而现有的推理时对齐方法存在奖励黑客问题，即图像获得高分但偏离原始提示。

Method: 提出MIRA方法，引入图像空间的基于分数的KL代理，使用冻结的主干网络正则化采样轨迹，约束输出分布，使奖励增加而不发生分布外漂移。还推导了使用扩散分数的KL可处理近似。

Result: 在SDv1.5和SDXL模型、多种奖励（美学、HPSv2、PickScore）和公共数据集上，MIRA相比强基线实现了超过60%的胜率，同时保持提示遵从性。机制图显示奖励增益接近零漂移，而DNO方法随计算增加而漂移。

Conclusion: MIRA有效解决了扩散模型推理时对齐中的奖励黑客问题，通过图像空间约束实现了奖励提升而不损失提示遵从性。还扩展了MIRA-DPO，将偏好优化映射到推理时，无需微调即可处理不可微分奖励。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but
the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by
scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires
fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time
alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,
modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards
generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward
hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate
significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization
is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit
image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward
hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an
image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory
with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can
increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable
approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple
rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,
Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while
preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero
drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO,
mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone,
extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF中KL散度正则化的不同实现方式，证明了'k1 in reward'和'k2 as loss'在策略条件下梯度等价，都是RKL正则化的理论正确实现，而'k3 as loss'只是一阶有偏近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法中KL正则化的实现存在混淆，有些方法将其作为数值估计系数而非优化损失，需要建立统一框架来分析不同实现方式的理论基础。

Method: 建立统一框架连接两种实现风格：将数学项kn作为策略评分函数的分离系数或作为直接损失函数。通过梯度分析证明不同实现方式的等价性。

Result: 证明在策略条件下'k2 as loss'与'k1 in reward'梯度等价，都是RKL目标的正确实现；'k3 as loss'只是一阶有偏近似；离策略实现存在偏差并提出修正方法。

Conclusion: 为KL正则化的选择和正确实现提供了基于梯度的理论依据，有助于构建更稳健有效的RLHF系统。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent
overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided
by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the
term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we
establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct
implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached
coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct
loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show
that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient
in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove
that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss
for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under
on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact,
gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our
work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL
objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like
in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss.
Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss'
methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a
principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based
rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the
way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了IBCD（干预贝叶斯因果发现）框架，利用干预数据进行因果发现，通过建模总因果效应矩阵的似然，结合稀疏先验和数据驱动的网络结构权重，实现不确定性感知的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法在大规模任务上性能较差且无法量化不确定性，而高通量基因组扰动数据为改进模型识别提供了机会。

Method: 采用经验贝叶斯框架，对总因果效应矩阵建模（近似矩阵正态分布），使用spike-and-slab horseshoe先验，从观测数据中学习scale-free和Erdős-Rényi结构的权重，将每条边作为潜变量进行不确定性推理。

Result: 在广泛模拟中，IBCD在结构恢复方面优于现有基线方法；应用于521个基因的CRISPR扰动数据，边后验包含概率能够识别稳健的图结构。

Conclusion: IBCD框架在因果发现中实现了优越的性能和不确定性量化能力，为大规模干预数据分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging
problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens
have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to
improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor
performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we
propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian
framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models
the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated
by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a
spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven
weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational
data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware
inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior
structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR
perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior
inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

TL;DR: TetriServe是一个DiT服务系统，通过步级序列并行和基于轮次的调度机制，动态调整请求的并行度以提高GPU利用率和SLO达成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DiT服务系统使用固定程度的序列并行，在处理混合分辨率和截止时间的异构工作负载时效率低下，导致GPU利用率差和SLO达成率低。

Method: 提出步级序列并行策略，动态调整单个请求的并行度；引入基于轮次的调度机制，包括时间离散化、步级并行度自适应和请求联合打包。

Result: 在先进的DiT模型上评估显示，TetriServe相比现有解决方案实现了高达32%的SLO达成率提升，且不降低图像质量。

Conclusion: TetriServe通过动态并行度调整和智能调度策略，有效解决了DiT模型在严格SLO约束下的服务效率问题。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images
through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level
Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost,
particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree
sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with
mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO
attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically
adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines.
We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for
highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel
round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation
on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher
SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

Motivation: 探索强化学习能否推动蛋白质语言模型超越其预训练先验，发现潜在的序列-结构-功能规则。

Method: 将RL与PLMs配对应用于四个领域：抗菌肽设计、激酶变体优化、抗体工程和逆折叠，使用多种RL算法和模型类别。

Result: RL在所有基准测试中一致提高了成功率和采样效率，当奖励准确、策略容量充足且任务有改进空间时，改进效果显著。

Conclusion: 为蛋白质设计中的RL应用提供实用指导：优先奖励建模和校准，匹配算法与任务难度，在边际收益最大的地方分配容量。

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science
through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel,
reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise
multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs
beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function
rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four
domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody
engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model
classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it
reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL
consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a
three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity
jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies
have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,
improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains
saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in
protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling
policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,
and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is
available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的梯度裁剪使用固定的硬阈值，缺乏灵活性且忽略了梯度分布动态。需要一种更灵活、自适应的梯度整形方法。

Method: SPAMP跟踪局部梯度统计，动态估计阈值，并应用基于幂的变换以可微分方式调制更新幅度。将裁剪和预热重新表述为控制有效更新尺度的双重机制。

Result: 在图像和语言任务上的广泛实验表明，SPAMP在稳定性、收敛性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPAMP提供了一个原则性的替代方案，取代了传统的刚性启发式方法，通过统一框架实现了更好的训练性能。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its
formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient
distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive
Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into
smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics,
dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to
modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts
clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update
scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics.
Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP
improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病远程监测中存在的三种噪声（患者测量误差、环境噪声、数据传输丢失）导致UPDRS评分预测误差增加，需要提高预测模型的噪声鲁棒性。

Method: 首先将原始语音特征按选定特征的连续值分组为有序箱，构建对比对；然后使用对比对训练多层感知机编码器生成抗噪特征；最后将抗噪特征与原始特征拼接作为增强特征输入UPDRS预测模型。

Result: 通过可定制噪声注入模块的评估方法，实验表明NoRo能在不同噪声环境下成功增强各种下游预测模型的UPDRS预测噪声鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NoRo框架有效解决了帕金森病远程监测中的噪声问题，显著提升了UPDRS评分预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling
self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types
of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement
inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during
transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these
challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,
the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the
continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.
Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron
encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are
concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are
then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a
novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and
extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise
robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models
under different noisy environments.

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to
exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities
often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed
hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel
junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel,
FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true
random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with
minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to
18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.
With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established
scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106
parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large

Motivation: 研究变分自编码器(VAE)中后验坍塌现象的本质，揭示其不仅是优化失败，而是数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的相变。

Method: 通过分析后验坍塌相关平凡解的稳定性，识别临界超参数阈值，并在合成和真实数据集上验证这种临界行为。

Conclusion: 后验坍塌是一种涌现的相变现象，为深度生成模型的可训练性和表示能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational
autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal
that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and
model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution
associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter
threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from
collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the
approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical
behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of
a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not
merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising
from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This
perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational
capacity of deep generative models.

TL;DR: 研究发现SFT分数不能可靠预测RL训练后的性能提升，有时甚至会导致更差结果。提出了泛化损失和Pass@large k作为更好的预测指标。


<details>

Motivation: 挑战当前LLM训练中SFT分数与RL性能之间的假设关系，发现高SFT分数并不总是转化为更好的RL结果。

Method: 训练了数百个12B参数模型，使用SFT和GRPO RLVR，在7个数学基准上进行多达256次重复评估，消耗超过100万GPU小时。

Result: 基于泛化损失和Pass@large k的预测比直接使用SFT分数更准确，R²和Spearman相关系数提高最多0.5（2倍）。

Conclusion: SFT分数不是RL性能的可靠预测指标，泛化损失和Pass@large k提供了更有效的评估方法，对实际应用有重要价值。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic

\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

### [69] [CAT: Curvature-Adaptive Transformers for Geometry-Aware Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01634)
*Ryan Y. Lin,Siddhartha Ojha,Nicholas Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT)，通过可学习的门控机制动态路由token到三种几何注意力分支，实现自适应几何专业化，在知识图谱补全任务上显著优于固定几何方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer假设欧几里得几何，限制了在非欧几里得结构数据上的有效性。现有方法需要预先选择单一几何，缺乏对混合几何特性的灵活性。

Method: CAT架构包含三个几何注意力分支（欧几里得、双曲、球面），通过轻量级可微分门控机制动态学习每个token的路由，每个分支使用针对各自流形优化的几何特定操作。

Result: 在FB15k-237和WN18RR知识图谱补全基准测试中，CAT相比固定几何基线在MRR和Hits@10指标上提升约10%，仅增加5%参数且推理时间相当。

Conclusion: 学习几何自适应优于任何单一固定几何，CAT为跨语言、视觉和多模态领域的混合几何架构提供了可扩展和可解释的基础。

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly
assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their
effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to
hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical
patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori,
reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We
introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that
dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches
through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry
approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to
the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The
routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch
employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On
knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves
approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines
with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These
results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single
fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable
and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across
language, vision, and multimodal domains.

*Liyan Xie,Muhammad Siddeek,Mohamed Seif,Andrea J. Goldsmith,Mengdi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种组合模式水印框架，用于检测和定位水印LLM输出中的后生成编辑，通过词汇表分区和组合模式嵌入水印，并设计轻量级统计方法进行编辑检测和定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，LLM生成的内容可能经过人为修订或欺骗性攻击，因此需要检测和定位这些后生成编辑，以保护水印的有效性。

Method: 采用组合模式水印框架，将词汇表划分为不相交子集，在生成过程中通过强制确定性组合模式嵌入水印，并设计全局和局部统计量进行水印检测和编辑定位。

Result: 在开源LLM上评估了多种编辑场景，显示出在编辑定位方面的强大实证性能。

Conclusion: 提出的组合模式水印方法能够有效检测和定位水印LLM输出中的后生成编辑，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models,
enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However,
in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation
edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to
detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:
detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To
this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework,
which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark
by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during
generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic
that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight
local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two
task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and
evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios,
demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于支持基分解的新框架，用于高效近似注意力计算，突破了之前方法需要受限有界输入假设的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有子二次注意力近似算法需要受限的有界输入假设，这在现代大语言模型中很少成立，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 利用查询和键矩阵的亚高斯特性，将大值和小值分开处理：稀疏部分精确计算，稠密部分使用多项式近似。

Result: 建立了严格的理论保证，证明了子二次运行时间，并扩展到多阈值设置以消除所有分布假设。

Conclusion: 该方法为多项式注意力的经验成功提供了首个理论依据，表明softmax注意力可以通过带草图的多项式注意力组合来紧密近似。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in
scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a
sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the
restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in
practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for
efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically
demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian
behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries,
enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on
dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a
sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that
eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first
theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention
[Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be
closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with
sketching.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无源域样本的跨域持续学习方法REFEREE，通过频率感知提示技术和不确定性加权策略解决域偏移和噪声伪标签问题，使用核线性判别分析缓解灾难性遗忘，在多个数据集上超越了需要源域样本的现有方法。

Motivation: 现有跨域持续学习方法需要完全标记的源域样本，这在隐私受限环境中不可行。本文旨在解决无源域样本的跨域持续学习问题，完全禁止使用源域样本。

Method: REFEREE方法结合源预训练模型和大规模视觉语言模型，采用频率感知提示技术处理域偏移，使用不确定性加权策略缓解噪声伪标签影响，并通过核线性判别分析解决灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: 严格的数值研究表明，该方法显著超越了需要访问源域样本的现有方法，在多个数据集上取得了更好的性能。

Conclusion: REFEREE方法成功解决了无源域样本的跨域持续学习问题，通过频率感知动态提示协作和不确定性加权策略，在域偏移、噪声伪标签和灾难性遗忘等方面都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification
is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the
random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of
our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples
with significant margins.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Elsa的神经网络剪枝方法，通过约束优化技术实现高达90%的极端稀疏度，同时保持模型准确性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络剪枝方法在超过50-60%稀疏度时会严重降低模型准确性，无法满足大语言模型的计算和内存需求。

Method: 使用基于ADMM的标准约束优化技术，直接解决现有方法依赖替代目标公式的局限性问题。

Result: 在LLaMA-2-7B模型上达到90%稀疏度时，困惑度比现有最佳方法低7.8倍；还开发了量化变体Elsa-L，可扩展到27B超大型模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在推进LLM稀疏化前沿方面取得了有意义的进展，表明在有限探索方向上仍有显著的进一步改进机会。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive
computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite
its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional
methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%)
without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current
impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$,
which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model
fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice,
all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective
formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via
standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on
ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show
that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods;
e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on
LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present
$\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large
models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These
results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM
sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further
advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited
exploration.

TL;DR: AsyPPO是一种针对大语言模型RL训练的高效框架，通过轻量级mini-critics架构恢复critic角色，解决了传统价值函数在LLM规模下的计算瓶颈和稀疏奖励问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL4LLM方法为避免计算成本而放弃显式critic，但传统价值函数在LLM规模下训练昂贵且在稀疏奖励和长推理视野下效果不佳，需要从架构角度重新审视这一瓶颈。

Method: 采用轻量级mini-critics集合，每个critic在不相交的prompt分片上训练，鼓励多样性同时保持校准；利用critic间不确定性来优化策略更新：屏蔽critic一致状态的优势值，过滤高分歧状态以避免虚假探索。

Result: 仅使用5000个样本训练后，AsyPPO在多个基准测试中持续提升学习稳定性和性能，相比GRPO等强基线，在Qwen3-4b-Base上性能提升超过6%，在Qwen3-8b-Base和Qwen3-14b-Base上提升约3%。

Conclusion: 架构创新对于可扩展、高效算法的重要性，AsyPPO展示了通过精心设计的critic架构可以在保持效率的同时显著提升RL4LLM性能。

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing
them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:
conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM
scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We
revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce
Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable
framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in
large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each
trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while
preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust
estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy
update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add
little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy
regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source
data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability
and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,
achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about
three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without
additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural
innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过平衡嵌入空间中的均匀性和容忍度特性来学习强健的时间序列表示，改进对时间依赖关系的捕获。

Method: 使用层次化设置学习实例级和时间信息，集成温度调度器平衡均匀性和容忍度，采用层次化角度边界损失增强正负样本对的分离。

Result: 在128个UCR和30个UAE数据集上评估，分类任务显著优于现有方法，在Yahoo和KPI数据集上的异常检测任务获得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: TimeHUT通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡有效提升了时间序列表示学习性能，在分类任务上表现突出，异常检测任务表现良好。

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations
by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations.
Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the
aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the
embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both
instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we
integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to
balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings.
Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and
temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and
negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of
positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture
of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach
on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and
multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly
detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by
considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for
anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are
performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

TL;DR: 提出了ShapKAN剪枝框架，使用Shapley值评估KAN网络中节点重要性，解决了传统基于幅度的剪枝方法对输入坐标偏移敏感的问题，实现了有效的网络压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 虽然能恢复符号表示并保持竞争性性能，但其架构对网络剪枝提出了独特挑战。传统基于幅度的剪枝方法由于对输入坐标偏移敏感而不可靠。

Method: 提出ShapKAN剪枝框架，使用Shapley值归因来以平移不变的方式评估节点重要性。与基于幅度的方法不同，ShapKAN量化每个节点的实际贡献，确保重要性排名不受输入参数化影响。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，ShapKAN在实现有效网络压缩的同时保留了真实的节点重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了KAN的可解释性优势，促进了在资源受限环境中的部署。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships
is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural
networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying
functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by
employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling
recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.
However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.
Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to
input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using
Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant
manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's
actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of
input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling
effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability
advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析中，简单的融合技术往往无法处理模态质量变化（如噪声、缺失或语义冲突），导致在辨别细微情感时性能不佳。

Method: 使用双门融合机制，基于信息熵和模态重要性自适应调整特征权重，在单模态编码和跨模态交互后优先选择信息丰富的线索，减少噪声模态的影响。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上的实验表明，AGFN在准确率上显著优于强基线方法，能有效辨别细微情感且性能稳健。可视化分析显示AGFN通过减少特征位置与预测误差的相关性，学习更广泛的特征分布，增强了泛化能力。

Conclusion: AGFN通过自适应门控融合机制，有效提升了多模态情感分析的性能，特别是在处理模态质量变化和辨别细微情感方面表现出色，同时增强了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决组合优化中数据覆盖不足的问题，在缺乏先验知识的情况下基于历史客户选择数据确定最优组合。

Method: 引入悲观组合优化(PASTA)框架，仅要求离线数据分布包含最优组合而非覆盖所有可行组合。

Result: 为多项logit和嵌套logit等常用选择模型建立了首个有限样本遗憾界，证明了PASTA在样本和模型复杂度上的极小极大最优性。

Conclusion: PASTA框架在理论和实验上都优于现有基线方法，为离线组合优化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and
data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the
underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on
historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment
optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant
challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we
introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that
leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under
general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data
distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full
coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first
finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several
widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit
models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that
PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline
approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层最优传输(HOT)框架，通过联合推断全局一致的层间耦合和神经元级传输计划，解决了传统表示相似性方法在深度不匹配网络比较中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示相似性方法独立对齐每层，产生不对称结果，缺乏全局对齐分数，且难以处理不同深度的网络。这些限制源于忽略全局激活结构和限制映射为刚性的一对一层对应关系。

Method: HOT框架联合推断软性的、全局一致的层到层耦合和神经元级传输计划，允许源神经元在多个目标层间分配质量，在边际约束下最小化总传输成本。

Result: 在视觉模型、大语言模型和人类视觉皮层记录上的评估显示，HOT在比对质量上匹配或超越标准成对匹配方法，并揭示出平滑、细粒度的分层对应关系。

Conclusion: HOT能够实现更丰富、更可解释的表示比较，特别是在网络架构或深度不同的情况下，通过全局优化自然产生结构化模式。

Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.

Motivation: 在大规模流行病学研究中，需要从被动收集的手腕加速度计数据中准确识别人类活动强度，以研究体力活动与健康结果的关系。

Method: 使用151名CAPTURE-24参与者的数据，训练ActiNet模型（18层自监督改进ResNet-V2），然后进行隐马尔可夫模型平滑，使用5折分层组交叉验证评估性能。

Result: ActiNet模型平均宏观F1分数0.82，Cohen's kappa分数0.86，优于RF+HMM的0.77和0.81，在不同年龄和性别亚组中表现一致。

Conclusion: ActiNet模型适合在未来的流行病学研究中从手腕加速度计数据提取活动强度标签。

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on
passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale
epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical
activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has
generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the
extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would
make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this
may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151
CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised,
18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM)
smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this
model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then
compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing
literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared
with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The
ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean
macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the
performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with
mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent
across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet
for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data
in future epidemiological studies.

Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and
providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed
throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and
collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing
multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive
understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML
system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,
power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource
management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization
problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining
block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which
provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical
convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance
under different data settings.

### [82] [Accelerating Attention with Basis Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01718)
*Jialin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BD Attention (BDA) 是一种无损的注意力算法重构，通过基础分解矩阵恒等式重新组织多头投影，在保持精确输出的同时实现数学保证的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力是大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的核心操作，现有优化方法多为I/O感知的系统级优化，缺乏数学保证的无损加速方法。

Method: 利用基础分解(BD)的矩阵恒等式，将多头投影重新组织为紧凑形式，无需重新训练，仅需4秒离线准备即可应用。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16)上，BDA实现了32%更快的键/值投影和25%更小的权重，端到端困惑度仅增加0.02%(FP16)或0.0004%(FP32)。

Conclusion: BDA是首个理论上精确的无损注意力加速方法，与现有工程级优化互补，为模型加速提供了新的数学基础。

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first
lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple
matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head
projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike
I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a
mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On
DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with
no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value
projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity
(PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model
performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method
for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing
engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at

### [83] [Finite-Time Bounds for Distributionally Robust TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01721)
*Saptarshi Mandal,Yashaswini Murthy,R. Srikant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个使用线性函数逼近的鲁棒TD学习算法，解决了分布鲁棒强化学习中的模型不确定性，无需生成模型访问，样本复杂度为Õ(1/ε²)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒TD学习的收敛保证仅限于表格MDP或需要限制性折扣因子假设，缺乏对函数逼近的鲁棒TD学习理论保证，而实际鲁棒RL算法已取得经验成功。

Method: 结合双时间尺度随机逼近更新和外循环目标网络更新，在总变差距离和Wasserstein-l距离不确定性集下实现鲁棒性。

Result: 建立了Õ(1/ε²)的样本复杂度以获得ε-准确值估计，填补了鲁棒RL算法经验成功与非鲁棒对应物理论保证之间的关键差距。

Conclusion: 该算法是模型无关的，无需MDP生成访问，关键思想可相对直接地扩展到具有函数逼近的鲁棒Q学习。

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing
policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In
particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted
reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed
environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty
set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD)
learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on
restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We
present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where
robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and
Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both
model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm
combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop
target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a
key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the
non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key
ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to
robust Q-learning with function approximation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度神经网络(DNN)的工作地点选择建模方法，相比传统离散选择模型(DCM)能更好地理解复杂决策模式并提供更优结果。DNN在该领域显示出作为DCM稳健替代方案的显著潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散选择模型在准确反映个体决策过程方面面临挑战，需要开发能更好理解复杂决策模式的新方法。

Method: 使用深度神经网络(DNN)对工作地点选择进行建模，并与传统离散选择模型(DCM)进行比较分析。

Result: DNN在工作地点选择建模的某些方面优于DCM，而DCM在评估个体属性对工作距离影响时与数据更一致。DCM在短距离表现更好，DNN在长距离与数据和DCM表现相当。

Conclusion: 选择工作地点选择分析模型时应根据具体应用需求，两种模型各有优势，需要基于特定要求进行选择。

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace
location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual
decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)
method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand
complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete
choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant
potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models
effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location
choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM
better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes
on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs
perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings
underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific
application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私随机梯度下降（DPSGD）对模型公平性的影响，发现直接优化差分隐私模型的超参数虽然不能可靠减轻DPSGD的差异性影响，但相比重用非隐私模型的超参数能改善效用-公平性权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DPSGD训练对神经网络公平性的影响，验证直接优化差分隐私模型超参数是否能达到与非隐私模型相当的公平性水平。

Method: 通过比较DPSGD对不同性能指标的差异性影响，并在广泛的超参数设置下进行分析，同时评估DPSGD-Global-Adapt变体。

Result: 发现DPSGD对不同指标的差异性影响并不一致，直接优化差分隐私模型超参数不能可靠减轻差异性影响，但能改善效用-公平性权衡。DPSGD-Global-Adapt在超参数选择方面不够稳健。

Conclusion: 超参数调优会带来额外的隐私泄露，需要在隐私、效用和公平性之间谨慎权衡。直接优化差分隐私模型超参数虽能改善效用-公平性权衡，但不能可靠减轻DPSGD的差异性影响。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information
about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the
model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the
model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic
report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that
fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing
hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models
(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common
practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)
comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and
2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that
a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact
on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters
directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate
impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness
trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We
stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional
privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,
utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a
variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and
conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to
hyperparameter choice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督动态特征选择方法，通过移除图像中的误导性或冗余信息来增强潜在表示，提升模型性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务中的潜在表示常受噪声或无关特征影响，这会降低模型性能和泛化能力，需要一种方法来识别和移除这些不良特征。

Method: 采用无监督动态特征选择框架，对每个实例识别并移除图像中的误导性或冗余信息，仅保留最相关特征用于潜在空间构建。

Result: 在图像数据集上的实验表明，配备无监督DFS的模型在聚类和图像生成等任务中显著提升了泛化性能，计算成本增加极小。

Conclusion: 无监督动态特征选择方法能有效增强潜在表示，提高模型性能，且具有广泛适用性，不依赖标注数据。

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

TL;DR: Octax是一个基于JAX的高性能经典街机游戏环境套件，为强化学习研究提供GPU加速的替代方案，相比传统CPU模拟器实现数量级的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习研究需要多样且可扩展的环境，但现代视频游戏计算成本高且不适合大规模实验。需要提供GPU加速的替代方案来替代CPU绑定的Atari基准测试。

Method: 基于CHIP-8模拟在JAX中实现经典街机游戏环境，提供端到端的GPU加速，支持图像环境，涵盖解谜、动作和策略游戏类型。

Result: JAX实现相比传统CPU模拟器实现数量级的速度提升，同时保持原始游戏机制的完美保真度。在多个游戏中训练RL代理显示出显著的训练速度和可扩展性改进。

Conclusion: Octax为大规模强化学习实验提供了理想的平台，其模块化设计便于研究人员扩展新游戏或使用大语言模型生成新环境。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging
environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may
offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for
large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce
Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented
in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely
adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a
long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering
image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all
executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while
maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate
Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing
significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing
solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily
extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large
language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL
experimentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究分别关注基于势能的架构和退化变分积分器，但结合两者时会出现数值不稳定问题，导致长时间模拟无法进行。

Method: 提出两种训练策略：直接学习向量场，或通过方案学习时间离散动力学。

Result: 通过多个数值测试案例验证了方法学习复杂物理动力学（如回旋动力学等离子体物理中的引导中心）的能力。

Conclusion: 解决了结合势能架构和退化变分积分器时的数值不稳定问题，使长时间模拟成为可能。

Abstract: This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data,
where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the
learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either
facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate
variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In
experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test
cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics,
like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Motivation: 隐私保护合成数据生成是解决医学AI研究中数据稀缺问题的有前景方法，但后处理隐私过滤技术的有效性尚未得到充分验证。

Method: 对胸部X光合成应用过滤管道进行严格评估，分析过滤器在检测训练数据生成的近似重复样本方面的表现。

Result: 当前过滤器表现出有限的特异性和一致性，仅对真实图像实现高敏感性，但无法可靠检测训练数据生成的近似重复样本。

Conclusion: 后处理过滤方法存在关键局限性，可能提供虚假的安全感，同时仍暴露不可接受的患者信息水平。在敏感应用中使用这些方法之前，需要过滤器设计的实质性改进。

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue
for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering
techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable
information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their
effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous
evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary
to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current
filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity
only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated
from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc
filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods
may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of
patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter
design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive
applications.

TL;DR: 提出Hourglass MLP架构，颠覆传统窄-宽-窄设计，采用宽-窄-宽结构，在扩展维度上进行跳跃连接，通过窄瓶颈保持计算效率，在生成任务中表现优于传统设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统MLP的窄-宽-窄设计惯例，探索跳跃连接在扩展维度而非输入/输出维度操作的可能性，以利用高维空间进行增量优化。

Method: 提出Hourglass MLP块，使用宽-窄-宽结构，跳跃连接在扩展维度操作，残差计算通过窄瓶颈流动，初始投影可保持随机初始化不变。

Result: Hourglass架构在生成任务中始终优于传统设计，随着参数增加，最优配置趋向更深的网络、更宽的跳跃连接和更窄的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 需要重新考虑现代架构中跳跃连接的放置方式，这种设计思路可扩展到Transformer和其他残差网络。

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow
design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while
processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by
proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections
operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow
bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental
refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched
designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift
input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can
remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient
training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on
generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing
performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search.
Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto
frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase,
optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip
connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from
conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement
in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers
and other residual networks.

*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse Query Attention (SQA)通过减少查询头的数量来降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，在长序列处理中可实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，且对模型质量影响很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多头注意力机制(MHA)的二次计算复杂度限制了长序列的扩展性，现有方法如MQA和GQA虽然解决了内存带宽瓶颈，但未减少注意力得分计算所需的FLOPs，这仍然是训练和全序列处理的关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出稀疏查询注意力(SQA)架构，通过减少查询头的数量而非键/值头来直接降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，减少的因子与查询头减少比例成正比。

Result: 在长序列(32k-200k token)上的实证基准测试显示，SQA在计算受限场景(如模型预训练、微调和编码器任务)中可实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，初步小规模实验中对模型质量影响很小。

Conclusion: SQA提供了一种新的注意力优化路径，是构建更高效和可扩展模型的强大工具，该架构是在开发Reactive Transformer过程中偶然发现的。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布估计算法依赖学习显式变量依赖图，成本高且难以有效捕捉复杂交互。需要一种更高效的方法来处理组合优化问题。

Method: 使用多变量自回归生成模型，在训练过程中随机采样生成顺序（信息保留dropout），使模型对变量顺序不变，并采用广义强化策略优化进行稳定策略梯度更新。

Result: 在多种基准算法和不同规模问题实例上，该方法经常获得最佳性能，并始终避免灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 该方法通过顺序不变性提高了组合优化的样本效率和性能，在广泛基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for
black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution
algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs,
which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In
contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model
trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders
during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is
encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity
and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies,
improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates
from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms
and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best
performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

Result: 在AWS AutoGluon投资组合数据集(包含175个表格分类数据集)上应用该方法，显著减少了计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法为AutoML工作流程提供了转变，在保持选择最佳模型的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection,
with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models
for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive
hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different
types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction
emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search
through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc
prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the
intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional
models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of
AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical
information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to
the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark
containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The
proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing
computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given
dataset.

Conclusion: 该方法朝着精准诊断的统一基础模型发展，可提高预测准确性并辅助临床决策。

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable
devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in
isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations
essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal
foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early
detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management
tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,
reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a
single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the
accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

Conclusion: 模型检查可以作为学习形式语言表示的目标，为形式验证领域的表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems
against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have
shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains,
representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We
introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that
leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned
representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a
shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On
industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both
algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We
further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to
downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings
demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning
representations for formal languages.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications,
serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as

deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior
GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual
imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is
still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation
comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving
their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study
that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,
revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM
augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we
propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement
(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is
the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,
diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through
iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs
from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments
demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced
baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了LieNLSD方法，首次能够确定非线性项无穷小生成元的数量及其显式表达式，通过函数库和SVD求解系数矩阵，在动态系统和物理问题中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称性在等变网络设计和控制方程发现中广泛应用，但在复杂场景中通常未知。现有方法大多局限于线性对称性，非线性对称性发现方法无法显式获得李代数子空间。

Method: 指定无穷小群作用的函数库，求解其系数矩阵。证明微分方程的延拓公式对系数矩阵也是线性的。通过数据中心差值和神经网络雅可比矩阵代入无穷小准则，得到系数矩阵的线性方程组，用SVD求解。

Result: 在顶夸克标记和一系列动态系统上，LieNLSD相比现有方法展现出定性优势，将神经PDE求解器的长期滚动精度提高了20%以上，同时指导数据增强。

Conclusion: LieNLSD是第一个能够确定非线性项无穷小生成元数量和显式表达式的方法，在对称性发现方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant
networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it
is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited
to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail
to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD,
which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number
of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit
expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action
and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation
formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear
with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences
of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the
infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the
coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging
and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over
existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers
by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/hulx2002/LieNLSD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAIROS是一个非自回归时间序列预测框架，直接建模分段级多峰分布，避免了自回归方法的误差累积，实现了即时推理，并在多个基准测试中表现出强大的零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Web应用中，可靠的时间序列预测对于资源规划、缓存放置和异常响应至关重要，需要更快的响应速度来支持实时决策。

Method: 采用非自回归设计，直接建模分段级多峰分布，避免自回归方法的误差累积问题，同时改进了现有非自回归模型的过度平滑预测问题。

Result: 在大规模语料库上训练后，KAIROS在六个广泛使用的基准测试中表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，预测性能与类似规模的先进基础模型相当，但推理成本显著降低。

Conclusion: KAIROS突出了非自回归设计作为时间序列基础模型可扩展范式的重要性，为Web应用提供了高效的时间序列预测解决方案。

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time
series.

Result: 模型在规则学习和运动学习任务中成功恢复了真实组件和统计信息。能够从单个示例快速推断新解决方案。

Conclusion: 该框架结合了神经网络的表现力和概率推断的数据效率，实现了快速的组合式元学习。

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively
reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning.
Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly
recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for
meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that
explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable
computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the
underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks.
This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference
problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through
highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground
truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We
then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single
examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks
with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid
compositional meta-learning.

Conclusion: GRACE能够生成可解释的代码奖励函数，在多任务设置中构建复杂奖励API，相比模仿学习和在线强化学习方法具有竞争力。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert
demonstrations, but traditional methods yield "black-box" models that are
difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating
Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an
evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward
function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is
executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate
GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns
highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we
demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to
both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth
rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in
multi-task setups.

Conclusion: 提出的模块化算法框架有效解决了对抗性约束的在线凸优化问题，改进了现有技术成果。

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the celebrated Online Convex Optimization
(OCO) framework with online adversarial constraints. We present two algorithms
having simple modular structures that yield universal dynamic regret and
cumulative constraint violation bounds, improving upon the state-of-the-art

established by reducing the constrained learning problem to an instance of the
standard OCO problem with specially constructed surrogate cost functions.

Abstract: Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic to South
America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted
by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and
digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are

approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main
results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged
several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,
provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong
labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and
generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric
that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to
frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630
participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge,
representing diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型常受限于极高的内存需求，其中优化器状态占主导地位。现有工作通过将梯度投影到低维子空间来缓解这一成本，但需要更深入理解梯度空间动态特性。

Method: 分析梯度空间及其子空间的动态特性，发现梯度空间具有近似平坦的曲率特性。基于这些洞察，提出了GrassWalk和GrassJump随机算法，利用子空间特性进行优化。

Result: 在LLaMA-1B和LLaMA-7B预训练中，提出的算法实现了最先进的内存节省，同时提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 梯度空间分析揭示了核心子空间影响力随时间衰减的特性，提出的随机算法通过有效利用子空间结构，在内存效率和性能方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory
demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates
this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using
sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of
gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small
subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in
the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over
time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits
near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this
geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized
algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve
state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and
LLaMA-7B pretraining.

Result: 在数学和规划基准任务上训练开源大扩散语言模型，结果显示该方法在减少函数评估次数的同时获得更好准确率，在推理计算帕累托前沿上取得最佳性能。

Conclusion: DiFFPO框架成功统一了扩散大语言模型的性能提升和效率优化，通过强化学习实现了推理能力更强且速度更快的训练目标。

Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified
framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason
not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We
first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train
surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable
as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more
accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with
importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with
better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a
new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy.
Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by
letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each
prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower
number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only,
obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the
inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline
by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and
planning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然动态过程只能通过静态样本快照观察，但重建其时间演化以揭示潜在动态特性对科学研究至关重要。现有方法在高维情况下可扩展性差且需要严格假设。

Method: 推导了迭代马尔可夫拟合算法，以新颖的因子化方式扩展到多边际情况，基于扩散Schrödinger桥匹配理论。

Result: 在玩具示例上保留了理论特性，在真实世界数据集上达到最先进性能，首次在非常高维图像设置中恢复耦合和动态。

Conclusion: 多边际Schrödinger桥为从静态数据恢复隐藏动态提供了一种实用且有原则的方法。

Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or
disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample
snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to
decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific
research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but
are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be
met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal
temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video
generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and
empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching
(arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting
algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show
that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic
trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers
couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work
establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled
approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的在线策略训练在单次更新后丢弃经验，导致计算效率低下和不稳定。需要探索经验特性如何影响大型推理模型的学习动态。

Method: 提出ExGRPO框架，识别推理经验的价值指标（正确性和熵），组织并优先利用有价值的经验，采用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用。

Result: 在五个骨干模型（1.5B-8B参数）上，ExGRPO在数学/通用基准上平均比在线RLVR提升3.5/7.6分，并在强/弱模型上稳定训练。

Conclusion: 原则性的经验管理是高效可扩展RLVR的关键要素。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Motivation: 研究如何应对采用动态策略选择信道和感知阈值的反应式干扰器，这种干扰器能够检测并干扰正在进行的传输。

Method: 使用强化学习（RL），包括Q-learning处理离散干扰事件状态，以及深度Q网络（DQN）处理基于接收功率的连续状态。通过不同的奖励函数和动作集来优化传输功率、调制和信道选择。

Result: 结果表明强化学习能够快速适应频谱动态变化，在信道和干扰策略随时间变化时仍能维持高传输速率。

Conclusion: 强化学习是应对反应式干扰的有效方法，能够在缺乏先验知识的情况下自适应优化通信性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over
time.

Motivation: Tsetlin Machine作为一种基于有限状态自动机和命题逻辑的机器学习方法，相比神经网络具有更好的可解释性。本文旨在探索TM架构在复杂大规模多通道图像分类任务中的适用性。

Method: 提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法论。局部解释用于解释模型预测，全局类别表示聚合每个类别的重要模式。这些解释总结了卷积子句捕获的知识，可以可视化为图像。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到98.5%准确率，在CelebA数据集上达到86.56% F1分数（相比ResNet50的88.07%）。TM在保持可解释性的同时，性能与深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: Tsetlin Machine在复杂大规模训练环境中能够保持竞争力，同时维持其可解释性优势。这有助于更好地理解TM子句，并为将这类模型应用于更复杂多样的数据集提供了见解。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs
finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to
represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more
interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The
Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as
MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the
applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image
classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations
and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to
explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate
important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the
knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as
images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that
achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to
88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively
to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in
large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better
understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be
applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

Conclusion: 需要改进LLM不确定性估计方法的评估框架，采用更稳健的风险指标和客观的总结方法，以确保评估结果的可靠性和可比性。

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large
language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of
hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive
uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating
predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been
developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty
estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)
datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate
correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,
consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows
one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We
propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation
experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms
for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge
variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore
structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection
tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we
propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an
objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低秩适应(LoRA)方法在性能上仍落后于完全微调，部分原因是对低秩流形几何结构利用不足。

Method: 使用三因子分解U、S、V⊤，将U和V约束在Stiefel流形上保持正交性，采用几何优化设计将欧几里得优化器转换为黎曼优化器。

Result: 在常识推理、数学和代码生成、图像分类、图像生成等广泛下游任务中，性能优于当前最先进的LoRA变体。

Conclusion: 提出的几何感知LoRA扩展方法通过更好地利用低秩流形的几何结构，显著提升了参数高效微调的性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient
technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still
lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient
exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this
paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor
decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value
decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$
and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie
on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training.
To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric
optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one.
It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing
fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream
tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image
classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA. Code is

Result: 通过三个案例研究证明，该框架实现了更好的训练稳定性、降低对初始超参数的敏感性、提高对用户需求变化的适应性

Conclusion: 为未来AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定性和优化训练动态的训练范式铺平道路

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上达到1.90 FID，超越传统扩散/流模型，并能处理部分噪声图像去噪、OOD检测和图像合成等任务。

Conclusion: EqM通过统一平衡景观替代时间条件速度，提供了流模型与能量模型之间的紧密桥梁，以及优化驱动推理的简单途径。

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework
built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the
non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Conclusion: Moon框架通过模态转换和多模态融合有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在异常检测效率和准确性方面表现出色，同时提供详细的异常分析报告

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns
where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly
detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,
prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two
key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based
and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to
inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often
underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised
learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture
local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a
supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection
framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while
providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel
multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time
series data into image representations, capturing relationships across
variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that
cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a
Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion
model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a
SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to
anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world
MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by
up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation
performance.

Conclusion: 研究为扩散模型成功归因于适应数据低维几何结构提供了证据，表明平滑机制在控制模型泛化行为中起关键作用。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating
remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the
mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially
understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes
this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure
within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on
how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem
through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by
investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score
matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that
smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density
domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we
show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be
controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better
reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making
across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a
global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be
centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as
healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated
private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the
integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically,
we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram
binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new
methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a
federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and
demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose
strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and
our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for
DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

Conclusion: 几何信息引导的探索为抗菌肽设计提供了强大的新范式，能够高效发现具有广谱抗菌活性的新型肽。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of
peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models
provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore
decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering
exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based
remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in
practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware
framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a
Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family
of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring
computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order
Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent
second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation
Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete
amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian
Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.
Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which
interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,
biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro
validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel
seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active
peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial
strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides
a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督图异常检测方法仅基于标注的正常节点学习正态性，容易过拟合，导致高误报率。需要利用未标注数据来校准正态性

Method: GraphNC包含两个组件：异常分数分布对齐(ScoreDA)和基于扰动的正态正则化(NormReg)。ScoreDA对齐学生模型与教师模型的异常分数分布，NormReg通过在标注节点上最小化扰动一致性损失来正则化表示空间的正态性

Result: 通过分数对齐使正常和异常类别的异常分数更分离，通过表示正则化使正常节点表示更紧凑，从而减少教师模型不准确分数的影响

Conclusion: GraphNC能有效校准图数据的正态性，在半监督图异常检测中取得更好的性能

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial
ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised
GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during
training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the
normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the
labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These
can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome
this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework
that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from
a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly
score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,
anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality
regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by
aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to
accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in
the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of
the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more
separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the
teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed
to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the
representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a
perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair
and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI
systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As
evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust
representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing
algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for
prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that
utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior
robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing
interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in
these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we
introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address
bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically
selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing
state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum
trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in
various downstream tasks.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle
in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong
performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely
connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the
deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a
framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local
feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases)
within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes
standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the
densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in
contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in
prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control
perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to
its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of
optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise
linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a
mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further
suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一流模型在不同性质的后验分布上表现不一致，需要一种能适应多种分布形状和模态的稳健变分推断方法。

Method: 使用异质混合流模型，分两阶段训练：1）顺序专家训练单个流；2）基于似然的全局权重自适应估计，无需逐样本门控或架构修改。

Result: 在六个典型后验分布族上，AMF-VI始终获得比单一流基线更低的负对数似然，并在Wasserstein-2和最大均值差异指标上表现稳定提升。

Conclusion: 自适应混合多样化流模型为跨不同后验分布族的稳健变分推断提供了可靠途径，同时保留了每个专家的归纳偏置，且计算开销最小。

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex
posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across
qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow
Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows
(MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of
individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via
likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes.
Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons,
rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower
negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable
gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD),
indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is
efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to
standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse
flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families
whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as
heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via
photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer
physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate.
However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning,
creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and
sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model
that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters.
Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast,
robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG
signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico
experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters
under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward
PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while
supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的权重空间学习方法，可以直接从Hugging Face等非结构化模型仓库中学习权重表示，无需依赖精心构建的模型动物园。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前权重空间学习需要大量精心构建的模型动物园，这需要大量计算资源，限制了权重空间表示的规模和灵活性。

Method: 设计了一种新的权重空间骨干网络来处理非结构化模型群体，直接从Hugging Face等异构模型仓库中学习权重表示。

Result: 在Hugging Face模型上训练的权重空间表示表现出色，通常优于在实验室生成的模型动物园上训练的骨干网络，并能泛化到未见过的数据模态。

Conclusion: 高质量权重空间表示可以在非结构化环境中学习，证明精心构建的模型动物园并非不可或缺，克服了权重空间学习社区当前面临的重要限制。

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving
rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is
that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,
carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as
model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large
computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations
in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a
weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,
unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model
zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in
architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the
methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight
space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We
demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging
Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on
laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the
model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize
to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space
representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are
not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by
the weight space learning community.

TL;DR: 提出了惩罚指数损失（PENEX），这是一种新的多类指数损失公式，可通过一阶方法优化，在理论和实证上都显示能隐式最大化数据点边界，并可作为AdaBoost的替代方案用于深度神经网络训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdaBoost在实践中随着弱学习器数量增加而泛化良好，但其指数损失难以通过一阶方法优化。现有方法如交叉熵损失对误分类数据的惩罚不如指数损失严格。

Method: 提出PENEX损失函数，这是一种理论上有依据的多类指数损失公式，可通过梯度下降等一阶方法进行优化，并隐式参数化提升框架中的弱学习器。

Result: 在计算机视觉和语言任务中，PENEX表现出比类似计算成本的现有方法更好的正则化效果，能够隐式最大化数据点边界。

Conclusion: PENEX作为AdaBoost启发的替代方案，在深度神经网络训练和微调中具有有效潜力，提供了理论上有依据且易于优化的指数损失实现。

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential
loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss
functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in
practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we
introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the
multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to
the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes
margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX
implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across
computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing
effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.
Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for
effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

Motivation: 伊朗作为世界第二大天然气储量国，面临冬季压力下降和供应中断问题，需要控制居民部门（最大消费部门）的天然气消费。

Method: 使用机器学习模型（LSTM、GRU和混合BiLSTM-XGBoost），基于2017-2022年天然气消费和气象数据进行分析和预测。

Result: 混合BiLSTM-XGBoost模型在RMSE、MAPE和MPE指标上表现最优，在数据有限情况下也展现稳健性能。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法特别是混合模型能有效预测天然气消费，有助于资源管理和减少季节性短缺，地理和气候因素在预测建模中至关重要。

Abstract: Today, natural gas, as a clean fuel and the best alternative to crude oil,
covers a significant part of global demand. Iran is one of the largest
countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest
country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy
consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in
cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,
especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This
study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in
Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and
a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and
meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were
trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption
patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model
outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean
Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust
performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest
that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be
effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to
more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study
highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in
predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across
different regions.

*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端框架，用于在大规模空间融合和实体匹配任务中实现精确的召回率控制，通过集成多个阈值估计器来减少方差，并在TPU上高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在空间融合和实体匹配任务中，精确的召回率控制至关重要，因为漏掉少量真实匹配会破坏下游分析，而过度的手动审查会增加成本。现有方法如Clopper-Pearson或Wilson置信区间通常会超出目标几个百分点，且在偏斜分数分布下运行间方差较高。

Method: 采用端到端框架，包括：1）使用等网格边界框过滤器和压缩稀疏行候选表示减少对枚举；2）通过确定性xxHash引导样本训练轻量级神经排序器；3）构建可重现的分数十分位分层校准集；4）集成四种阈值估计器（Clopper-Pearson、Jeffreys、Wilson和精确分位数），通过逆方差加权融合九个独立子样本。

Result: 在两个真实地籍数据集（约631万和6734万对）上评估，该方法始终在较小误差内达到召回目标，相比其他校准方法减少了冗余验证，并在单个TPU v3核心上端到端运行。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在大规模几何对中实现精确的召回控制，具有亚百分点的方差，同时保持TPU友好性，显著提高了空间融合和实体匹配任务的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

TL;DR: DECOR是一种用于线性高斯结构方程模型的联合学习方法，能够同时学习DAG和相关噪声模型，在存在潜在混淆的情况下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在误差独立时表现良好，但去混淆流程依赖普遍因子结构或非线性。需要一种能够在存在潜在混淆的情况下有效学习结构的方法。

Method: 提出DECOR方法，基于单一似然函数且完全可微，交替进行平滑无环图更新和凸噪声更新，可包含轻量弓形互补惩罚或后处理协调步骤。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，DECOR匹配或优于强基线方法，特别在混淆非普遍时表现稳健，在普遍混淆情况下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: DECOR为存在潜在混淆的线性高斯SEMs提供了一种有效的联合学习方法，理论保证了在弓形自由图和均匀特征值边界条件下的全局参数可识别性。

Abstract: We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of
latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are
independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor
structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc{DECOR}, a single likelihood-based
and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated
noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter
identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a
uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the
observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the
noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph
update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity
penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary
confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$,
\textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust
when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under
pervasiveness.

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the
adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations
in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen
energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However,
the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process
remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative
model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and
adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts.
We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept
application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for
which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst.
In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution
reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open
the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework
offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient
catalysts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将扩散模型中成功的引导技术扩展到强化学习领域，使标准在线强化学习方法具备类似扩散策略的可控性。

Method: 在策略梯度中引入无条件分支，通过插值条件分支和无条件分支实现引导，理论证明在优势估计下额外归一化项会消失，得到简洁的引导策略梯度更新公式。

Result: 在离散和连续控制基准测试中，条件丢弃在简单离散任务和低样本情况下有效，但会破坏连续控制的稳定性；适度增大引导系数能持续改善稳定性、样本效率和可控性。

Conclusion: 引导技术可以从扩散策略成功扩展到标准在线策略方法，为可控在线强化学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of
classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient
methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and
interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time
control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a
theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes
under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update.
Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We
find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in
simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes
continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$)
consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our
results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be
adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable
online reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: Poolformer是一种序列到序列模型，用循环层替代自注意力机制并引入池化操作来减少序列长度，在处理长序列时优于现有最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在序列长度上具有二次复杂度，限制了其在超长序列上的实用性，需要更高效的架构来处理长序列数据。

Method: 使用递归定义的SkipBlocks结构，包含残差块、下池化层、嵌套SkipBlock、上池化层和额外残差块，用循环层替代自注意力机制。

Result: 池化操作显著加速训练，改善感知指标（FID和IS），防止过拟合，在原始音频数据上优于SaShiMi和Mamba等最先进模型。

Conclusion: Poolformer在处理长序列方面表现出色，深层次处理长程依赖，浅层次处理短期特征，未来可扩展到文本、视觉和多模态应用。

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process
dense representations of images and videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准主要测试静态知识问答，无法捕捉交易的动态和迭代特性，而金融领域对经济价值和高风险决策具有直接相关性，但尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入StockBench基准，让代理接收每日市场信号（价格、基本面、新闻），做出买入、卖出或持有的顺序决策，使用累计回报、最大回撤和索提诺比率等金融指标评估性能。

Result: 评估最先进的专有和开源模型显示，大多数LLM代理难以超越买入持有基准，但部分模型能够提供更高回报并更有效地管理风险。

Conclusion: 在静态金融知识任务表现出色并不一定转化为成功的交易策略，StockBench作为开源资源发布以支持可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

Conclusion: 通过利用注意力机制在因子分解机中进行共享嵌入选择，并采用辅助学习处理数据异质性，能够有效提升模型性能，特别是在少数群体上的表现。

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective
implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world
data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional
distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is
used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,
neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning
ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this
paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in
factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address
this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those
with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous
research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to
mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to
regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning
process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority
cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive
production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.
Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained
user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%
reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on
targeted minority cohorts.

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型只能预测每个时间步的独立边际分布，而非完整的联合预测分布。生成具有现实相关结构的预测样本路径通常需要昂贵的自回归采样。

Method: 使用copula方法，通过一次前向传递从现有的多步时间序列基础模型生成相关的样本路径。

Result: copula方法生成相关样本路径的速度比自回归采样快几个数量级，并通过减轻误差累积现象提高了样本路径质量。

Conclusion: copula方法为从多步时间序列基础模型生成相关样本路径提供了一种高效准确的替代方案。

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

Conclusion: xLSTM在扩展规律方面优于Transformer，特别是在长上下文场景下表现更佳，这为未来大语言模型架构选择提供了重要参考

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute
budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant
architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with
respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter
regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of
Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide
future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for
xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and
parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of
training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model
sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous
work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings
reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales
favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as
training and inference contexts grow.

TL;DR: 提出PUL-Inter-Slice Defender方法，使用正无标签学习和LSTM自编码器结合K-Means聚类，保护5G网络切片免受分布式切片移动攻击，在攻击污染数据中实现超过98.50%的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中用户设备可以在多个网络切片间无缝切换，这种灵活性可能被利用发起分布式切片移动攻击，需要开发有效的安全防护方案。

Method: 采用正无标签学习，结合长短期记忆自编码器和K-Means聚类，使用3GPP关键性能指标和性能测量计数器作为特征来检测攻击。

Result: 在基于free5GC和UERANSIM的5G测试床上评估，当训练数据包含10%到40%攻击污染时，F1分数超过98.50%，优于其他对比方法。

Conclusion: PUL-Inter-Slice Defender能有效检测分布式切片移动攻击，在受污染训练数据下保持鲁棒性，为5G网络切片安全提供可靠保护。

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its
counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

*Tobias Kreiman,Yutong Bai,Fadi Atieh,Elizabeth Weaver,Eric Qu,Aditi S. Krishnapriyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明纯Transformer模型无需预定义图结构或物理先验，仅基于笛卡尔坐标就能在分子能量和力预测任务上达到与最先进等变GNN相当的性能，并展现出可预测的缩放能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在分子建模中使用硬编码的图结构（如固定半径截断或k近邻），这限制了表达能力并降低了推理速度。研究者希望探索Transformer能否在没有图结构或物理先验的情况下学习分子性质。

Method: 使用标准Transformer架构，直接基于笛卡尔坐标进行训练，不引入预定义的图结构或物理先验知识。在OMol25数据集上与等变GNN在相同计算预算下进行对比。

Result: Transformer在能量和力预测上达到了与最先进等变GNN相当的MAE性能。模型自适应地学习了物理一致性模式，如注意力权重随原子间距离呈反比衰减，并能灵活适应不同分子环境。

Conclusion: Transformer能够自适应地学习GNN的有利特性，挑战了硬编码图归纳偏置的必要性，为分子建模提供了标准化、可扩展的架构选择。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular
machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on
predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor
scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular
tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive
field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we
investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian
coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical
priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a
starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to
competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training
compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25
dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent
patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with
interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different
molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a
standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to
scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in
other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs
can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded
graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures
for molecular modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion^2是一种基于扩散模型的方法，使用3D点云来建模从Wi-Fi到毫米波的各种频率的RF信号传播，比现有方法快27倍且误差仅为1.9 dB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RF信号传播建模对于环境理解和无线网络诊断部署至关重要，但复杂环境中的准确预测仍具挑战性，因为RF信号会受到吸收和反射等障碍物交互的影响。

Method: 提出了RF-3D编码器从3D数据中捕捉RF相关特征，通过多尺度嵌入模拟实际RF信号传播过程，使用扩散模型进行建模。

Result: 在合成和真实世界测量中的评估表明，Diffusion^2能准确估计不同频段和环境条件下的RF信号行为，误差仅为1.9 dB，比现有方法快27倍。

Conclusion: Diffusion^2在RF信号传播建模领域取得了显著进展，为无线网络诊断、部署和优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for
understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the
capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,
lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless
diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF
signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with
obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a
diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of
RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.
To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D
Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with
signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to
simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on
synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately
estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and
environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster
than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field. Refer to

Conclusion: 新数据集和建模见解将为交通预测研究提供宝贵资源，提出的替代方法在可扩展性和预测性能方面都表现更好。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant
practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from
the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks
(GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic
forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available
benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information
about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about
road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls
short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain
information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city
road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much
denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide
a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting
by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with
the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold
increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road
features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic
speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show
that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic
forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this
issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that
uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus
achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger
forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve
as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

TL;DR: 提出Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS)方法，用于预训练离散扩散基础模型的后验采样，在图像恢复任务中实现最先进性能，无需重新训练任务特定模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在分类数据建模方面具有统一框架、更快推理和训练自由贝叶斯推理等优势，但现有离散扩散后验采样方法面临信号稀疏、连续松弛限制和维度灾难等挑战。

Method: 基于两个关键创新：在离散嵌入空间中使用量化期望实现梯度式引导，以及自适应解码的锚定重掩码技术。

Result: 在标准基准测试的线性和非线性逆问题上，APS方法在离散扩散采样器中达到最先进性能，并在训练自由的风格化和文本引导编辑中展现优势。

Conclusion: APS方法成功克服了离散扩散后验采样的主要挑战，为预训练离散扩散基础模型的后验采样提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

Conclusion: CNS实现了无融合操作，减少了持续个性化所需的内存存储和处理时间，为扩散模型的增量学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in
real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the
target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while
preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and
processing time for continual personalization.

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to
determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,
under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's
API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model

synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our
approach is applicable to both classification and generative models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LEGO方法，利用图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度正交化来估计数据流形的切空间，相比标准LPCA方法在噪声环境下更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准局部主成分分析(LPCA)在高噪声环境下存在邻域大小选择的临界权衡问题，需要先验的几何和噪声特性知识，而这些信息通常不可得。

Method: LEGO方法通过正交化图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度来估计每个数据点的切空间，利用数据的全局结构指导局部切空间估计。

Result: 实验表明LEGO产生的切空间估计比LPCA对噪声显著更鲁棒，在流形学习、边界检测和局部内在维度估计等下游任务中表现明显改善。

Conclusion: LEGO方法通过利用全局结构信息，有效解决了高噪声环境下流形切空间估计的挑战，为数据流形分析提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in
data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in
choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior
knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often
unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector
Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the
data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on
local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by
orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a
differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows
that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align
closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high
gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.
Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency
eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are
significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked
improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,
and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

TL;DR: KaVa框架通过自蒸馏将教师模型的压缩KV缓存知识蒸馏到潜在推理学生模型中，解决了潜在推理缺乏监督的问题，在保持效率的同时提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式思维链推理计算成本高且包含冗余信息，而潜在推理虽然高效但缺乏有效监督，限制了其在复杂自然语言推理中的效果。

Method: 提出KaVa框架，利用压缩KV缓存作为监督信号，通过自蒸馏将教师模型的KV轨迹知识对齐到潜在推理学生模型的连续潜在标记中。

Result: 该方法在潜在推理基准上表现优于强基线，从方程推理到自然语言推理的性能下降显著减小，且能扩展到更大骨干网络同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 压缩KV缓存蒸馏为潜在推理提供了可扩展的监督信号，结合了思维链训练的准确性和潜在推理的效率与可部署性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant
computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic
artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that
internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of
supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning
traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this
gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher
into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the
representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV
trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within
compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a
rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the
approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly
smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales
to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish
compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent
reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency
and deployability of latent inference.

Result: 在重尾噪声条件下建立了达到近似随机稳定点的迭代复杂度，与集中式算法的最优复杂度界限相匹配。数值实验表明在不同网络拓扑下，DeMuon相比其他去中心化算法有明显改进。

Conclusion: DeMuon是Muon到图结构去中心化优化的首个直接扩展，具有可证明的复杂度保证，并在不同连通度的图上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose DeMuon, a method for decentralized matrix
optimization over a given communication topology. DeMuon incorporates matrix
orthogonalization via Newton-Schulz iterations-a technique inherited from its
centralized predecessor, Muon-and employs gradient tracking to mitigate
heterogeneity among local functions. Under heavy-tailed noise conditions and
additional mild assumptions, we establish the iteration complexity of DeMuon
for reaching an approximate stochastic stationary point. This complexity result
matches the best-known complexity bounds of centralized algorithms in terms of
dependence on the target tolerance. To the best of our knowledge, DeMuon is the
first direct extension of Muon to decentralized optimization over graphs with
provable complexity guarantees. We conduct preliminary numerical experiments on
decentralized transformer pretraining over graphs with varying degrees of
connectivity. Our numerical results demonstrate a clear margin of improvement
of DeMuon over other popular decentralized algorithms across different network
topologies.

Abstract: This paper presents an analytical and computational framework for optimizing
gas withdrawal in reconstructed ring-type pipeline systems under unsteady flow
conditions. As urban and industrial energy demands grow, repurposing existing
pipeline infrastructure offers a cost-effective alternative to full-scale
expansion. The proposed model identifies the hydraulic coupling point (where
the pressure gradient vanishes) as the optimal location for connecting new
consumers. By employing a one-dimensional unsteady gas flow model with
time-dependent mass extraction represented via a Heaviside step function, the
system's dynamic response is captured in detail. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that connecting additional loads at the pressure maximum ensures
stability while minimizing operational disruptions. The model's validation
through benchmark comparison and pressure tolerance thresholds confirms its
practical applicability. Economic analysis reveals substantial savings over
conventional expansion methods. The approach provides a scalable solution for
smart gas network design.

Conclusion: 通过将神经网络攻击重新用于优化子程序，并与无导数优化技术结合，能够有效解决涉及神经网络的优化问题，在保持数值可靠性的同时实现高效优化。

Abstract: This paper tackles optimization problems whose objective and constraints
involve a trained Neural Network (NN), where the goal is to maximize
$f(\Phi(x))$ subject to $c(\Phi(x)) \leq 0$, with $f$ smooth, $c$ general and
non-stringent, and $\Phi$ an already trained and possibly nonwhite-box NN. We
address two challenges regarding this problem: identifying ascent directions
for local search, and ensuring reliable convergence towards relevant local
solutions. To this end, we re-purpose the notion of directional NN attacks as
efficient optimization subroutines, since directional NN attacks use the neural
structure of $\Phi$ to compute perturbations of $x$ that steer $\Phi(x)$ in
prescribed directions. Precisely, we develop an attack operator that computes
attacks of $\Phi$ at any $x$ along the direction $\nabla f(\Phi(x))$. Then, we
propose a hybrid algorithm combining the attack operator with derivative-free
optimization (DFO) techniques, designed for numerical reliability by remaining
oblivious to the structure of the problem. We consider the cDSM algorithm,
which offers asymptotic guarantees to converge to a local solution under mild
assumptions on the problem. The resulting method alternates between
attack-based steps for heuristic yet fast local intensification and cDSM steps
for certified convergence and numerical reliability. Experiments on three
problems show that this hybrid approach consistently outperforms standard DFO
baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了双层优化问题，并通过实用的双准则停止条件有效应对了原始-对偶收敛速率不对称的实际挑战。

Abstract: Bilevel optimization provides a powerful framework for modeling hierarchical
decision-making systems. This work presents a novel sensitivity-based algorithm
that directly addresses the bilevel structure by treating the lower-level
optimal solution as an implicit function of the upper-level variables, thus
avoiding classical single-level reformulations. This implicit problem is solved
within a robust Augmented Lagrangian framework, where the inner subproblems are
managed by a quasi-Newton (L-BFGS-B) solver to handle the ill-conditioned and
non-smooth landscapes that can arise. The validity of the proposed method is
established through both theoretical convergence guarantees and extensive
computational experiments. These experiments demonstrate the algorithm's
efficiency and robustness and validate the use of a pragmatic dual-criterion
stopping condition to address the practical challenge of asymmetric primal-dual
convergence rates.

coordinates only with neighboring fusion centers. Under standard assumptions of
smoothness, strong convexity, and locality on the objective function, together
with polynomial growth conditions on the underlying graph, we establish
exponential convergence of the DAC iterations and derive explicit bounds for
both exact and inexact local solvers. Numerical experiments on three
representative losses ($L_2$ distance, quadratic, and entropy) confirm the
theory and demonstrate scalability and effectiveness.

### [152] [Tightness of SDP and Burer-Monteiro Factorization for Phase Synchronization in High-Noise Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01522)
*Anderson Ye Zhang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文研究了相位同步问题中最大似然估计(MLE)与其半定规划(SDP)松弛在高噪声机制下的差异，发现两者偏差呈指数级小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究已确定在低噪声机制下SDP与MLE重合，但在高噪声机制下的行为仍不清楚，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 开发了超越现有ℓ∞分析的精细化逐项分析技术，并研究了包含SDP作为特例的Burer-Monteiro(BM)分解方法。

Result: 在高噪声机制下，SDP与MLE的偏差为exp(-c n/σ²)，呈指数级小；在低噪声机制下两者重合。

Conclusion: BM分解在高噪声机制下与MLE呈指数级小偏差，在低噪声机制下与MLE重合，为相位同步问题提供了更全面的理论分析。

Abstract: We study the difference between the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and
its semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation for the phase synchronization
problem, where $n$ latent phases are estimated based on pairwise observations
corrupted by Gaussian noise at a level $\sigma$. While previous studies have
established that SDP coincides with the MLE when $\sigma \lesssim \sqrt{n /
\log n}$, the behavior in the high-noise regime $\sigma \gtrsim \sqrt{n / \log
n}$ remains unclear. We address this gap by quantifying the deviation between
the SDP and the MLE in the high-noise regime as $\exp(-c \frac{n}{\sigma^2})$,
indicating an exponentially small discrepancy. In fact, we establish more
general results for the Burer-Monteiro (BM) factorization that covers the SDP
as a special case: it has the exponentially small deviation from the MLE in the
high-noise regime and coincides with the MLE when $\sigma$ is small. To obtain
our results, we develop a refined entrywise analysis of the MLE that is beyond
the existing $\ell_\infty$ analysis in literature.

Motivation: 秩约束矩阵问题在科学和工程中频繁出现，迭代算法的收敛分析通常依赖于局部误差界，但现有结果中的指数通常没有明确确定。

Method: 通过数学分析建立局部Hölderian误差界，显式地确定了误差界中的指数，该指数由问题的维度给出。

Result: 证明了在任意紧集上，到可行集的距离可由自然残差函数的幂来界定，指数与问题维度相关。

Conclusion: 这为解集的几何性质提供了基本的定量结果，为广泛数值方法的收敛分析铺平了道路。

Abstract: Rank-constrained matrix problems appear frequently across science and
engineering. The convergence analysis of iterative algorithms developed for
these problems often hinges on local error bounds, which correlate the distance
to the feasible set with a measure of how much the constraints are violated.
Foundational results in semi-algebraic geometry guarantee that such bounds
exist, yet the associated exponents are generally not explicitly determined.
This paper establishes a local H\"olderian error bound with an explicit
exponent for the canonical rank-constrained affine feasibility set. This paper
proves that, on any compact set, the distance to the feasible set is bounded by
a power of a natural residual function capturing violations in both the rank
and affine constraints. The exponent in this bound is given explicitly in terms
of the problem's dimensions. This provides a fundamental quantitative result on
the geometry of the solution set, paving the way for the convergence analysis
of a broad class of numerical methods.

Abstract: Let ($\Omega$, $\mu$) be a measure space with $\Omega$ $\subset$ R d and
$\mu$ a finite measure on $\Omega$. We provide an extension of the Mean Value
Theorem (MVT) in the form It is valid for non compact sets $\Omega$ and f is
only required to be integrable with respect to $\mu$. It also contains as a
special case the MVT in the form f d$\mu$ = $\mu$($\Omega$)f (x 0 ) for some x
0 $\in$ $\Omega$, valid for compact connected set $\Omega$ and continuous f .
It is a direct consequence of Richter's theorem which in turn is a non trivial
(overlooked) generalization of Tchakaloff's theorem, and even published
earlier.

Conclusion: 正则化贝叶斯说服框架在保持理论严谨性的同时提高了计算可行性和鲁棒性，为复杂环境中的说服问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We study a regularized variant of the Bayesian Persuasion problem, where the
receiver's decision process includes a divergence-based penalty that accounts
for deviations from perfect rationality. This modification smooths the
underlying optimization landscape and mitigates key theoretical issues, such as
measurability and ill-posedness, commonly encountered in the classical
formulation. It also enables the use of scalable second-order optimization
methods to compute numerically the optimal signaling scheme in a setting known
to be NP-hard. We present theoretical results comparing the regularized and
original models, including convergence guarantees and structural properties of
optimal signaling schemes. Analytical examples and numerical simulations
illustrate how this framework accommodates complex environments while remaining
tractable and robust. A companion Python library, BASIL, makes use of all the
practical insights from this article.

*Georg Schildbach*

TL;DR: 本文提出了死拍鲁棒模型预测控制(DRMPC)的详细设计方法，该方法无需计算鲁棒正不变集，解决了传统鲁棒MPC在大规模系统中的应用限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒MPC方法受限于计算鲁棒正不变集(RPI)的复杂性，只能应用于小规模线性系统(约5个状态变量)。需要开发适用于大规模系统的鲁棒MPC方法。

Method: 采用死拍鲁棒模型预测控制(DRMPC)方法，该方法不依赖RPI集，通过设计特定的控制策略来保证系统理论性质。生成的优化控制问题与名义MPC具有相同的计算复杂度。

Result: DRMPC方法能够处理大规模线性系统，数值研究验证了该方法在各种维度随机生成的大规模线性系统中的适用性。

Conclusion: DRMPC是首个不依赖RPI集但具备完整系统理论保证的鲁棒MPC方法，特别适用于大规模系统，计算复杂度与名义MPC相同。

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches of Robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) are
restricted to linear systems of relatively small scale, i.e., with no more than
about 5 states. The main reason is the computational burden of determining a
robust positively invariant (RPI) set, whose complexity suffers from the curse
of dimensionality. The recently proposed approach of Deadbeat Robust Model
Predictive Control (DRMPC) is the first that does not rely on an RPI set. Yet
it comes with the full set of essential system theoretic guarantees. DRMPC is
hence a viable option, in particular, for large-scale systems. This paper
introduces a detailed design procedure for DRMPC. It is shown that the optimal
control problem generated for DRMPC has exactly the same computational
complexity as Nominal MPC. A numerical study validates its applicability to
randomly generated large-scale linear systems of various dimensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中心路径在优化研究中具有重要地位，但过去主要关注其算法应用，很少被当作低维美学实体来欣赏。本文旨在探索中心路径在艺术创作中的潜力。

Method: 在二维和三维空间中研究中心路径的美学特性，将其转化为艺术性的平铺图案和花朵状构造，结合数学原理与艺术设计。

Result: 创作出了一系列富有想象力和吸引力的图案，这些图案不仅限于计算机生成图像，还可用于数学美学设计，制作新颖物品和博物馆级别的艺术品。

Conclusion: 中心路径不仅是优化算法的重要工具，在低维空间中还具有显著的美学价值，能够产生兼具数学严谨性和艺术美感的作品。

Abstract: The central path revolutionized the study of optimization in the 1980s and
1990s due to its favorable convergence properties, and as such, it has been
investigated analytically, algorithmically, and computationally. Past pursuits
have primarily focused on linking iterative approximation algorithms to the
central path in the design of efficient algorithms to solve large, and
sometimes novel, optimization problems. This algorithmic intent has meant that
the central path has rarely been celebrated as an aesthetic entity in low
dimensions, with the only meager exceptions being illustrative examples in
textbooks. We undertake this low dimensional investigation and illustrate the
artistic use of the central path to create aesthetic tilings and flower-like
constructs in two and three dimensions, an endeavor that combines mathematical
rigor and artistic sensibilities. The result is a fanciful and enticing
collection of patterns that, beyond computer generated images, supports
math-aesthetic designs for novelties and museum-quality pieces of art.

TL;DR: 本文解决了约束类星凸函数优化问题，提出了一个近似加速近端点算法，实现了近乎最优的查询复杂度，并改进了黎曼优化的加速解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 设计了一个近似加速近端点算法，使用一阶方法实现，并分析了投影梯度下降和Frank-Wolfe算法在约束类星凸设置下的性能。

Result: 实现了近乎最优的 $\widetilde{O}(1/(\gamma\sqrt{\epsilon}))$ 一阶查询复杂度，改进了Martínez-Rubio (2022) 中加速黎曼优化的复杂度。

Conclusion: 本文首次分析了带一般凸约束的类星凸光滑函数的一阶方法，解决了该领域的开放性问题，为相关应用提供了有效的优化工具。

Abstract: Quasar-convex functions form a broad nonconvex class with applications to
linear dynamical systems, generalized linear models, and Riemannian
optimization, among others. Current nearly optimal algorithms work only in
affine spaces due to the loss of one degree of freedom when working with
general convex constraints. Obtaining an accelerated algorithm that makes
nearly optimal $\widetilde{O}(1/(\gamma\sqrt{\epsilon}))$ first-order queries
to a $\gamma$-quasar convex smooth function \emph{with constraints} was
independently asked as an open problem in Mart\'inez-Rubio (2022); Lezane,
Langer, and Koolen (2024). In this work, we solve this question by designing an
inexact accelerated proximal point algorithm that we implement using a
first-order method achieving the aforementioned rate and, as a consequence, we
improve the complexity of the accelerated geodesically Riemannian optimization
solution in Mart\'inez-Rubio (2022). We also analyze projected gradient descent
and Frank-Wolfe algorithms in this constrained quasar-convex setting. To the
best of our knowledge, our work provides the first analyses of first-order
methods for quasar-convex smooth functions with general convex constraints.

Abstract: Clinician scheduling remains a persistent challenge due to limited clinical
resources and fluctuating demands. This complexity is especially acute in large
academic anesthesiology departments as physicians balance responsibilities
across multiple clinical sites with conflicting priorities. Further, scheduling
must account for individual clinical and lifestyle preferences to ensure job
satisfaction and well-being. Traditional approaches, often based on statistical
or rule-based optimization models, rely on structured data and explicit domain
knowledge. However, these methods often overlook unstructured information,
e.g., free-text notes from routinely administered clinician well-being surveys
and scheduling platforms. These notes may reveal implicit and underutilized
clinical resources. Neglecting such information can lead to misaligned
schedules, increased burnout, overlooked staffing flexibility, and suboptimal
utilization of available resources. To address this gap, we propose a
predict-then-optimize framework that integrates classification-based clinician
availability predictions with a mixed-integer programming schedule optimization
model. Large language models (LLMs) are employed to extract actionable
preferences and implicit constraints from unstructured schedule notes,
enhancing the reliability of availability predictions. These predictions then
inform the schedule optimization considering four objectives: first, ensuring
clinical full-time equivalent compliance, second, reducing workload imbalances
by enforcing equitable proportions of shift types, third, maximizing clinician
availability for assigned shifts, and fourth, schedule consistency. By
combining the interpretive power of LLMs with the rigor of mathematical
optimization, our framework provides a robust, data-driven solution that
enhances operational efficiency while supporting equity and clinician
well-being.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种时空随机二分匹配问题（ST-RBMP）的建模框架，用于解决共享出行等位置服务中的动态匹配问题，通过优化车辆/客户汇集间隔和最大匹配半径来最小化系统匹配成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有二分匹配问题难以处理空间分布和时间到达的随机性与异质性，而共享出行等位置服务需要动态匹配随机到达的客户和车辆。

Method: 开发了静态同质RBMP下最大匹配半径的期望匹配距离闭式公式，通过连续逼近扩展到空间异质性，将ST-RBMP建模为最优控制问题求解最优汇集间隔和匹配半径。

Conclusion: 该建模框架为移动服务运营商提供了关键管理洞察，能够有效设计动态匹配策略以优化系统性能。

Abstract: This paper explores a variant of bipartite matching problem, referred to as
the Spatiotemporal Random Bipartite Matching Problem (ST-RBMP), that
accommodates randomness and heterogeneity in the spatial distributions and
temporal arrivals of bipartite vertices. This type of problem can be applied to
many location-based services, such as shared mobility systems, where randomly
arriving customers and vehicles must be matched dynamically. This paper
proposes a new modeling framework to address ST-RBMP's challenges associated
with the spatiotemporal heterogeneity, dynamics, and stochastic
decision-making. The objective is to dynamically determine the optimal
vehicle/customer pooling intervals and maximum matching radii that minimize the
system-wide matching costs, including customer and vehicle waiting times and
matching distances. Closed-form formulas for estimating the expected matching
distances under a maximum matching radius are developed for static and
homogeneous RBMPs, and then extended to accommodate spatial heterogeneity via
continuum approximation. The ST-RBMP is then formulated as an optimal control
problem where optimal values of pooling intervals and matching radii are solved
over time and space. A series of experiments with simulated data are conducted
to demonstrate that the proposed formulas for static RBMPs under matching
radius and spatial heterogeneity yield very accurate results on estimating
matching probabilities and distances. Additional numerical results are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ST-RBMP modeling
framework in designing dynamic matching strategies for mobility services under
various demand and supply patterns, which offers key managerial insights for
mobility service operators.

Motivation: 研究梯度方法在非凸优化中的收敛行为，特别是问题表述如何影响收敛性质，旨在理解过参数化对收敛速度的改善作用。

Method: 使用梯度流分析，通过简单示例和连续时间线性二次调节器(LQR)问题，研究过参数化（通过线性前馈神经网络）对收敛行为的影响。

Result: 发现梯度流解可以是指数收敛或渐进收敛，取决于问题表述。在LQR问题中，过参数化使渐进收敛变为几乎全局指数收敛，并推导了明确的收敛速率。

Conclusion: 问题表述对梯度方法的收敛性质有重要影响，过参数化可以显著改善收敛行为，从渐进收敛变为指数收敛，这一现象在一般LQR问题中持续存在。

Abstract: In this work we study the convergence of gradient methods for nonconvex
optimization problems -- specifically the effect of the problem formulation to
the convergence behavior of the solution of a gradient flow. We show through a
simple example that, surprisingly, the gradient flow solution can be
exponentially or asymptotically convergent, depending on how the problem is
formulated. We then deepen the analysis and show that a policy optimization
strategy for the continuous-time linear quadratic regulator (LQR) (which is
known to present only asymptotic convergence globally) presents almost global
exponential convergence if the problem is overparameterized through a linear
feed-forward neural network (LFFNN). We prove this qualitative improvement
always happens for a simplified version of the LQR problem and derive explicit
convergence rates for the gradient flow. Finally, we show that both the
qualitative improvement and the quantitative rate gains persist in the general
LQR through numerical simulations.
