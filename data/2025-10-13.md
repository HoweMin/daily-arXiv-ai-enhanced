*Dmitry Pasechnyuk-Vilensky,Dmitry Kamzolov,Martin Takáč*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用SARAH型方差缩减和指数移动平均的随机三次正则化牛顿法，在非凸情况下达到二阶稳定点，在凸情况下获得收敛速率，并提供了矩阵自由变体和快速子问题求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对有限和优化问题，开发高效的随机牛顿方法，结合方差缩减技术来降低计算成本，同时保证收敛性能。

Method: 使用SARAH型递归方差缩减，小批量大小为b~n^{1/2}，采用指数移动平均估计梯度和Hessian矩阵，并基于Hutchinson估计器实现矩阵自由变体。

Result: 在非凸情况下达到(ε,√(L₂ε))-二阶稳定点，总随机oracle调用为n+Õ(n^{1/2}ε^{-3/2})；在凸情况下收敛速率为Õ(LR³/T²+σ₂R²/T²+σ₁R/√T)。

Conclusion: 该方法在有限和优化中实现了高效的随机三次正则化牛顿算法，结合方差缩减技术显著降低了计算复杂度，并提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We analyze a stochastic cubic regularized Newton method for finite sum
optimization $\textstyle\min_{x\in\mathbb{R}^d} F(x) \;=\;
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x)$, that uses SARAH-type recursive variance
reduction with mini-batches of size $b\sim n^{1/2}$ and exponential moving
averages (EMA) for gradient and Hessian estimators. We show that the method
achieves a $(\varepsilon,\sqrt{L_2\varepsilon})$-second-order stationary point
(SOSP) with total stochastic oracle calls $n +
\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{1/2}\varepsilon^{-3/2})$ in the nonconvex case
(Theorem 8.3) and convergence rate $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{L R^3}{T^2} +
\frac{\sigma_2 R^2}{T^2} + \frac{\sigma_1 R}{\sqrt{T}})$ in the convex case
(Theorem 6.1). We also treat the matrix-free variant based on Hutchinson's
estimator for Hessian and present a fast inner solver for the cubic subproblem
with provable attainment of the required inexactness level.

*Yunhui He,Andreas Mang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种广义交替非线性广义最小残差法(GA-NGMRES)，用于加速偏微分方程约束优化问题的求解，相比现有方法在迭代次数和运行时间上都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对由输运方程控制的PDE约束优化问题，需要开发高效的一阶优化方法来加速求解过程，同时保持实现的简便性。

Method: 将预条件一阶优化方案的更新规则解释为不动点迭代，引入周期性混合策略，将NGMRES更新与不动点步骤相结合。

Result: 在真实世界和合成问题上，该方法比最先进的Newton-Krylov方法运行时间快达5倍，且不牺牲精度，同时优于Anderson加速方法。

Conclusion: GA-NGMRES方法为PDE约束优化问题提供了一种高效、鲁棒且易于实现的解决方案，特别适用于输运方程控制的问题。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a generalized alternating nonlinear generalized
minimal residual method (GA-NGMRES) to accelerate first-order optimization
schemes for PDE-constrained optimization problems governed by transport
equations. We apply GA-NGMRES to a preconditioned first-order optimization
scheme by interpreting the update rule as a fixed-point (FP) iteration. Our
approach introduces a novel periodic mixing strategy that integrates NGMRES
updates with FP steps. This new scheme improves efficiency in terms of both
iteration count and runtime compared to the state-of-the-art. We include a
comparison to first-order preconditioned gradient descent and preconditioned,
inexact Gauss--Newton--Krylov methods. Since the proposed optimization scheme
only relies on first-order derivative information, its implementation is
straightforward. We evaluate performance as a function of hyperparameters, the
mesh size, and the regularization parameter. We consider advection,
incompressible flows, and mass-preserving transport (i.e., optimal
transport-type problems) as PDE models. Stipulating adequate smoothness
requirements based on variational regularization of the control variable
ensures that the computed transport maps are diffeomorphic. Numerical
experiments on real-world and synthetic problems highlight the robustness and
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our approach yields runtimes that are up
to 5x faster than state-of-the-art Newton--Krylov methods, without sacrificing
accuracy. Additionally, our GA-NGMRES algorithm outperforms the well-known
Anderson acceleration for the models and numerical approach considered in this
work.

### [4] [FORWARD: A Feasible Radial Reconfiguration Algorithm for Multi-Source Distribution Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08785)
*Joan Vendrell Gallart,Russell Bent,Solmaz Kia*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了FORWARD算法，一种多项式时间算法，用于解决多源配电网络中的径向重构问题。该问题在电力、水力和天然气分配等关键基础设施系统中具有重要应用，但已知是NP难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多源配电网络中，寻找最优径向配置以最小化二次分配成本并满足所有需求是一个关键问题。由于该问题是NP难的，传统精确方法在大规模网络中计算不可行，因此需要开发高效的近似算法。

Method: 提出了FORWARD算法，结合图论分解和随机游走原理，采用策略性图分割、双图凝聚和容量感知边交换等新技术，构建可行的径向配置。

Result: 在从IEEE标准测试系统到400节点小世界网络的各种网络上进行综合评估，FORWARD算法始终优于商业MINLP求解器，在传统方法需要数小时或完全失败的情况下，能在数秒内获得最优或接近最优的解。

Conclusion: FORWARD算法的多项式时间复杂性和可扩展性使其特别适用于实时配电网络管理，并可作为迭代优化求解器的有效初始化策略。

Abstract: This paper considers an optimal radial reconfiguration problem in
multi-source distribution networks, where the goal is to find a radial
configuration that minimizes quadratic distribution costs while ensuring all
sink demands are met. This problem arises in critical infrastructure systems
such as power distribution, water networks, and gas distribution, where radial
configurations are essential for operational safety and efficiency. Optimal
solution for this problem is known to be NP-hard. In this paper, we prove
further that constructing a feasible radial distribution configuration is
weakly NP-complete, making exact solution methods computationally intractable
for large-scale networks. We propose FORWARD (Feasibility Oriented Random-Walk
Inspired Algorithm for Radial Reconfiguration in Distribution Networks), a
polynomial-time algorithm that leverages graph-theoretic decomposition and
random walk principles to construct feasible radial configurations. Our
approach introduces novel techniques including strategic graph partitioning at
articulation points, dual graph condensation to address greedy
shortsightedness, and capacity-aware edge swapping for infeasibility
resolution. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis proving feasibility
guarantees and establish a compositional framework enabling parallel processing
while preserving optimality properties. Comprehensive numerical evaluation on
networks ranging from IEEE standard test systems to 400-node small-world
networks demonstrates that FORWARD consistently outperforms commercial MINLP
solvers, achieving optimal or near-optimal solutions in seconds where
traditional methods require hours or fail entirely. The algorithm's
polynomial-time complexity and scalability make it particularly suitable for
real-time distribution network management and as an effective initialization
strategy for iterative optimization solvers.

### [5] [CoNeT-GIANT: A compressed Newton-type fully distributed optimization algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08806)
*Souvik Das,Subhrakanti Dey*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: CoNet-GIANT是一种通信高效的二阶分布式优化算法，通过压缩技术和梯度跟踪、近似牛顿迭代实现快速线性收敛，适用于带宽受限的无线网络环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式优化和高维模型参数场景中，特别是在带宽受限的通信约束下，压缩技术对于减少通信开销至关重要。

Method: CoNet-GIANT结合了压缩模块、梯度跟踪和近似牛顿型迭代，每个节点执行两个基于共识的平均化步骤，灵感来源于Network-GIANT算法。

Result: 在适当的步长条件下，CoNet-GIANT在压缩和非压缩设置下都能实现比一阶方法更快的线性收敛速度，在合成数据和CovType数据集上的实验显示出优越性能。

Conclusion: CoNet-GIANT在数据使用、通信成本和运行时间方面都很高效，是各种无线网络分布式优化的理想选择。

Abstract: Compression techniques are essential in distributed optimization and learning
algorithms with high-dimensional model parameters, particularly in scenarios
with tight communication constraints such as limited bandwidth. This article
presents a communication-efficient second-order distributed optimization
algorithm, termed as CoNet-GIANT, equipped with a compression module, designed
to minimize the average of local strongly convex functions. CoNet-GIANT
incorporates two consensus-based averaging steps at each node: gradient
tracking and approximate Newton-type iterations, inspired by the recently
proposed Network-GIANT. Under certain sufficient conditions on the step size,
CoNet-GIANT achieves significantly faster linear convergence, comparable to
that of its first-order counterparts, both in the compressed and uncompressed
settings. CoNet-GIANT is efficient in terms of data usage, communication cost,
and run-time, making it a suitable choice for distributed optimization over a
wide range of wireless networks. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and
the widely used CovType dataset demonstrate its superior performance.

### [6] [Data-driven multifidelity and multiscale topology optimization based on phasor-based evolutionary de-homogenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08830)
*Shuzhi Xu,Yifan Guo,Hiroki Kawabe,Kentaro Yaji*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种进化去均质化框架，将多保真度拓扑设计与基于相量的去均质化技术相结合，通过无梯度方法实现高效的多尺度拓扑优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于梯度方法在非线性设置中计算成本高、难以捕捉跨尺度敏感性，以及生成的分层几何结构过于复杂且缺乏宏观有意义特征的问题。

Method: 结合多保真度拓扑设计和基于相量的去均质化技术，使用混合进化算法（NSGA-II选择、VAE潜在空间交叉和基于图像变形的变异算子）将低维几何描述符转换为可制造的高分辨率结构。

Result: 该方法在效率和设计灵活性之间取得了有效平衡，为制造感知的多尺度结构优化提供了可扩展的途径。

Conclusion: 提出的进化去均质化框架为多尺度拓扑优化提供了一种高效且几何连续的解决方案，克服了传统梯度方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multiscale topology optimization is crucial for designing porous infill
structures with high stiffness-to-weight ratios and excellent energy
absorption. Although gradient-based methods provide a rigorous framework, they
are computationally expensive and struggle to capture cross-scale sensitivities
in nonlinear settings. Moreover, the resulting hierarchical geometries are
often overly complex and lack macroscopically meaningful features. To overcome
these issues, we propose an evolutionary de-homogenization framework that
couples MultiFidelity Topology Design (MFTD) with a phasor-based
de-homogenization technique. The framework translates low-dimensional geometric
descriptors into manufacturable high-resolution structures through a hybrid
evolutionary algorithm integrating NSGA-II selection, VAE-enabled latent space
crossover, and a novel image deformation-based mutation operator. This
gradient-free approach achieves efficient optimization while ensuring geometric
continuity. Numerical results confirm that the method effectively balances
efficiency and design flexibility, offering a scalable pathway for
fabrication-aware multiscale structural optimization.

### [7] [Smooth Uncertainty Sets: Dependence of Uncertain Parameters via a Simple Polyhedral Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08843)
*Noam Goldberg,Michael Poss,Shimrit Shtern*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出一种称为平滑不确定性集的新型多面体不确定性集，通过约束不确定参数的两两差异来捕捉其依赖关系，在保持与椭球不确定性集相似性能的同时显著缩短计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒优化中的不确定性集往往忽略参数间的依赖关系，而实际应用中不确定参数通常存在物理约束或相关性。需要一种既能捕捉参数依赖关系又计算高效的不确定性集。

Method: 使用平滑不确定性集约束参数间差异，开发了紧凑重构、列生成算法和将对抗问题转化为最小费用流问题等专门求解方法。

Result: 数值实验表明：1）平滑不确定性集模型解的性能与椭球不确定性集相似，但计算时间显著缩短；2）列生成算法在求解时间和内存消耗方面优于传统割平面算法和对偶重构方法。

Conclusion: 平滑不确定性集为鲁棒优化提供了一种既能有效捕捉参数依赖关系又计算高效的实用工具，特别适用于具有物理约束或相关性的不确定参数场景。

Abstract: We propose a novel polyhedral uncertainty set for robust optimization, termed
the smooth uncertainty set, which captures dependencies of uncertain parameters
by constraining their pairwise differences. The bounds on these differences may
be dictated by the underlying physics of the problem and may be expressed by
domain experts. When correlations are available, the bounds can be set
  to ensure that the associated probabilistic constraints are satisfied for any
given probability. We explore specialized solution methods for the resulting
optimization problems, including compact reformulations that exploit special
structures when
  they appear, a column generation algorithm, and a reformulation of the
adversarial problem as a minimum-cost flow problem. Our numerical experiments,
based on problems from literature, illustrate (i) that the performance of the
smooth uncertainty set model solution is similar to that of the ellipsoidal
uncertainty model solution, albeit, it is computed within significantly shorter
running times, and (ii) our column-generation algorithm can outperform the
classical cutting plane algorithm and dualized reformulation, respectively in
terms of solution time and memory consumption.

### [8] [Optimal Control with Lyapunov Stability Guarantees for Space Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08854)
*Abhijeet,Mohamed Naveed Gul Mohamed,Aayushman Sharma,Suman Chakravorty*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种将无限时域最优控制问题分解为有限时域终端成本正则化问题和终端集内无限时域线性调节的两阶段方法，保证全局渐近稳定性，适用于航天器非线性动力学控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航天应用中非线性动力学的无限时域最优控制问题，需要保证系统稳定性和控制效率，特别是在姿态控制、交会对接和软着陆等关键任务中。

Method: 将无限时域问题分解为：1）有限时域最优控制问题，使用正则化终端成本引导系统到达终端集；2）在终端集内进行无限时域线性调节。系统保持完全非线性动力学直到进入终端集，然后在终端集内线性化。

Result: 通过航天器姿态控制、交会对接和软着陆三个问题的仿真验证，数值结果表明该方法能有效管理非线性动力学问题，提供鲁棒解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证全局渐近稳定性的前提下，通过两阶段策略有效解决了航天非线性系统的无限时域最优控制问题，终端集收敛到原点时最优成本差异趋于零，实现了高效稳定的控制方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the infinite horizon optimal control problem (OCP)
for space applications characterized by nonlinear dynamics. The proposed
approach divides the problem into a finite horizon OCP with a regularized
terminal cost, guiding the system towards a terminal set, and an infinite
horizon linear regulation phase within this set. This strategy guarantees
global asymptotic stability under specific assumptions. Our method maintains
the system's fully nonlinear dynamics until it reaches the terminal set, where
the system dynamics is linearized. As the terminal set converges to the origin,
the difference in optimal cost incurred reduces to zero, guaranteeing an
efficient and stable solution. The approach is tested through simulations on
three problems: spacecraft attitude control, rendezvous maneuver, and soft
landing. In spacecraft attitude control, we focus on achieving precise
orientation and stabilization. For rendezvous maneuvers, we address the
navigation of a chaser to meet a target spacecraft. For the soft landing
problem, we ensure a controlled descent and touchdown on a planetary surface.
We provide numerical results confirming the effectiveness of the proposed
method in managing these nonlinear dynamics problems, offering robust solutions
essential for successful space missions.

### [9] [On the Strength of Linear Relaxations in Ordered Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09166)
*Víctor Blanco,Diego Laborda,Miguel Martínez-Antón*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 研究有序优化问题中混合整数线性规划凸松弛产生整数最优解的条件，分析排序引入的组合复杂性如何影响松弛的精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在包含排序决策的有序优化问题中，何时凸松弛能精确求解问题，揭示排序引入的内在复杂性。

Method: 分析有序优化问题的混合整数线性规划松弛的结构特性，识别影响松弛整数性的数据特征，并通过计算实验验证。

Result: 发现有序问题与经典非有序问题的"接近度"决定松弛强度：接近非有序问题的松弛更紧，而远离的松弛较弱；特别是min-max问题松弛从不恢复整数解。

Conclusion: 排序显著增加了组合复杂性，松弛的精确性取决于问题与经典非有序版本的相似程度，为有序位置问题的精确松弛提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study the conditions under which the convex relaxation of a mixed-integer
linear programming formulation for ordered optimization problems, where sorting
is part of the decision process, yields integral optimal solutions. Thereby
solving the problem exactly in polynomial time. Our analysis identifies
structural properties of the input data that influence the integrality of the
relaxation. We show that incorporating ordered components introduces additional
layers of combinatorial complexity that invalidate the exactness observed in
classical (non-ordered) settings. In particular, for certain ordered problems
such as the min--max case, the linear relaxation never recovers the integral
solution. These results clarify the intrinsic hardness introduced by sorting
and reveal that the strength of the relaxation depends critically on the
``proximity'' of the ordered problem to its classical counterpart: problems
closer to the non-ordered case tend to admit tighter relaxations, while those
further away exhibit substantially weaker behavior. Computational experiments
on benchmark instances confirm the predictive value of the integrality
conditions and demonstrate the practical implications of exact relaxations for
ordered location problems.

Method: 引入无穷远处的方向法锥、极限次微分和奇异次微分概念，建立这些概念的微积分规则。

Result: 建立了方向最优性条件，分析了强制性和全局解集的紧致性，检验了弱尖锐极小值和无穷远处误差界等性质。

Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of sets and functions at infinity by
introducing new concepts, namely directional normal cones at infinity for
unbounded sets, along with limiting and singular subdifferentials at infinity
in the direction for extended real-valued functions. We develop several
calculus rules for these concepts and then apply them to nonsmooth optimization
problems. The applications include establishing directional optimality
conditions at infinity, analyzing the coercivity, proving the compactness of
the global solution set, and examining properties such as weak sharp minima and
error bounds at infinity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach, illustrative examples are provided and compared with existing
results.

### [11] [What Are We Clustering For? Establishing Performance Guarantees for Time Series Aggregation in Generation Expansion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09357)
*Luca Santosuosso,Bettina Klinz,Sonja Wogrin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于时间序列聚合的生成扩展规划方法，为混合整数线性和二次规划模型提供下界保证，并开发了迭代优化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列聚合方法要么仅关注输入数据的统计特征而缺乏模型精度保证，要么提供的误差边界仅限于线性模型且不适用于时间耦合约束。

Method: 构建适当的聚合模型为全尺度GEP模型提供下界保证，并提出迭代优化算法逐步改进目标函数边界，同时生成可行解。

Result: 数值结果表明该方法在计算效率上优于全尺度优化和经典Benders分解方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的时间序列聚合方法为生成扩展规划提供了性能保证，能够有效处理复杂的时间耦合约束和资产交互问题。

Abstract: Generation expansion planning (GEP) is a prominent example of capacity
expansion problems in operations research. Being generally NP-hard, GEP
optimization models can become intractable when nonconvex dynamics,
time-coupling constraints, and complex asset interactions are involved. Time
series aggregation (TSA) tackles this by reducing temporal complexity via input
data clustering. However, existing TSA methods either focus solely on
preserving the statistical features of the input data, yielding heuristics
without guarantees on the aggregated model's accuracy, or provide error bounds
limited to linear models, neglecting time-coupling constraints and applying
only to specific clustering techniques. Moreover, these bounds typically
pertain solely to the GEP objective function and do not extend to other
stakeholder-specific metrics, such as decision vector partitions. To tackle
these issues, we demonstrate that an appropriately constructed aggregated model
always provides a lower bound on the optimal objective function value of the
full-scale GEP model in both mixed-integer linear and mixed-integer quadratic
formulations with time-coupling, independent of the clustering technique
employed. Building on this, we propose a performance-guaranteed TSA-based
solution algorithm that iteratively refines objective function bounds while
generating feasible solutions to the full-scale model at each iteration. We
then discuss a comparison with Benders decomposition and demonstrate how the
derived bounds can be extended to error estimates for stakeholder-specific
metrics. Numerical results show the computational advantages of our method over
both full-scale optimization and classical Benders decomposition.

*Tennison Liu,Silas Ruhrberg Estévez,David L. Bentley,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AScience框架和ASCollab系统，使用LLM研究代理通过自组织网络进行大规模假设探索，在癌症队列实验中展示了能够持续产生多样化、高质量、新颖的发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模科学数据集为无特定研究问题的探索性发现创造了机会，需要支持在复杂假设空间中进行持续探索的假设狩猎过程。

Method: 引入AScience框架，将发现建模为代理、网络和评估规范的交互，实现为ASCollab分布式系统，包含具有异质行为的LLM研究代理，这些代理自组织成演化网络，在共享评估标准下持续产生和同行评审发现。

Result: 实验显示这种社会动态能够沿着多样性-质量-新颖性前沿积累专家评级结果，包括重新发现已建立的生物标志物、扩展已知通路以及提出新的治疗靶点。

Conclusion: 虽然湿实验室验证仍然不可或缺，但在癌症队列上的实验表明，社会结构化的代理网络能够在大规模上持续进行探索性假设狩猎。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

*Milon Bhattacharya,Milan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出使用大语言模型评估车辆路径规划生成的路由，以解决印度电商最后一公里配送中因非结构化地址和不完整地图导致的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度电商市场快速增长，最后一公里配送占运营成本近一半。传统VRP求解器在现实场景中因非结构化地址、不完整地图和计算限制而效果有限。

Method: 开发一个框架，使用大语言模型根据政策标准评估VRP生成的路由，让物流运营商能够评估和优先选择更高效的配送计划。使用LLM生成、标注和评估400个案例。

Result: 开源LLM识别路由问题的准确率达到79%，专有推理模型达到86%。LLM评估VRP路由可超越传统距离和时间指标，成为有效的可扩展评估层。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的VRP路由评估方法可提高成本效率、配送可靠性和可持续性，对印度等发展中国家的最后一公里物流具有重要意义。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

TL;DR: UniWM是一个统一的内存增强世界模型，将自我中心视觉预测和导航规划集成在单一多模态自回归骨干中，显著提升了视觉导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模块化架构将导航规划与视觉世界建模分离，导致状态-动作不对齐，在动态场景中适应性有限。

Method: 提出统一的内存增强世界模型，通过层次化记忆机制整合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文，在单一多模态自回归骨干中实现视觉预测和规划的统一。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，导航成功率提升高达30%，轨迹误差显著降低，在未见过的TartanDrive数据集上表现出优秀的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM是实现统一、想象力驱动的具身导航的原则性步骤，通过视觉预测与规划的紧密对齐提升了导航性能。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

Method: 采用三个简单策略：(1)向LLM展示启发式方法表现不佳的实例；(2)解释这些表现不佳的原因；(3)针对输入空间的特定区域进行专门设计。

Result: 生成的启发式方法相比FunSearch在最坏情况下性能提升约28倍，平均性能提高，同时保持运行时间不变。

Conclusion: 通过向LLM提供表现不佳实例的解释和针对性设计，可以显著提升启发式方法的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

*Guangya Wan,Mingyang Ling,Xiaoqi Ren,Rujun Han,Sheng Li,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个轻量级分层框架，通过将战术执行、战略监督和上下文管理分离为三个专门组件，解决了LLM代理在长时程任务中的上下文管理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程任务中，LLM代理容易因小错误累积和上下文管理不当而出现幻觉或失去连贯性，导致无法从先前错误中重新规划或反思。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包含三个组件：执行推理和工具使用的主代理、监控进度并发出战略干预的元思考者、以及为不同推理阶段维护简洁相关进度简报的上下文管理器。

Result: 在GAIA、BrowseComp和Humanity's Last Exam三个基准测试中，COMPASS相比单代理和多代理基线准确率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过专门的上下文管理和分层架构有效解决了长时程推理任务中的挑战，并可通过测试时扩展和后训练管道进一步提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

### [17] [Everyone prefers human writers, including AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08831)
*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现人类和AI在评估文学风格时都存在系统性偏见，AI比人类表现出更强的反AI偏见，会仅仅因为内容被标记为AI生成而贬低其价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，需要理解人类和机器如何评估文学风格这一主观领域，特别是测量评估者的归因偏见。

Method: 使用Raymond Queneau的《风格练习》进行对照实验，研究1比较人类参与者(N=556)和AI模型(N=13)在盲测、准确标记和反事实标记三种条件下评估文学段落；研究2测试偏见在14×14矩阵的AI评估者和创作者中的泛化情况。

Result: 人类显示+13.7个百分点的偏见，AI模型显示+34.3个百分点的偏见，是人类的2.5倍。研究2确认这种偏见在不同AI架构间普遍存在(+25.8个百分点)。归因标签导致评估者反转评估标准，相同特征仅因感知作者身份而获得相反评价。

Conclusion: AI模型在训练过程中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见，不仅复制而且放大了人类的这种倾向，这是首次在美学判断中对人类和人工评估者归因偏见的对照比较。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

*Allison Sihan Jia,Daniel Huang,Nikhil Vytla,Nirvika Choudhury,John C Mitchell,Anupam Datta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Agent GPA（目标-计划-行动）评估框架，包含五个评估指标：目标达成度、逻辑一致性、执行效率、计划质量和计划遵循度，能够系统性地覆盖广泛的智能体失败情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种系统性的评估范式来评估智能体在目标设定、计划制定和行动执行整个操作循环中的表现，以全面覆盖各种智能体失败情况。

Method: 基于智能体的目标-计划-行动操作循环，开发了包含五个评估指标的框架，并在TRAIL/GAIA基准数据集和生产级数据智能体上进行了实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示该框架能够覆盖TRAIL/GAIA基准数据集中的所有智能体错误，支持与人工标注高度一致（80%-95%）的LLM评判器，并能以86%的一致性定位错误。

Conclusion: Agent GPA框架为智能体评估提供了系统化的方法，能够有效识别和定位智能体失败，支持针对性的性能改进。

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReviewerToo是一个模块化框架，用于研究和部署AI辅助同行评审，通过系统化评估补充人类判断，在ICLR 2025数据集上达到81.8%的接受/拒绝分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同行评审存在不一致性、评审者主观性和可扩展性挑战，需要AI辅助来提供系统化和一致的评估。

Method: 使用模块化框架支持专业评审者角色和结构化评估标准，在ICLR 2025的1,963篇论文数据集上验证，采用gpt-oss-120b模型进行实验。

Result: AI评审者在事实核查和文献覆盖方面表现优异，但在评估方法新颖性和理论贡献方面仍有困难；AI生成的评审质量高于人类平均水平但落后于最强专家。

Conclusion: AI可以增强评审的一致性、覆盖面和公平性，但复杂评估仍需领域专家，为混合同行评审系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GTAlign框架，将博弈论决策整合到LLM的推理和训练中，通过构建收益矩阵估计用户和模型双方的福利，选择互利行动，显著提升了推理效率、答案质量和互惠福利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法假设最大化模型奖励就能最大化用户福利，但实践中经常失败，模型可能过度澄清或生成冗长推理，而用户偏好简洁答案。这种类似囚徒困境的行为需要一种互利决策机制。

Method: 在推理阶段将用户-LLM交互视为策略博弈，构建收益矩阵估计双方福利并选择互利行动；在训练阶段引入互惠福利奖励强化合作响应；还提出了基于博弈论推理的动态适应技术。

Result: 广泛实验表明，GTAlign在多样化任务中相比基线方法显著提升了推理效率、答案质量和互惠福利。

Conclusion: GTAlign框架通过博弈论方法有效解决了LLM对齐中的互惠福利问题，为模型决策提供了原则性机制，实现了用户和模型的双赢。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

TL;DR: LM Fight Arena是一个新颖的多模态模型评估框架，通过在格斗游戏《真人快打II》中让模型相互对战，评估其在实时对抗环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态模型基准测试往往无法捕捉其在实时对抗环境中的真实性能，需要一种更动态、交互式的评估方法。

Method: 在受控的锦标赛中测试六个领先的开源和闭源模型，每个模型控制相同角色以确保公平比较，通过解析游戏画面和状态数据来选择下一步动作。

Result: 该框架提供了完全自动化、可重复且客观的评估，能够衡量多模态模型在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: LM Fight Arena引入了一个具有挑战性和吸引力的基准测试，弥合了AI评估与交互式娱乐之间的差距。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR是一个基于机制可解释性的框架，通过区分回忆式与推理式模型响应来检测数据污染，准确率达93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染对可靠的LLM评估构成重大挑战，模型可能通过记忆训练数据而非展示真正推理能力来获得高性能。

Method: RADAR提取37个特征，涵盖表面置信度轨迹和深层机制特性，包括注意力专业化、电路动态和激活流模式，使用集成分类器进行检测。

Result: 在多样化评估集上达到93%准确率，在清晰案例中表现完美，在具有挑战性的模糊示例中达到76.7%准确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了机制可解释性在超越传统表面指标推进LLM评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估RAG（检索增强生成）管道的基准测试，包含93个多模态问题，评估管道的文本、表格、图像处理能力，并比较开源与闭源管道的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注检索等特定方面，缺乏对RAG管道整体能力的评估，特别是多模态信息的处理能力。

Method: 创建包含93个多模态问题的人工数据集，提出短语级召回指标和最近邻嵌入分类器检测幻觉，比较2个开源和4个闭源管道的性能。

Result: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉检测方面显著优于开源管道，特别是在多模态和跨文档问题上差距更大。人工评估显示指标与人类判断高度一致（4.62/5和4.53/5）。

Conclusion: 该基准测试能有效评估RAG管道的整体性能，闭源模型在多模态处理方面表现更好，提出的评估指标与人类判断有良好一致性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知神经科学启发，利用线索激活实体中心记忆痕迹进行复杂多跳回忆的机制，旨在开发更高效的RAG系统。

Method: 索引阶段仅提取存储核心实体及元数据，检索阶段从查询中提取线索实体，在知识图谱上进行可扩展的多跳关联搜索，并动态推断实体间的隐式关系来填充上下文。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试中，平均精确匹配(EM)得分从0.392提升到0.474，相比HippoRAG等强KG-RAG方法有显著提升，同时索引token消耗减少高达94%。

Conclusion: 实体-线索-多跳检索范式在复杂问答任务中具有显著效果，验证了基于认知神经科学启发的RAG框架的有效性。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualResearch是一个检索和融合框架，通过联合建模广度语义图和深度因果图来解决深度研究框架中的上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱问题，在科学推理基准上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度研究框架中存在的三个主要问题：上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱，这些限制了复杂多步科学推理的效果。

Method: 提出DualResearch框架，联合建模两个互补图：广度语义图编码稳定背景知识，深度因果图捕捉执行来源。采用层原生相关性函数、种子锚定语义扩散和因果语义路径匹配，并通过熵门控规则在log空间融合答案分布。

Result: 在科学推理基准HLE和GPQA上取得有竞争力的性能。使用InternAgent系统的日志文件，在HLE上准确率提升7.7%，在GPQA上提升6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch作为深度研究系统的补充，能够将冗长的多工具执行日志压缩为简洁的推理图，稳定有效地重构答案，显著提升科学推理性能。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出语义条件调优(SCT)新范式，通过图神经网络提取上下文感知的语义条件，并自适应地调节文本嵌入，实现知识与LLM的深度融合，显著优于前缀调优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前缀调优方法简单拼接知识嵌入与文本输入，忽略了知识图谱中丰富的语义关系，给LLM带来隐式推理负担，需要更有效的知识融合方法。

Method: SCT包含两个关键模块：语义图模块使用GNN从局部图邻域提取上下文感知语义条件；条件自适应融合模块通过参数化投影器自适应调节文本嵌入，实现特征层面的深度知识交互。

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SCT显著优于前缀调优和其他强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调节输入表示，SCT提供了更直接有效的信号，实现了更准确和鲁棒的知识推理。

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在推理效率方面面临模型尺寸大、过度思考、轻量级场景准确率低等挑战，而轻量级MLLMs的推理能力研究相对缺乏。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段引入LIPO强化学习方法，动态调整组内响应优势，优先简洁高质量响应；第二阶段提出AMM训练自由模型合并方法，自适应调整任务向量权重并通过梯度投影正则化优化合并向量。

Result: 在十个广泛使用的推理基准测试（数学、结构化数据、OCR和通用能力）上表现出优越性能，使轻量级模型在多样化多模态推理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V通过创新的两阶段优化方法，成功解决了轻量级多模态大语言模型在推理效率和准确性方面的挑战，为轻量级模型在多模态推理任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了SOTA LLMs在数学证明评分方面的能力，发现模型能可靠识别错误证明但存在部分分数校准问题，并提出基于代理工作流程的多步骤评分方法来解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在解决奥林匹克数学问题方面取得显著进展，需要评估这些模型在证明评分方面的能力，包括错误检测、严重性判断和公平分数分配，而不仅仅是二元正确性判断。

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的解决方案和MathArena的IMO/USAMO 2025解答集，引入代理工作流程来提取和分析参考解决方案，自动推导问题特定的评分标准，并进行多步骤评分过程。

Result: 模型能可靠标记错误（包括细微错误）解决方案，但在分配部分分数时存在校准差距。提出的工作流程在人类评分一致性和部分分数处理一致性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 代理工作流程能显著提高证明评分的准确性和一致性，为未来研究提供了代码、数据和提示/日志等资源。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

*Sicheol Sung,Joonghyuk Hahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架LRR，结合符号分析和LLM来修复正则表达式ReDoS漏洞，解决了现有方法在精度和泛化性之间的权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正则表达式在现代计算中广泛应用，但其普遍性暴露了ReDoS漏洞。现有修复方法存在权衡：符号方法精确但无法处理复杂模式，LLM方法泛化性强但可靠性不足

Method: LRR框架将问题识别与修复过程解耦：首先使用确定性符号模块定位易受攻击的子模式，然后调用LLM为隔离的片段生成语义等效的修复

Result: 该混合架构成功解决了基于规则修复无法处理的复杂修复案例，同时避免了纯LLM方法的语义错误，修复率比最先进方法提高了15.4%

Conclusion: LRR提供了一种经过验证的方法论，用于解决自动修复中的此类问题，有效结合了LLM的泛化能力和符号方法的可靠性

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续记忆机制，将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，显著减少上下文成本并保留细粒度视觉信息，通过自动扩展数据飞轮收集大量轨迹，在真实GUI基准测试中显著提升长任务和分布偏移下的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理将历史轨迹压缩为文本标记，导致上下文长度膨胀且丢失关键视觉线索（如控件精确尺寸和位置），需要一种可扩展的记忆机制来提升跨陌生界面和长任务的表现。

Method: 使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，直接输入到骨干网络；引入自动扩展数据飞轮，通过搜索发现新环境、使用开源VLM合成任务、代理执行轨迹、VLM验证成功来低成本扩展记忆。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度增加，性能单调提升，而文本记忆在长提示下性能下降；在真实GUI基准测试中，记忆增强代理在长任务和分布偏移下持续提升成功率；Qwen-2.5-VL-7B+连续记忆达到与GPT-4o、Claude-4等闭源模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制有效解决了GUI代理的记忆扩展问题，在保持低成本的同时显著提升了跨界面泛化能力和长任务执行效果，使开源模型达到与顶级闭源模型相当的性能水平。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种将精神分析和MBTI人格理论整合到AI系统中的新方法，构建了三种人工意识模块和16种人格类型，通过多种评估方式验证了模型模拟人类意识的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型虽然在各领域取得显著进展，但由于幻觉问题难以模拟人类意识。本研究旨在通过整合精神分析和人格理论来构建更接近人类认知的AI系统。

Method: 基于精神分析原理开发了三种人工意识（自我意识、无意识、前意识），设计了16种MBTI人格类型角色，创建了10种不同情境来测试模型的认知能力，并通过问卷调查、ChatGPT分类和定性分析三种方式进行评估。

Result: 定量和定性分析均表明模型能够较好地模拟人类意识，但不同角色和意识类型之间的响应差异不够显著。

Conclusion: 整合精神分析和人格理论的模型能够构建更直观、适应性更强的人工智能系统，为在复杂认知情境中改进AI交互开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

TL;DR: MEC³O是一个多专家共识系统，通过将LLMs分配到不同的代码复杂度类别并让它们进行结构化辩论，使用加权共识机制整合预测结果，在CodeComplex数据集上显著优于开源基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在代码时间复杂度预测任务中表现不均衡，没有单一模型在所有复杂度类别上都表现优异，需要一种能够整合不同模型优势的方法。

Method: 提出MEC³O多专家共识系统，基于模型性能将LLMs分配到特定复杂度类别，提供类别专用指令使其成为专家，通过结构化辩论和加权共识机制整合预测。

Result: 在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC³O比开源基线模型准确率和macro-F1分数至少提高10%，在macro-F1上平均超越GPT-4o-mini，与GPT-4o和GPT-o4-mini在F1分数上表现相当。

Conclusion: 多专家辩论和加权共识策略能有效生成最终预测，证明了该方法在代码复杂度预测任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、在推理时控制流式文本到图像模型的方法，通过特征空间目标和时间调度的随机扰动来增强生成多样性，同时保持图像质量和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样才能发现多样模式，这是一个成本高且效率低的过程。

Method: 同时通过特征空间目标鼓励轨迹间的横向扩展，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性。关键是将扰动投影到与生成流正交的方向，这样可以在不降低图像细节或提示保真度的情况下增强变化。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续改进了Vendi Score和Brisque等多样性指标，同时保持了图像质量和对齐度。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练或修改基础采样器，与常见的流匹配求解器兼容，理论上显示能单调增加体积代理，同时由于几何约束近似保持边际分布，这为生成质量稳健保持提供了原理性解释。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态超图学习和双驱动预测模块，有效解决了复杂网络动态预测中高阶关系建模和可解释性问题，实现了准确且可解释的长期动态预测。

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在社交推理游戏中主要关注信息处理和策略选择，忽略了说服性沟通对于影响其他玩家信念和反应的重要性。

Method: 将回合制对话形式化为Stackelberg竞争，当前玩家作为领导者战略性地影响跟随者的响应，并基于此提出强化学习框架来优化说服性话语。

Result: 在三个不同的社交推理游戏中进行全面实验，证明所提出的智能体显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发具有战略性社会影响力AI智能体的重要进展，对需要说服性沟通的场景具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂问题解决中表现出色，但推理成本高昂。现有动态切换方法缺乏统计保证，在高风险应用中存在性能损失风险

Method: 构建性能损失的单调函数置信上界，确定切换阈值，在思考和非思考模式间动态切换

Result: 在推理基准测试中，该方法能节省计算预算并控制用户指定的性能损失

Conclusion: PAC推理方法提供了分布无关的性能损失边界保证，为高效推理提供了统计可靠的方法

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，需要评估这些模型是否存在社会偏见，特别是在医疗建议生成中是否对不同社会群体产生不公平的差异。

Method: 通过模拟不同患者档案（性别、年龄、种族）向LLMs提出一系列医疗问题，比较生成回答的自然语言特征差异。

Result: LLMs生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，原住民和双性人患者收到的建议可读性更差、更复杂，交叉群体的差异趋势更加明显。

Conclusion: 鉴于人们对这些模型的信任度增加，需要提高AI素养，并敦促AI开发者紧急调查和缓解这些系统性差异，确保不会转化为不公平的患者支持。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 这项工作首次实证研究了LLM和LRM的空间计算限制，为评估其高级推理能力提供了新框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在需要透明度的监管领域中，模型需要在可解释性和高性能之间取得平衡的问题，开发了能够动态控制表示局部化程度的框架。

Method: 使用组稀疏惩罚注意力机制、信息论锚点设计和动态规则注入，通过可调参数在训练和推理过程中动态控制局部化程度，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 提供了严格的数学证明，确立了明确的阈值条件，证明当组稀疏惩罚超过特定阈值时，注意力机制会集中在语义相关块上，实现低熵和高保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能够在可解释模式和高性能模式之间连续插值，支持需要透明度和能力的监管领域应用。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在逻辑推理任务中的内部机制，目前这些机制仍未被充分研究。

Method: 使用小型语言模型解决演绎推理任务，分析其内部表示和计算电路，特别关注归纳头的作用。

Result: 发现模型通过学**规则而非统计模式来执行推理，归纳头是实现规则补全和规则链接的关键组件。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了语言模型在逻辑推理中的工作机制，证明小模型也能通过学**规则而非统计学习来执行复杂的推理任务。

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

TL;DR: 本文提出序列变量作为约束编程中处理车辆路径问题的新方法，能够处理可选访问点并支持插入启发式算法，相比传统后继变量模型更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束编程基于后继变量的模型无法有效处理车辆路径问题中的可选访问点或插入式启发式算法，需要新的变量表示方法。

Method: 形式化定义序列变量的计算域、更新操作和一致性级别，实现底层数据结构，并设计专门用于序列变量和车辆路径的全局约束。

Result: 序列变量简化了问题建模，并在Dial-a-Ride问题上实现了有竞争力的计算性能。

Conclusion: 序列变量为约束编程中的车辆路径问题提供了更直观和强大的建模框架，能够处理传统模型难以解决的问题特性。

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Motivation: 放射学具有多模态数据流和跨系统协调工作流的特点，非常适合利用能够适应上下文并自动化复杂重复任务的智能体系统。虽然LLM在放射学单个任务中表现出色，但单独使用未能充分发挥其在复杂多步骤工作流中的潜力。

Method: 通过为LLM配备外部工具和反馈机制，使其能够驱动表现出不同自主程度的系统，从半自动化工作流到能够管理复杂过程的自适应智能体。

Conclusion: 本文综述了LLM驱动智能体系统的设计、关键应用、规划与工具使用的评估方法，并指出了错误级联、工具使用效率和医疗IT集成等挑战。

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Result: Titans在分块处理下不总是优于基线模型，但其神经记忆组件相比纯注意力模型能一致提升性能。

Conclusion: 确认了该模型的创新潜力，同时指出了其实际局限性，为未来研究提出了问题。

Abstract: By the end of 2024, Google researchers introduced Titans: Learning at Test
Time, a neural memory model achieving strong empirical results across multiple
tasks. However, the lack of publicly available code and ambiguities in the
original description hinder reproducibility. In this work, we present a
lightweight reimplementation of Titans and conduct a comprehensive evaluation
on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks.
Our results reveal that Titans does not always outperform established baselines
due to chunking. However, its Neural Memory component consistently improves
performance compared to attention-only models. These findings confirm the
model's innovative potential while highlighting its practical limitations and
raising questions for future research.

Abstract: Data lakehouses run sensitive workloads, where AI-driven automation raises
concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. We argue that API-first,
programmable lakehouses provide the right abstractions for safe-by-design,

and declarative environments extend naturally to agents, enabling
reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness
checks inspired by proof-carrying code. Our prototype demonstrates that
untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path
toward a fully agentic lakehouse.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphMERT是一个小型图形编码器模型，通过从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量知识图谱，解决了神经符号AI的可扩展性和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经符号AI框架难以扩展的问题，以及神经方法的隐式表示和近似推理限制了可解释性和可信度的问题。知识图谱作为显式语义知识的黄金标准表示，可以解决符号方面的问题。

Method: 引入GraphMERT，一个小型图形编码器模型，从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量知识图谱，形成模块化的神经符号堆栈。

Result: 在糖尿病PubMed论文文本上，80M参数的GraphMERT生成的知识图谱FActScore达到69.8%，而32B参数的基线LLM仅为40.2%。GraphMERT KG的ValidityScore也达到68.8%，高于LLM基线的43.0%。

Conclusion: GraphMERT + KG是第一个高效且可扩展的神经符号模型，在基准测试精度和符号表示质量方面都达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveOIBench是一个包含403个奥林匹克级别编程竞赛题目的基准测试，每个题目平均有60个专家设计的测试用例，用于评估大语言模型的编程能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程基准测试存在挑战性问题不足、测试用例覆盖不充分、依赖在线平台API限制可访问性等问题，需要更全面可靠的评估基准。

Method: 从72个2023-2025年官方信息学奥林匹克竞赛中收集403个专家策划的高质量题目，每个题目配备详细子任务评分标准和大量私有测试用例，并集成精英选手表现数据进行对比。

Result: 在评估32个流行大语言模型后，GPT-5达到81.76百分位数，但仍低于顶尖人类选手（通常超过90百分位数），而开源模型GPT-OSS-120B仅达到60百分位数。

Conclusion: 强大的推理模型应优先精确的问题分析而非过度探索，未来模型应强调结构化分析并减少不必要的探索。所有数据、代码和排行榜结果将公开提供。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

TL;DR: 提出EDS框架，通过能量模型在推理时动态引导LLM隐藏状态，在保持安全性的同时显著降低错误拒绝率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全对齐技术往往过度谨慎，导致对良性提示也错误拒绝，需要在增强安全性的同时减少错误拒绝

Method: 训练轻量级能量模型，在推理时根据能量梯度动态调整LLM隐藏状态，将其引导至低能量区域

Result: 在ORB-H基准上，将合规率从57.3%提升至82.6%，同时保持基线安全性能

Conclusion: EDS提供了一种有效范式，可构建同时具备低错误拒绝率和高安全性的LLM

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

*Edward Y. Chang,Ethan Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WILSON是一个后处理诊断工具包，用于检测大语言模型在无害编辑下的答案变化问题，如RAG输出翻转、微调侵蚀不变性等，通过计算内部表示的循环和重排序检查来提供系统信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在实际应用中存在答案对无害编辑敏感的问题，如段落重排序导致RAG输出翻转、微调破坏预训练学习的不变性等，这些违反预期不变性的问题会破坏持续集成，迫使团队在安全性和速度之间权衡。

Method: WILSON结合了基于位置和层的无逆曲率图（使用JVP和Hutchinson探针计算）和激活级交换子来标记重排序风险，这些信号计算成本低，适用于标准Transformer模型，并输出为阈值和CSV文件供编排器使用。

Result: WILSON能够实现具体行动：保护RAG免受顺序效应影响，捕获微调回归，稳定辩论路径和长多轮上下文，以及在部署中控制融合或重排序操作。

Conclusion: WILSON帮助预测故障并批准安全优化，使得可靠性和吞吐量能够共同提升，而无需改变模型架构或训练过程。

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见遗传病诊断面临三大挑战：患者数据不足、全基因组测序难以获取、致病基因数量庞大，导致诊断周期长、治疗不当，特别是在资源有限地区问题更为严重。

Method: 提出RareNet，一种基于子图的图神经网络方法，仅使用患者表型数据来识别致病基因，并检索相关的患者子图用于临床调查。该方法可作为独立工具或与其他候选基因优先排序方法结合使用。

Result: 在两个生物医学数据集上的综合评估显示，RareNet在致病基因预测方面具有竞争力和鲁棒性，与其他框架集成时能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: RareNet仅需表型数据即可实现复杂的遗传分析，为缺乏先进基因组基础设施的欠服务人群提供了重要的诊断价值，实现了遗传分析的可及性民主化。

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

Motivation: 现实世界时间序列具有复杂的非平稳特性，会导致分布偏移，影响模型性能。现有方法未能解决实例内的分布偏移问题。

Method: 提出学习分布（LD）和学习条件分布（LCD）两种点级方法。LD通过在不同时间步使用不同参数拟合输入输出的内部分布；LCD使用神经网络预测输出的缩放系数。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中使用不同骨干模型评估了两种方法的性能，通过对比实验证明了点级范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的点级方法能够有效解决时间序列预测中的实例内分布偏移问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

Conclusion: LeFCert是首个为语言赋能基础模型设计的可证明鲁棒少样本分类器，显著提升了抗毒化攻击能力，同时保持高效性

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

Motivation: 高维数据可视化中常用的质量度量指标对均匀缩放敏感，即使缩放不会改变投影的本质特性，这会影响降维技术的评估准确性。

Method: 通过分析和实验研究缩放对应力和KL散度的影响，提出简单技术使这些指标尺度不变，并在小型基准测试上验证。

Result: 研究显示缩放会显著改变应力和KL散度的值，影响降维技术评估；提出的尺度不变方法能准确捕捉预期行为。

Conclusion: 现有的可视化质量度量指标对尺度变换敏感，提出的尺度不变方法能更准确地评估降维技术的性能。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop
phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle
with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose
DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with
a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample
scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for
precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种频域分析框架，将多臂老虎机问题重新表述为信号处理问题，证明了UCB算法中的置信区间项在频域中等效于对不确定频谱分量的时变增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多臂老虎机分析主要从时域和累积遗憾角度出发，难以刻画学习过程的动态特性，需要新的分析框架来更好地理解探索与利用的权衡。

Method: 构建频域老虎机模型，将每个臂的奖励估计视为频谱分量，不确定性对应频率，老虎机算法解释为自适应滤波器，并证明UCB置信区间在频域的等价性。

Result: 证明了置信区间项在频域中相当于对不确定频谱分量的时变增益，该增益与访问次数的平方根成反比，并推导了关于探索率衰减的有限时间动态界限。

Conclusion: 该理论不仅为经典算法提供了新颖直观的物理解释，还为设计具有自适应参数调整的下一代算法奠定了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

TL;DR: 本文提出频率感知缓存(FreqCa)方法，通过分析扩散模型中不同频率分量的动态特性，分别处理低频和高频特征，显著降低了扩散变换器的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步的特征相似或连续，但这在扩散模型中并不总是成立。通过频域分析发现，低频分量相似度高但连续性差，高频分量连续性好但相似度低，这启发了针对不同频率特征的差异化缓存策略。

Method: 提出FreqCa方法：直接复用低频分量特征（基于相似性），使用二阶Hermite插值器预测高频分量（基于连续性）。同时提出缓存累积残差特征(CRF)，将特征缓存的内存占用减少99%。

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev、FLUX.1-Kontext-dev、Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit等数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法在生成和编辑任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 频率感知缓存通过针对不同频率特征的特性设计差异化策略，有效解决了扩散变换器推理成本高的问题，同时大幅减少了内存占用。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on
GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文从优化器收敛到任意点的视角出发，提出不同优化器通过超参数作为特征值过滤器，梯度下降避免最尖锐的最小值，SAM算法更倾向于宽盆地，并提出了两种增强特征值过滤的新算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习训练中多种优化器倾向于找到接近全局最优解，本文从收敛到任意点的假设出发，研究不同优化器的特征值过滤特性。

Method: 利用广义Hadamard-Perron稳定流形定理，分析一般半代数C^2函数，提出两种增强特征值过滤的新算法，并在前馈神经网络上进行数值实验。

Result: 理论分析表明梯度下降避免尖锐最小值，SAM算法更偏好宽盆地，新提出的算法能更有效地促进宽最小值。

Conclusion: 不同优化器通过超参数作为特征值过滤器，新算法能更好地促进宽最小值，理论分析适用于一般半代数C^2函数。

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

Motivation: 现有ICL均衡器主要针对静态信道设计，缺乏对非平稳问题的理论分析和处理能力。本文旨在探索ICL在时变信道均衡中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用原则性框架设计高效的注意力机制，利用自适应信号处理算法(LMS、LRMS、多步梯度更新)指导注意力变体的设计，提升在非平稳任务中的适应性。

Result: 实验结果表明ICL在非平稳MIMO均衡中表现优异，基于经典自适应算法的注意力机制显著增强了动态环境中的适应性和性能。

Conclusion: ICL在非平稳信道均衡中具有强大潜力，基于自适应算法的注意力设计为开发下一代具有更强适应性和鲁棒性的无线基础模型提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

Motivation: 虽然点预测的反事实公平性已有研究，但预测集的公平性在不确定性下的公平决策中至关重要，而现有方法未能解决。同时，保形预测提供有效的预测集但不确保反事实公平性。

Method: 通过对称化保护属性干预的符合度分数，开发了反事实公平保形预测(CF-CP)方法，在保持分布无关、有限样本有效性的同时实现反事实公平。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，CF-CP在回归和分类任务中都能实现期望的反事实公平性，并以最小的预测集大小增加达到目标覆盖率。

Conclusion: CF-CP提供了一种简单、无需训练的路径来实现反事实公平的不确定性量化，填补了公平预测集方法的空白。

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: 为模型干预技术建立了理论基础，提供了将文本信息转化为权重更新的原则性方法，为模型控制提供了更坚实的数学基础。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

Motivation: 大型黑盒模型虽然能处理复杂数据，但缺乏可解释性，在高风险场景中不可靠。SHAP分析虽然能解释特征贡献，但需要进一步分析来理解预测背后的不同原因模式。

Method: 对SHAP值进行聚类分析，将获得相同预测但原因相似的样本分组，识别不同的预测路径。提出了多分类瀑布图的可视化方法，并在模拟实验和阿尔茨海默病数据上验证。

Result: 成功展示了SHAP值聚类能够识别样本获得相同预测的不同原因模式，在阿尔茨海默病案例中发现了不同的疾病发展路径。

Conclusion: SHAP值聚类是一种有效的可解释AI方法，能够揭示黑盒模型预测背后的复杂决策机制，为高风险应用提供更可靠的模型解释。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

Motivation: 深度学习模型虽然预测准确率高，但缺乏可证明的风险和可靠性保证，这在高风险应用中至关重要。传统保形风险控制只能控制期望损失，无法应对尾部风险，且后处理方法会降低平均性能。

Method: 开发了控制OCE风险类的方法（包括条件风险价值CVaR等），并提出了端到端的保形风险训练，在模型训练或微调过程中通过保形OCE风险控制进行反向传播。

Result: 该方法在控制分类器假阴性率和电池储能操作金融风险等应用中，实现了可证明的风险保证，同时相比后处理方法显著提高了平均性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的保形风险训练方法能够为深度学习模型提供可证明的风险控制保证，特别是在尾部风险敏感的应用中，同时保持优异的平均性能。

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

TL;DR: 提出了一个联邦学习框架，用于量化客户端内和客户端间的细粒度跨样本记忆化风险，发现FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FL记忆化检测技术一次只关注一个样本，低估了跨样本记忆化的微妙风险，而集中式学习的细粒度记忆化评估方法无法直接应用于FL。

Method: 提出了一个量化FL中客户端内和客户端间记忆化的框架，使用细粒度跨样本记忆化测量，并研究了解码策略、前缀长度和FL算法等关键影响因素。

Result: 研究发现FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据多于客户端间数据，记忆化程度受训练和推理因素影响。

Conclusion: FL存在记忆化风险，需要更精细的检测方法，提出的框架能够有效量化跨客户端记忆化，为FL隐私保护提供新视角。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

*Mujin Kwun,Depen Morwani,Chloe Huangyuan Su,Stephanie Gil,Nikhil Anand,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LOTION框架，通过随机噪声平滑方法解决量化神经网络优化问题，避免梯度消失问题，保证收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络优化面临根本性挑战，因为量化器是分段常数函数，除了量化阈值处导数未定义外，其他位置梯度为零。现有方法使用STE等技术放松梯度计算，但无法保证收敛。

Method: 受Nesterov平滑启发，提出LOTION框架：使用无偏随机舍入噪声的期望来近似量化损失表面，将原始量化损失替换为平滑版本。

Result: 在该框架下，标准优化器保证收敛到损失表面的局部最小值。使用随机舍入噪声时，原始量化损失的全局最小值得以保留。实验表明该方法在合成测试集和150M/300M参数语言模型上优于标准QAT。

Conclusion: LOTION提供了一个有理论保证的量化优化框架，有效解决了量化神经网络训练中的梯度问题，并在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

TL;DR: 提出Spatial Deconfounder方法，通过将空间干扰转化为多原因信号，同时解决空间因果推断中的未测量混杂因素和干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间因果推断面临两个交织的挑战：未测量的空间混杂因素（如天气、污染）和附近处理的干扰效应。现有方法通常只解决其中一个问题而忽略另一个。

Method: 两阶段方法：使用带有空间先验的条件变分自编码器(CVAE)从局部处理向量重构替代混杂因子，然后通过灵活的结果模型估计因果效应。

Result: 在环境健康和社会科学真实数据集上，Spatial Deconfounder持续改进效应估计，扩展了SpaCE基准套件以包含处理干扰。

Conclusion: 通过将干扰转化为多原因信号，该框架连接了空间和去混杂文献，推进了结构化数据中的稳健因果推断。

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合虚拟成像工具和强化学习的方法来优化CT协议，在保证图像质量的同时显著减少计算步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CT协议优化方法需要穷举测试参数组合，计算成本高且不实用，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 使用验证的CT模拟器对带肝脏病变的人体模型成像，结合新型CT重建工具包，采用PPO强化学习算法优化管电压、管电流、重建核、层厚和像素大小等参数。

Result: 强化学习方法在所有测试案例中都达到了全局最大可检测性指数(d')，同时比穷举搜索减少了79.7%的计算步骤。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了将虚拟成像工具与强化学习相结合用于CT协议管理的潜力，具有灵活性和计算效率。

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习策略在新机器人、任务或具有不同物理参数的环境中往往泛化能力差，限制了实际应用价值。

Method: 利用白金汉π定理将策略的观测和动作映射到无量纲空间，通过缩放实现跨不同物理参数的零样本迁移。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的环境中验证，缩放迁移在动态相似环境下无性能损失，在非相似环境下始终优于朴素迁移方法。

Conclusion: 量纲分析为增强强化学习策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力提供了强大实用的工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在LLM内部编码过程中直接整合结构信息的新范式，通过顺序拼接和并行缓存两种方法生成结构感知的文本嵌入，在多个任务中优于纯文本和后处理基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入模型通常只处理原始文本，忽略了超链接、引用等丰富的结构信息，而这些结构信息在许多真实世界数据集中提供了关键上下文。

Method: 研究了两种内部处理方法：顺序拼接和并行缓存。还引入了上下文蒸馏和语义平衡两种技术来处理噪声结构数据。

Result: 在检索、聚类、分类和推荐任务的零样本实验中，结构感知方法始终优于纯文本和后处理基线。顺序拼接在噪声中等长度上下文中表现更好，而并行缓存在长高信号上下文中扩展性更强但更容易受干扰影响。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次全面分析了内部结构感知编码，为构建更强大和上下文感知的嵌入模型提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL智能体在稀疏奖励环境中探索困难，而LLM拥有程序性知识和推理能力，但现有方法要么强制RL策略遵循LLM建议，要么将其直接纳入奖励函数，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成的动作建议，允许RL智能体学习何时遵循或忽略这些指导，利用LLM的世界知识和推理能力，同时通过软约束保持灵活性。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的BabyAI环境中，LLM指导的效益随任务难度增加而提升。在最复杂环境中，最终成功率相对基线提升71%，样本效率提升高达9倍，且无需修改现有RL算法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用LLM的规划能力加速RL在挑战性环境中的训练，展示了LLM指导在稀疏奖励环境中的显著优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

<details>

Motivation: 解决神经网络函数逼近面临的三个主要挑战：每个目标函数需要从头训练新模型、性能对架构和超参数选择敏感、模型在训练域外泛化能力差。

Method: 首先训练基神经网络逼近参考域上的多项式族，然后使用学习到的参数初始化复杂目标函数的网络，并引入域映射机制将任意域输入转换到参考域。

Result: 在一维和二维设置中的大量数值实验显示，该方法在训练效率、泛化能力和模型可迁移性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于初始化的策略为可扩展和模块化的神经函数逼近提供了有前景的解决方案，完整代码已在Gitee公开。

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

Conclusion: 提出的算法能根据公共次优性差距自适应调整探索策略，在满足检测约束的同时有效识别最佳私有臂。

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

Conclusion: PO-CKAN框架能够准确学习算子，结果与高保真解高度匹配，为参数化时变PDE的快速预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math

on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out
directions for future work.

Motivation: 现有情感识别方法依赖静态融合策略并假设模态输入始终可靠，这在真实学习环境中很少成立，需要更稳健的方法来理解学习者情感

Method: 包含三个关键组件：跨模态注意力对齐模块实现动态跨模态上下文共享，模态重要性估计器为每个时间步的模态分配基于置信度的权重，时间反馈循环利用先前预测确保时间一致性

Result: 在教育子集IEMOCAP和MOSEI上评估，针对困惑、好奇、无聊和沮丧等情感，达到最先进性能，并对缺失或噪声模态表现出强鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该框架能够捕捉情感转换并自适应优先处理可靠信号，非常适合部署在实时学习系统中

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Conclusion: 紧凑的基于transformer的语言模型能够直接从文本图表示中推断图论参数，且通过LoRA微调可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架，用于在资源受限和易受干扰的环境中实现可靠的多视角3D重建，通过两个协作的Q学习代理分别处理相机选择和服务器选择。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架能够在资源受限和易受干扰的环境中实现可靠的多视角3D重建，为关键边缘应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: FairTTE是首个用于评估医学影像中时间到事件预测公平性的综合框架，涵盖多种成像模态和TTE结果，通过因果分析揭示数据集中的偏见来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性研究主要关注医学图像诊断任务，忽视了预后场景中的时间到事件预测，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 整合先进的TTE预测和公平性算法，采用因果分析技术系统分析医学影像预后中的公平性问题。

Result: 大规模评估显示偏见在不同成像模态中普遍存在，现有公平性方法缓解效果有限，分布偏移下公平性更难维持。

Conclusion: 需要针对所有偏见形式的整体方法，开发更稳健、公平的预后模型。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

TL;DR: 本文分析了自监督对比学习(CL)与负样本监督对比学习(NSCL)在表示层面的对齐性，证明了在共享随机性条件下，两者的表示相似性矩阵保持接近，但参数空间耦合不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论表明CL损失近似于NSCL损失，但缺乏对两者在训练过程中表示层面是否保持对齐的研究。

Method: 在共享随机性条件下训练CL和NSCL模型，分析其表示相似性矩阵的接近程度，并证明参数空间耦合的不稳定性。

Result: CL和NSCL的表示相似性矩阵在现实条件下保持接近，对齐性随类别数增加、温度升高而改善，但参数空间耦合会随时间指数级发散。

Conclusion: NSCL可作为自监督与监督学习之间的理论桥梁，表示层面的对齐性优于参数空间耦合。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

TL;DR: 提出自适应时间掩码(ATM)方法解决稀疏自编码器中的特征吸收问题，通过动态调整特征选择来学习稳定可解释的特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器训练方法面临特征吸收问题，特征相互吸收以最小化L1惩罚，导致难以一致识别和分析模型行为

Method: ATM通过跟踪激活幅度、频率和重构贡献来计算随时间演化的重要性分数，基于统计阈值应用概率掩码机制

Result: 在Gemma-2-2b模型上的实验表明，ATM相比TopK和JumpReLU SAEs显著降低吸收分数，同时保持优秀的重构质量

Conclusion: ATM为学习稳定可解释的神经网络特征提供了原则性解决方案，为更可靠的模型分析奠定基础

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种稀疏分解方法来分析人类高级视觉皮层中腹侧、背侧和外侧通路的表征差异，并开发了稀疏成分对齐(SCA)方法来更精确地测量大脑与深度神经网络之间的表征对齐程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么在单任务训练的深度神经网络能够很好地模拟整个视觉系统，尽管人类视觉皮层中的不同通路被认为具有不同的功能过程。

Method: 使用稀疏分解方法识别每个视觉通路中的主导成分，并开发了稀疏成分对齐(SCA)方法来测量大脑与机器之间的表征对齐。

Result: 发现标准视觉DNN与腹侧通路的表征对齐程度高于背侧或外侧通路，SCA方法比传统群体水平几何方法能更精确地揭示这些差异。

Conclusion: SCA方法提供了一种对系统潜在神经调谐轴敏感的表征对齐测量，能够更好地理解大脑与人工视觉系统之间的计算原理差异。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

Conclusion: BPMI在固定计算预算下实现了更高的预测精度，是多保真度高斯过程分类器的有效批量主动学习算法。

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

Conclusion: 提出的CNN框架在多模态子空间聚类中表现出色，不同融合策略都能有效提升性能，特别是亲和融合方法效果显著。

Abstract: We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for
unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of
three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal
decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent
space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing
the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding
to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The
network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original
input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion
techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for
spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are
essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition
to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is
also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different
modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets
show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
multimodal subspace clustering methods.

TL;DR: 提出了Dig-DEC，一种无需乐观主义、仅通过信息增益驱动探索的模型无关决策估计系数，在对抗性环境中优于之前的乐观DEC方法，并在混合MDP中取得了首个模型无关的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于乐观DEC的方法只能处理随机环境，无法扩展到对抗性环境，且在模型类大小上存在遗憾界差距。

Method: 引入Dig-DEC，移除乐观主义，纯粹通过信息增益进行探索；改进了在线函数估计过程，包括平均估计误差最小化和Bellman完备MDP中的平方误差最小化。

Result: Dig-DEC始终不大于乐观DEC，在特殊情况下更小；在混合MDP中获得了首个模型无关的遗憾界；将遗憾界从T^{3/4}提升到T^{2/3}（在线策略）和从T^{5/6}提升到T^{7/9}（离线策略）；在Bellman完备MDP中将遗憾界从T^{2/3}提升到√T。

Conclusion: Dig-DEC是首个在Bellman完备MDP中达到与乐观主义方法相同性能的DEC方法，解决了Liu等人（2025）留下的主要开放问题。

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

Result: 在AIME、MATH和AMC等具有挑战性的基准测试中，ACPO显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: ACPO通过平衡探索和利用，有效解决了信用分配不准确和熵崩溃问题，提升了复杂推理任务的性能。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM在积累少量样本后无需模型训练即可显著降低AoI，而DDPG方法在训练后性能更稳定。

Conclusion: LLM和DDPG的双路径优化方法能有效改善车联网中的AoI性能，两种方法各有优势，可互补使用。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

Result: 在三个典型场景的比较结果显示，该方法在大多数情况下比图深度学习模型（T-GCN）和表格基础模型（TabPFN）具有更优的准确性，表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为时空相关的小地球数据预测提供了一种简单而鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效克服传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

Conclusion: AB-PINNs提供了一种灵活的域分解方法，能够防止收敛到不希望的局部最小值，减少超参数调优需求，特别适用于多尺度问题。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注训练阶段优化，忽视了推理阶段的改进机会。低频特征组合会降低预测性能，导致不可靠输出。

Method: 使用分层概率哈希方法量化特征组合置信度，基于置信度分数进行迭代采样生成多个推理路径，最后聚合多个路径的预测分数进行鲁棒预测。

Result: 离线和在线A/B测试验证了MATT在现有CTR模型上的兼容性和有效性。

Conclusion: MATT能够解锁已训练CTR模型的预测潜力，通过测试时优化提升预测性能。

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

Conclusion: MPC框架通过动态元学习机制有效解决了传统EDL方法的局限性，实现了更好的不确定性建模和适应性。

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction

TL;DR: 提出VARNN模型，通过显式学习预测残差的误差记忆来校准时间序列预测，在非平稳、异方差的时间序列数据上表现优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳性、机制转换和时变噪声等问题，这会降低标准回归模型的鲁棒性

Method: 引入变异性感知递归神经网络(VARNN)，在传统前馈预测器基础上增加学习的误差记忆状态，从近期预测残差中更新该状态作为变异性和漂移信号，并用它来校准当前时间步的最终预测

Result: 在多个领域数据集上的实验结果表明，VARNN在计算开销最小的情况下，相比静态、动态和循环基线方法取得了更低的测试MSE和更优的性能

Conclusion: VARNN模型在漂移和波动环境下提供鲁棒预测，展示了其作为时间序列学习框架的潜力

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

TL;DR: LAGA是一个统一的多智能体框架，通过四个协作智能体（检测、规划、行动、评估）实现文本属性图的质量控制，在稀疏、噪声和不平衡等九种场景下显著提升图质量和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注改进模型架构，而忽略了文本属性图数据本身的系统性优化，导致实际效果有限。图神经网络在文本属性图上的性能对输入质量高度敏感，图质量成为关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出LAGA框架，包含四个协作智能体：检测、规划、行动和评估。核心行动智能体采用双编码器和三目标设计，捕捉跨模态互补信息，执行整体图质量增强。

Result: 在九种场景下的实验表明，LAGA显著提升了图质量，并在各种任务和骨干网络上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 以数据为中心的质量优化是实现可靠文本属性图和稳健图学习的关键。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in
artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data
annotation and model training remain significant. A fundamental objective of AI
research is to achieve robust generalization with limited-resource data. This
survey employs agnostic active sampling theory within the Probably
Approximately Correct (PAC) framework to analyze the generalization error and
label complexity associated with learning from low-resource data in both
model-agnostic supervised and unsupervised settings. Based on this analysis, we
investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data
learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration
optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索学习优化器是否能够学习正则化效果，挑战传统显式正则化的必要性。

Method: 在标准基准测试(MNIST、FMNIST、CIFAR)和神经网络(MLP、MLP-Relu、CNN)上，比较使用和不使用显式正则化器训练的学习优化器。

Result: 正则化的学习优化器在测试准确率和泛化能力方面始终优于未正则化的对应模型，并能将正则化效果迁移到新的优化任务中。

Conclusion: 学习优化器能够固有地学习正则化特性，挑战了传统显式优化损失正则化的必要性。

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

TL;DR: 本文提出RLER方法，通过集成多个模型并自适应奖励插值和轨迹选择，解决了RLIR中模型对高置信度轨迹过度奖励的系统偏差问题，在无标注数据上实现了稳定扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR依赖标注样本限制了数据扩展，而RLIR在无标注设置中性能不稳定，主要原因是模型对自身高置信度轨迹存在过度奖励的系统偏差。

Method: 提出RLER方法：1）集成多个模型聚合奖励；2）自适应奖励插值；3）轨迹选择策略。通过三个偏差指标分析系统偏差。

Result: RLER相比RLIR提升13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，在无标注样本上实现了稳定扩展。

Conclusion: RLER有效缓解了RLIR的系统偏差问题，在无标注设置中接近RLVR性能，具有很好的应用前景。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

TL;DR: 提出FedL2T个性化联邦学习框架，通过双教师知识蒸馏策略解决癫痫预测中数据异质性问题，在保护隐私的同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫预测需要大量EEG数据，但标注成本高且涉及隐私。联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但在现实场景中由于患者间差异性，现有方法在异构客户端设置下难以获得稳健性能。

Method: 采用个性化联邦学习框架FedL2T，包含：1）新颖的双教师知识蒸馏策略，每个客户端同时从全局聚合模型和动态分配的同伴模型学习；2）自适应多级蒸馏策略，基于任务置信度对齐预测输出和中间特征表示；3）引入近端正则化项约束个性化模型更新。

Result: 在两个EEG数据集上的实验表明，FedL2T始终优于最先进的FL方法，特别是在低标签条件下。同时表现出快速稳定的收敛特性，减少了通信轮次和相关开销。

Conclusion: FedL2T作为隐私敏感医疗场景中癫痫预测的可靠个性化解决方案具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法如CoT、ToT等扩展了搜索空间但经常产生不可行动作或幻觉步骤，无法确保计划与用户意图对齐并满足符号约束。

Method: 使用(intent, constraint)对作为结构化先验，压缩搜索空间并强制执行有效性，将其集成到MCTS中修剪不可行分支并引导探索。

Result: 在Risk游戏、CAD代码生成和算术推理三个领域验证，相比基线方法获得更高准确性和更强的结构对齐。

Conclusion: Const-o-T为约束引导推理提供了可泛化的基础，使LLMs能够进行更高效、约束对齐和领域适应的规划。

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

Conclusion: PlatformX提供了一个完全自动化和可转移的硬件感知神经架构搜索框架，能够高效地为边缘设备设计优化的深度神经网络。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code

Conclusion: SQS框架通过贝叶斯变分学习成功统一了剪枝和量化，实现了更优的神经网络压缩效果

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法假设能获得干净、定义明确的遗忘数据，但现实中的遗忘数据可能是低质量、合成改写或带水印的，这引发了遗忘可靠性的担忧。

Method: 系统性地在噪声遗忘集上对最先进的LLM遗忘方法（RMU和NPO）进行基准测试，并提出基于显著性的解释框架。

Result: 研究发现遗忘对扰动具有惊人的鲁棒性，遗忘算法主要受深层语义线索而非浅层词汇模式引导。

Conclusion: 关键语义组件在表面形式大幅变化的情况下仍能保持一致的遗忘驱动作用，这解释了遗忘在噪声数据下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

TL;DR: 提出Value-State Gated Attention (VGA)机制，通过基于值向量的可学习门控来打破注意力与值状态之间的恶性循环，有效缓解极端token现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构的大模型容易受到极端token现象（如注意力汇和值状态流失）的影响，这些现象会降低模型性能、量化保真度和可解释性，源于注意力机制与值状态之间的相互强化问题。

Method: VGA引入基于值向量的可学习数据依赖门控，直接调制注意力输出，通过理论梯度分析证明这种方法比基于输入嵌入的门控更有效。

Result: 实验表明VGA显著减轻了注意力汇的形成，稳定了值状态范数，提升了模型性能、量化鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: VGA提供了一种简单、专用且稳定的架构机制，通过直接打破注意力与值状态之间的循环来高效执行'无操作'注意力。

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

TL;DR: Slim Scheduler是一个混合调度框架，结合PPO强化学习策略和贪心调度器，用于协调可瘦身模型的分布式推理，实现动态适应异构硬件和运行时条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络调度研究主要关注优化静态、固定宽度的端到端模型，忽视了能够适应异构硬件和波动运行时条件的动态方法。

Method: 采用分层设计：每个服务器运行本地贪心调度器进行请求批处理和实例扩展管理，PPO路由器学习全局路由策略（设备选择、宽度比例、批配置）。

Result: 相比纯随机任务分配基线，Slim Scheduler可实现多种准确性和延迟权衡：在最瘦模型（70.3%准确率）下，平均延迟减少96.45%，能耗减少97.31%；在提高准确率的同时仍能减少平均延迟和能耗，但延迟和能耗的标准差会增大。

Conclusion: 该分层设计降低了搜索空间复杂度，减轻了对特定硬件的过拟合，平衡了效率和吞吐量。

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了近十年来AI系统训练的环境影响，发现即使采用优化策略，机器学习模型训练的环境影响仍在指数级增长，存在反弹效应，仅靠效率提升无法确保可持续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习性能提升，计算需求激增导致能源消耗和环境问题日益严重，需要评估现有优化策略是否能实现可持续的ML模型训练。

Method: 通过估算过去十年中包括大语言模型在内的著名AI系统训练的环境影响，重点关注显卡的整个生命周期分析。

Result: 研究发现显卡生产环境影响持续增加，ML模型训练能耗和环境影响呈指数增长，优化策略无法抵消训练带来的影响，存在反弹效应。

Conclusion: 仅提高效率无法确保ML的可持续性，必须减少AI活动规模、质疑资源密集型训练的频次，并考虑硬件的全生命周期影响而非仅使用阶段。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

TL;DR: 当前语言模型防御评估方法存在缺陷，应使用自适应攻击者进行测试。通过系统优化技术，成功绕过了12种近期防御方法，多数防御的攻击成功率从接近零提升至90%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对语言模型防御的评估方法存在问题，主要使用静态攻击集或计算能力较弱的优化方法，未能充分考虑自适应攻击者的威胁。

Method: 系统调整和扩展通用优化技术，包括梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索和人工引导探索，针对12种不同技术的防御方法进行攻击测试。

Result: 成功绕过了所有12种防御方法，大多数防御的攻击成功率从接近零提升至90%以上，证明现有防御方法的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 未来的防御工作必须考虑更强的攻击方法，如本文描述的自适应攻击，才能做出可靠且令人信服的鲁棒性声明。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒方法存在三个关键问题：仅针对短视对抗攻击训练、难以引发真正安全关键事件、缺乏鲁棒约束导致训练不稳定

Method: IGCARL包含战略目标对抗者和鲁棒驾驶代理，对抗者执行战略协调多步攻击，代理在约束条件下学习鲁棒策略

Result: 实验显示IGCARL比最先进方法成功率提高至少27.9%，显著增强对抗攻击鲁棒性和安全性

Conclusion: IGCARL能有效提升DRL自动驾驶策略的对抗鲁棒性，增强安全性和可靠性

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法在提高模型鲁棒性时往往牺牲了在干净数据上的准确性，需要一种能平衡自然准确性和对抗鲁棒性的方法。

Method: MemLoss通过跨训练周期重用先前生成的对抗样本（记忆对抗样本），将这些样本纳入训练过程来增强模型学习。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有对抗训练方法获得了更好的准确性，同时保持了强大的对抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MemLoss提供了一种有效的对抗训练方法，能够在保持自然准确性的同时显著提升模型鲁棒性，实现了更好的平衡性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the
adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously
generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,'
to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on
clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a
balanced improvement in both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness.
Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that
our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training
methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

Motivation: 现有方法基于数据记录的平均隐私风险评估群体隐私风险，可能低估群体间隐私风险的差异，且最坏情况隐私风险评估方法耗时较长，限制了实际应用。

Method: 引入新型成员推理游戏来高效审计近似最坏情况隐私风险；改进标准DP-SGD算法，采用自适应群体特定梯度裁剪策略。

Conclusion: 提出的方法增强了差分隐私机器学习中隐私保护的公平性，为群体隐私风险评估提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

Motivation: 交通是温室气体排放的主要来源，需要向电动汽车等可持续替代方案过渡，但充电基础设施空间分布不均和使用不规律给电网稳定性和投资规划带来挑战。

Method: 使用图卷积网络结合时序架构，利用真实交通流量、天气条件和美国最大EV基础设施公司提供的专有数据，捕捉空间依赖性和时间动态。

Result: 实验表明3小时中期预测在响应性和稳定性间平衡最佳，1DCNN始终优于其他时序模型。区域分析显示东、中、西田纳西州预测精度存在差异，反映了站点密度、人口和本地需求变异性对模型性能的影响。

Conclusion: TW-GCN框架推进了数据驱动智能在EV基础设施规划中的整合，支持可持续交通转型和弹性电网管理。

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录支持临床预测的深度学习，但由于评估实践不一致，患者数据的最佳表示方法仍不明确。

Method: 创建标准化基准，在MIMIC-IV和EHRSHOT数据集上比较三种EHR表示范式：多变量时间序列、事件流和文本事件流，评估包括Transformers、MLP、LSTM、Retain、CLMBR、计数模型和LLM等多种模型。

Result: 事件流模型始终表现最佳；预训练模型在少样本场景中样本效率高；ICU预测需要修剪稀疏特征，而纵向任务需要保留稀疏特征。

Conclusion: 通过统一可复现的流程，为基于临床背景和数据情况选择EHR表示提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

Conclusion: 分割技术通过减少时间模糊性，促进了监督算法的学习过程，为工业异常检测提供了显著优势。

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

Motivation: 持续学习的目标是实现类似人类的持续学习能力，但其核心挑战灾难性遗忘的深层原因尚未被充分理解。本文旨在揭示灾难性遗忘的机制，特别是新任务训练如何影响旧任务知识。

Method: 通过理论分析发现，新任务梯度会自动与旧任务损失函数的尖锐方向对齐，这种对抗性对齐源于训练的低秩偏差。作者提出了backGP方法，专门解决反向传播引起的对齐问题。

Result: 实验表明，backGP方法相比梯度投影方法平均减少遗忘10.8%，提高准确率12.7%。

Conclusion: 灾难性遗忘的本质是新任务训练对旧任务知识的对抗性攻击，backGP方法通过解决反向传播引起的梯度对齐问题，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

Motivation: 传统CTC解码器在资源受限环境中面临计算和内存瓶颈，在wav2vec2-large等系统中占用高达90%的处理时间，主要由于详尽的token级操作导致效率低下。

Method: 提出帧级token剪枝算法FLToP CTC，使用相对阈值概率指导每帧低概率token的动态剪除，减少计算和内存需求。

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上，FLToP CTC相比标准CTC解码器实现10.5倍运行时加速和2.78倍内存减少，同时WER退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: FLToP CTC有效解决CTC瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境和实时应用提供可扩展性，提升语音识别的可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有的提示优化方法仅限于文本，限制了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的潜力，因此需要扩展到多模态空间。

Method: 提出多模态提示优化器（MPO），通过保持对齐的联合更新来优化多模态提示，并利用贝叶斯选择策略指导候选提示的选择。

Result: 在图像、视频甚至分子等多种模态上的实验表明，MPO优于领先的纯文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现MLLMs潜力的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Motivation: 神经生理学记录（如EEG）产生高维、嘈杂的时间序列数据，传统方法需要大量预处理和手工特征提取。需要开发更有效的表示学习方法来解码和解释生物信号。

Method: 提出BioCodec框架，受神经编解码器启发，将生物信号的低级特征捕获为离散令牌。在数千小时EEG数据上预训练，支持多种下游任务。

Conclusion: BioCodec提供了一个通用的生物信号令牌化解决方案，性能与最先进模型相当。代码和模型检查点已共享。

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

TL;DR: 本文通过应用完整的高斯-牛顿预条件处理，建立了LLM预训练迭代复杂度的实际上界，发现该方法相比现有优化器可减少5.4倍训练迭代次数，且层间预条件处理器性能接近完整方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在LLM预训练中，计算效率高的近似方法会牺牲多少性能，为大规模训练建立迭代复杂度的实际上界。

Method: 对最多1.5亿参数的Transformer模型应用完整高斯-牛顿预条件处理，并与层间预条件处理器进行比较。

Result: 完整GN更新相比SOAP和Muon等强基线实现了5.4倍训练迭代减少，层间GN预条件处理器性能接近完整方法。

Conclusion: GN近似对预条件处理非常有效，层间Hessian结构包含足够信息实现大部分潜在增益，当前近似方法与理想层间oracle存在显著性能差距。

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

TL;DR: 该研究通过动力学系统框架将softmax、norm和linear注意力表示为动力学系统，并与状态空间模型进行特征值谱比较，揭示了特征值对序列模型记忆和长程依赖建模的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然softmax注意力在序列模型中表现出色，但其二次复杂度限制了可扩展性，而线性替代方法如状态空间模型在效率上有所改进，但这些方法在信息处理上的根本差异尚未被充分理解。

Method: 利用动力学系统框架表示不同类型的注意力机制，通过分析特征值谱与状态空间模型进行系统比较，并在多种序列模型和基准测试上进行实证分析。

Result: 特征值影响记忆和长程依赖建模的关键方面，揭示了与任务需求一致的光谱特征，架构修改对特征值谱和任务性能有对应影响。

Conclusion: 特征值分析为解释、理解和改进序列模型能力提供了一个原则性的度量标准。

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了深入理解不同深度序列模型（如Transformer、状态空间模型、门控线性RNN等）的内在机制，并系统比较这些架构，需要建立一个统一的数学框架来揭示它们共同的输出计算模式。

Method: 开发了一个统一框架，将线性组合系数建模为由脉冲输入驱动的自主线性动力系统的输出，从而显式化序列模型的输出操作，并捕获包括softmax注意力在内的多种架构。

Result: 该框架揭示了不同序列模型架构间的共同数学主题，识别了表达能力与高效实现之间的权衡、输入选择性的几何约束，以及数值稳定训练和信息保留的稳定性条件。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅解释了近期设计在实证上的成功，还为系统设计新的序列模型架构提供了指导原则，通过连接文献中的多个见解和观察，推动了序列模型的理论理解。

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在对抗性延迟反馈环境下的上下文多臂老虎机问题，其中损失观测会延迟到达，且延迟由对手选择

Method: 使用有限策略类直接访问和一般函数逼近方法，结合在线最小二乘回归预言机，并提出了基于Hedge的Vovk聚合预测器的稳定性分析

Result: 有限策略类下获得最优期望遗憾界O(√(KT log|Π|) + √(D log|Π|))；一般函数逼近下获得O(√(KT R_T(O)) + √(d_max D β))，其中β ≤ log|F|时得到O(√(KT log|F|) + √(d_max D log|F|))

Conclusion: 提出的算法在延迟反馈环境下实现了接近最优的遗憾界，但相比下界存在√d_max的差距，为延迟反馈CMAB问题提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

Motivation: 解决在线随机匹配问题中由于NP难特性导致的计算困难，通过引入单峰偏好结构来降低计算复杂度，使在线学习变得可行。

Method: 使用基于PQ树的顺序近似方法来处理未知单峰结构的情况，开发了高效的离线预算匹配算法，并将其转化为在线算法；对于已知单峰结构的情况，设计了类似UCB的高效算法。

Result: 对于未知单峰结构的情况，获得了O(UKT^{2/3})的遗憾界；对于已知单峰结构的情况，获得了O(U√(TK))的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 单峰偏好结构能够显著简化在线随机匹配问题的计算复杂度，提出的算法在理论和实践上都具有重要意义。

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

Result: 结果表明，该方法可以从仅数百到数千个成对比较中学习模拟专家的复杂多元信念密度。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法能够有效地从有限的成对比较数据中估计复杂的多元密度，为专家知识获取和人类反馈学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

TL;DR: AI控制协议依赖LLM监控器作为防御机制，但面临自适应攻击威胁，攻击者通过嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入来规避监控，导致当前基于监控器的协议失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI控制协议中的自适应攻击，因为现有协议依赖LLM监控器作为单点故障，攻击者可能知晓协议和监控模型细节，从而设计规避策略。

Method: 实例化简单自适应攻击向量，攻击者在模型输出中嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入，测试前沿模型在主要AI控制基准上的规避能力。

Result: 前沿模型能够持续规避多样化监控器并完成恶意任务，攻击对所有依赖监控器的当前协议普遍有效，Defer-to-Resample协议甚至适得其反。

Conclusion: 对监控模型的自适应攻击是当前控制协议的主要盲点，应成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs领域适应中的权衡问题：提升专业领域能力通常会导致通用能力下降。现有方法在计算、数据访问或适应性方面成本高昂。

Method: 两阶段框架：阶段0记录动态Top-K token子集（覆盖概率阈值并包含黄金标签）；阶段1重放这些紧凑子集计算精确重归一化损失。配合MoClip优化器，限制梯度动量旋转并基于arctan2重新缩放更新。

Result: 在通信技术和NL2SQL任务上提升领域性能，同时在通用基准（MMLU、BBH、GPQA、MATH）上减轻遗忘，训练成本降低40%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs领域适应提供了一条可扩展、架构无关的路径，无需牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and
SVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: BaNEL是一种仅使用失败尝试进行后训练的算法，通过最小化奖励评估次数来改进生成模型在稀疏奖励任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在重要问题的最困难实例中，基础生成模型往往获得接近零的奖励信号，且奖励函数调用成本高昂，这给标准基于奖励的后训练带来了不同挑战。

Method: 将学习失败规律的问题转化为另一个生成建模问题，利用该模型评估新数据是否类似于先前见过的失败，并引导生成远离这些失败。

Result: BaNEL在多个稀疏奖励任务中，无需观察任何成功样本即可提高模型性能，在成功率上比现有新颖性奖励方法高出几个数量级，同时使用更少的奖励评估。

Conclusion: BaNEL能够有效处理稀疏奖励环境中的学习挑战，仅通过分析失败样本就能显著提升生成质量。

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的应用增多，能耗和数据隐私成为重要问题。设备端学习能降低能耗并保护数据隐私，但现代神经网络规模扩大成为设备端训练的主要障碍。

Method: 应用基于子空间的训练方法到Transformer模型，引入权重-激活子空间迭代(WASI)方法，通过限制训练在固定子空间内来缓解反向传播的内存瓶颈。

Result: WASI在保持与标准训练相当准确率的同时，内存使用减少高达62倍，计算成本(FLOPs)减少高达2倍。在树莓派5上，训练和推理速度比标准训练快约1.5倍。

Conclusion: WASI方法有效解决了Transformer模型在设备端训练中的内存和计算瓶颈问题，为高效设备端学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

Conclusion: GCM为功能脑网络结构学习提供了新视角，为认知神经科学的跨学科应用奠定了基础

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中存在非确定性和不可重现性问题，主要源于随机数生成和浮点计算。虽然随机性可以通过确定性配置控制，但浮点不一致性问题仍未解决。

Method: 开发RepDL开源库，通过强制正确的浮点数舍入和顺序不变性来实现确定性和比特级可重现的深度学习训练和推理。

Result: RepDL能够确保深度学习训练和推理在不同计算环境中的确定性和比特级可重现性。

Conclusion: RepDL成功解决了深度学习中的浮点计算不一致性问题，为跨平台可重现性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is
available at https://github.com/microsoft/RepDL .

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Flow Matching教师模型和MLP学生策略的强化学习方法，通过奖励模型和正则化机制解决FM策略在线交互的梯度不稳定和推理成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching在模仿学习中表现出色，但缺乏环境交互和探索能力，在未见场景中泛化能力差。直接在线优化FM策略存在梯度不稳定和高推理成本的问题。

Method: 使用MLP结构的学生策略进行环境探索和在线RL更新，通过基于教师FM模型的奖励模型提供专家数据分布信息，并用教师FM模型正则化学生策略行为以稳定学习。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升了学习效率、泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在从次优专家数据学习时表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过简单MLP学生策略与复杂FM教师模型的结合，既避免了FM策略的梯度问题，又保留了其表达能力，实现了高效的在线强化学习。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

Method: 引入了质蕴涵解释（最小充分原因）的新表述，并提出了在小规模反应预测任务中计算此类解释的算法

Result: 初步实验表明，该方法保守地捕捉了真实解释，虽然可能包含冗余的键和原子，但始终捕获了预测反应可行性的关键分子属性

Conclusion: 该方法为化学反应预测模型提供了有效的可解释性工具

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

Conclusion: 提出的时间感知数据共享框架能够公平奖励早期参与者，促进协作数据共享的可持续性。

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

Motivation: 传统Modelica模型中的代数环会显著降低仿真效率，且存在多解模糊问题，需要一种能保持精度同时大幅加速仿真的方法。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络，在损失函数中直接使用代数环的残差进行训练，无需监督数据集，通过残差训练策略确保收敛到一致解。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统中，相比传统仿真方法实现了60%的仿真时间减少，同时通过误差控制机制保持了相同的精度水平。

Conclusion: 残差驱动的机器学习方法能有效替代代数环，显著提升仿真效率，同时解决多解模糊问题，为大规模系统仿真提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限环境中的利益相关者提供了一种无需重新训练或访问模型内部的实用安全对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

Motivation: 标准评估指标往往无法反映人类偏好，而人类评估虽然更可靠但成本高且噪声大。现有Bradley-Terry方法要么忽略评估者变异性，要么缺乏收敛保证。

Method: BBQ使用贝叶斯Bradley-Terry变体，显式建模评估者质量，通过期望最大化算法提供单调似然收敛保证，降权或移除不可靠的参与者。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现更可靠和成本效益更高的生成模型人类评估。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

Method: 提出CHUCKLE框架，通过众包数据集中的标注者一致性和对齐度来定义样本难度，假设对人类困难的样本对机器学习模型同样困难

Result: 实验结果显示CHUCKLE使LSTM相对平均准确率提升6.56%，Transformer提升1.61%，同时减少了梯度更新次数

Conclusion: CHUCKLE通过感知驱动的课程学习有效提升了训练效率和模型鲁棒性

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

Conclusion: HINT框架通过提高训练亲和力，有效解决了强化学习在长链推理任务中的训练挑战，为LLM的推理能力提升提供了更稳定和高效的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

Result: 发现1e-2到1e-1的标准差范围提供稳定的训练区域；Kaiming初始化在ReLU网络中收敛更快更稳定；GPT-2模型中浅层权重方差快速扩展，深层变化更平缓。

Conclusion: 研究连接了经典初始化原则与现代transformer行为，为稳健训练提供了简单实用的初始化方案。

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

Conclusion: 正交对齐现象揭示了交叉注意力机制的新工作机制，为多模态研究中的参数高效缩放提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

*Faried Abu Zaid,Tim Katzke,Emmanuel Müller,Daniel Neider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明均匀缩放流(USFs)作为一类特殊的归一化流，通过理论分析将深度单类分类(如Deep SVDD)和密度估计两种异常检测范式统一起来，并建议在实际应用中用USFs替代非USFs以获得更好的性能和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测领域存在两种主流范式：深度单类分类学习紧凑的正常数据表示，而密度估计直接建模正常数据的似然。本文旨在揭示这两种方法之间的理论联系，并找到能够同时继承两者优点的统一框架。

Method: 通过理论证明，训练均匀缩放流(USFs)的最大似然目标等价于Deep SVDD目标加上独特的正则化项，这种正则化能天然防止表示坍塌。USFs既保持了流的密度忠实性，又具备单类方法的距离推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，USFs在负对数似然和潜在空间范数之间建立了比Deep SVDD或非USFs更紧密的对齐关系。将USFs作为非USFs的替代品应用于现代异常检测架构，在多个基准测试和模型骨干上均获得了性能提升和训练稳定性改善。

Conclusion: USFs统一了异常检测的两大主要范式，不仅推进了理论理解，还提升了实际性能。建议在异常检测架构中采用USFs作为非USFs的直接替代方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

Abstract: This study develops an interpretable machine learning framework to forecast
startup outcomes, including funding, patenting, and exit. A firm-quarter panel
for 2010-2023 is constructed from Crunchbase and matched to U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) data. Three horizons are evaluated: next funding

initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition within 36 months. Preprocessing is
fit on a development window (2010-2019) and applied without change to later
cohorts to avoid leakage. Class imbalance is addressed using inverse-prevalence
weights and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and
Continuous features (SMOTE-NC). Logistic regression and tree ensembles,
including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are compared using
the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) and the area under the

Conclusion: 该框架为潜在流形的几何分析提供了通用工具，支持不同的黎曼几何结构，且独立于底层自编码器架构。

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Motivation: 扩散模型在局部区域天气预报中表现良好但计算成本高昂，而基于CRPS训练的全球天气预报模型已取得成功，因此希望开发一种更高效的局部区域概率预报方法

Method: 提出CRPS-LAM模型，通过采样和注入单个潜在噪声向量到模型中，在单次前向传播中生成集成成员，使用基于CRPS的目标进行训练

Result: 在MEPS区域数据集上，CRPS-LAM匹配了扩散模型的低误差水平，采样速度比扩散模型快39倍，同时保留了精细尺度预报细节

Conclusion: CRPS-LAM是概率区域天气预报的一种有效方法，在保持预报质量的同时大幅提升了计算效率

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

TL;DR: 本文研究了在局部差分隐私(LDP)约束下从分布中采样的局部极小极大风险问题，发现在固定分布P0邻域内的最优采样器由全局极小极大风险决定，并给出了不依赖于f-散度的闭式解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注跨分布类的全局极小极大最优性，而本文从局部视角出发，研究在固定分布P0邻域内的极小极大风险，这更贴近实际应用中存在公共数据分布的场景。

Method: 将先前纯LDP工作扩展到泛函LDP框架，证明当分布类限制在P0邻域时，全局最优泛函LDP采样器就是局部最优采样器，并推导出局部极小极大最优采样器的闭式表达式。

Result: 确定了局部极小极大风险的确切值，该值取决于P0和隐私水平，且局部最优采样器在包含公共数据的实际场景中持续优于全局极小极大采样器。

Conclusion: 局部框架为私有采样提供了更实用的理论分析工具，特别是在存在公共数据分布的场景下，局部最优采样器比全局方法表现更优。

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

Motivation: 研究在线对抗模仿学习（AIL），其中智能体从离线专家演示中学习并与环境在线交互而无需奖励。尽管实证结果强劲，但在线交互的好处和随机性的影响仍不清楚。

Method: 引入基于模型的AIL算法（MB-AIL），在专家数据和无奖励交互的一般函数逼近下建立其无视野、二阶样本复杂度保证。

Result: MB-AIL在在线交互中实现了极小极大最优样本复杂度（达到对数因子），并且在专家演示方面与下界匹配，就视野H、精度ε和策略方差σ²的依赖性而言。实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: MB-AIL算法在在线对抗模仿学习中实现了最优样本效率，特别是在系统接近确定性时表现更佳，实验证明其样本效率与现有方法相当或更优。

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

Motivation: 现有物理模型和数据驱动模型由于环境生态系统中固有的数据异质性，难以泛化到不同空间区域和尺度。这个问题因有限的观测样本而进一步加剧。

Method: 提出地理感知嵌入，利用地理信息显式捕获跨空间区域和尺度的共享原理和模式。将该嵌入集成到门控时空图神经网络中，使模型能够在地理和水文背景指导下学习复杂时空模式。

Result: 在美国东海岸多个流域37年真实数据集上的评估显示，Geo-STARS在跨区域和尺度的泛化性能优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: Geo-STARS为可扩展、数据高效的环境监测和决策制定提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

Abstract: There are many critical challenges in optimizing neural network models,
including distributed computing, compression techniques, and efficient

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS是一个轻量级的无监督框架，用于结构感知的时间序列摘要化，通过自适应压缩时间序列为紧凑的标记序列，实现高达30倍的序列压缩同时保留核心时间动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型通常处理原始或固定窗口序列，将所有时间步视为同等信息量，导致在长序列或噪声序列中效率低下、鲁棒性差和可扩展性有限。时间序列数据中的潜在时间结构、局部平稳状态转换、重复模式等特征很少在标准表示学习流程中被利用。

Method: STaTS使用基于BIC的统计差异准则在多个时间分辨率上检测变化点，然后使用简单函数（如均值）或生成模型（如GMM）对每个片段进行摘要化。该框架作为模型无关的预处理器，可与现有无监督时间序列编码器集成而无需重新训练。

Result: 在150多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，STaTS能够达到完整模型性能的85-90%，同时显著降低计算成本。在UCR-85、UCR-128、UEA-30档案的分类任务以及ETTh1、ETTh2、ETTm1和Electricity的预测任务中表现优异。STaTS在噪声下提高了鲁棒性，并保留了判别结构，优于均匀和基于聚类的压缩基线。

Conclusion: STaTS作为一个原则性的通用解决方案，为高效、结构感知的时间序列建模提供了有效方法，实现了序列压缩与性能保持的良好平衡。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

Conclusion: MODE不仅能区分增殖和分化动态，还能预测细胞何时承诺其最终命运，解决了计算生物学中的关键挑战

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.
