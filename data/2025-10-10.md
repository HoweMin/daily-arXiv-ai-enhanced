### [1] [Truth-Aware Decoding: A Program-Logic Approach to Factual Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07331)
*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD) 是一种验证导向的解码方案，通过知识库对齐神经语言生成，在解码时使用语义防护机制减少幻觉而不影响吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大规模经验模型与形式验证相结合，解决神经语言生成中的幻觉问题，确保生成内容与知识库的一致性。

Method: 基于概率程序语义学，TAD在指令调优系统中引入语义防护格，包括约束语义、贪心选择理论、事实风险量化熵不变性以及多智能体操作演算。

Result: 数值和算法案例研究表明，TAD的防护机制能有效减少幻觉，同时保持吞吐量，为经验模型与形式验证提供了实用桥梁。

Conclusion: TAD成功构建了神经语言生成与知识库对齐的验证框架，通过形式化方法减少幻觉，实现了经验模型与形式验证的有效结合。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

### [2] [L2M-AID: Autonomous Cyber-Physical Defense by Fusing Semantic Reasoning of Large Language Models with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07363)
*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Jun Wang,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L2M-AID是一个基于LLM增强的多智能体强化学习框架，用于工业物联网的自主防御，通过语义感知状态表示和协作策略显著提升安全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网的普及使关键网络物理系统面临传统防御无法应对的复杂多阶段攻击，需要具备上下文感知能力的自适应安全解决方案。

Method: 融合LLM和MARL：使用LLM将非结构化遥测数据转换为语义感知状态表示，利用MAPPO算法学习协作策略，奖励函数平衡安全目标和操作稳定性。

Result: 在SWaT数据集和MITRE ATT&CK ICS合成数据集上测试，检测率达到97.2%，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提升4倍，同时保持物理过程稳定性。

Conclusion: L2M-AID为关键国家基础设施安全提供了一个强大的新范式，通过LLM和MARL的深度融合实现了自适应和弹性的工业防御。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

### [3] [Base Models Know How to Reason, Thinking Models Learn When](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07364)
*Constantin Venhoff,Iván Arcuschin,Philip Torr,Arthur Conmy,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 思考模型（如DeepSeek R1）通过有效激活基础模型中已有的推理机制来提升性能，而非学习全新能力。混合模型在仅引导12%token的情况下恢复了91%的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思考模型性能提升的本质：是学习全新推理能力还是重新利用基础模型已有能力。

Method: 提出无监督、自下而上的方法发现思考模型中的可解释推理行为，构建混合模型在基础模型中适时激活推理机制。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，混合模型无需权重更新即可恢复思考模型91%的性能差距，仅引导12%的token。

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型已获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段教会模型在适当时机高效部署这些机制，实现推理计算的优化使用。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

### [4] [Position: AI Will Transform Neuropsychology Through Mental Health Digital Twins for Dynamic Mental Health Care, Especially for ADHD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07409)
*Neil Natarajan,Sruthi Viswanathan,Xavier Roberts-Gaal,Michelle Marie Martel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出从静态心理健康评估转向AI驱动的连续评估，以ADHD为例，探讨生成式AI如何解决神经心理学容量限制，实现个性化、纵向护理路径，并引入心理健康数字孪生概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维需求，当前心理健康诊断存在容量限制，需要更个性化、连续的护理方法。

Method: 利用生成式AI进行频繁、低水平体验采样，促进诊断协调，构建心理健康数字孪生作为连续更新的计算模型。

Result: AI能够实现更频繁的患者数据采集，为个性化护理提供基础，数字孪生框架可捕捉个体症状动态和轨迹。

Conclusion: 连续、丰富的患者中心数据采样可动态适应个体需求，改善治疗可及性和有效性，心理健康数字孪生是变革性框架。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

### [5] [ProSEA: Problem Solving via Exploration Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07423)
*William Nguyen,Vinh Luong,Christopher Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProSEA是一个模块化的多智能体框架，通过探索和计划演化实现迭代问题解决，在FinanceBench基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI智能体大多局限于静态规划和脆弱交互，缺乏真正的协作或自适应推理能力。

Method: 采用分层架构，管理器智能体协调领域专家智能体，分解任务，并根据失败尝试的结构化反馈进行自适应重规划。

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人类反馈，ProSEA也优于最先进的基线方法，在推理密集型任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: ProSEA有潜力成为更透明、自适应且与人类对齐的AI智能体的基础框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

### [6] [Less is More: Strategic Expert Selection Outperforms Ensemble Complexity in Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07426)
*Walid Guettala,Yufan Zhao,László Gulyás*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

*Penghang Liu,Elizabeth Fons,Svitlana Vyetrenko,Daniel Borrajo,Vamsi Potluru,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TS-Agent是一个时间序列推理代理，通过将LLMs擅长的证据收集和推理与时间序列分析工具结合，避免多模态对齐训练，在推理任务上显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，存在幻觉和知识泄漏问题，需要专门设计来提升时间序列推理能力。

Method: 使用原子操作符与原始数值序列交互，记录证据日志，通过自批判和质量门控迭代优化推理过程，避免将时间序列转换为文本、图像或嵌入。

Result: 在理解基准测试中达到与最先进LLMs相当的性能，在推理任务上显著改进，特别是在零样本设置中表现突出。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过合理分工和显式证据记录，有效解决了时间序列推理中的幻觉和知识泄漏问题，提供了可解释和可验证的推理过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: 提出了ExpertAgent智能代理框架，通过动态规划学习内容和策略，基于持续更新的学生模型提供个性化教育，减少大语言模型幻觉风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成式AI在教育中缺乏实时适应性、个性化和内容可靠性的问题。

ExpertAgent - an intelligent agent framework designed for personalized
education that provides reliable knowledge and enables highly adaptive learning
experiences. Therefore, we developed ExpertAgent, an innovative learning agent
that provides users with a proactive and personalized learning experience.
ExpertAgent dynamic planning of the learning content and strategy based on a
continuously updated student model. Therefore, overcoming the limitations of
traditional static learning content to provide optimized teaching strategies
and learning experience in real time. All instructional content is grounded in
a validated curriculum repository, effectively reducing hallucination risks in
large language models and improving reliability and trustworthiness.

*Akhil Kumar,Jianliang Leon Zhao,Om Dobariya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs如ChatGPT能够理解BPMN流程模型图像，在零样本设置下有效识别语法和逻辑错误，并通过自然语言界面进行深度推理，可作为业务流程设计的智能助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在理解业务流程模型、发现错误和深度推理方面的能力，探索其在业务流程设计中的辅助作用。

Method: 使用多个LLMs（包括ChatGPT模型o3）在零样本设置下测试其对BPMN流程模型图像的理解能力，分析其语法、逻辑和语义层面的表现。

Result: 未经训练的LLM能够有效理解BPMN流程模型并智能回答相关问题，不同LLMs在准确性和有效性方面表现各异，LLMs展现出类人特性。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为业务流程设计者和用户的有价值助手，具备深度推理能力，并表现出类人化特征。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

### [10] [Optimizing Ethical Risk Reduction for Medical Intelligent Systems with Constraint Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07491)
*Clotilde Brayé,Aurélien Bricout,Arnaud Gotlieb,Nadjib Lazaar,Quentin Vallet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了医疗智能系统(MIS)中基于可信AI伦理要求的风险降低优化问题，提出了三种求解方法(MIP、SAT、CP)并进行了比较分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医疗智能系统在医疗工作流程中的广泛应用，虽然带来了显著效益，但也引发了关键的安全和伦理问题。根据欧盟AI法案，大多数MIS将被归类为高风险系统，需要正式的风险管理流程来确保符合可信AI的伦理要求。

Method: 将风险降低优化问题形式化为约束优化任务，研究了三种求解范式：混合整数规划(MIP)、可满足性(SAT)和约束规划(CP)。使用Minizinc约束建模语言进行建模，并进行了比较实验研究。

Result: 通过实验研究分析了每种方法的性能、表达能力和可扩展性，识别了方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 从方法论的限制出发，提出了将Minizinc模型集成到完整可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的工作展望。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trust- worthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Pro- gramming(CP).Our contributions
include the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling
with the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental
study that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each
ap- proach to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw
some perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model
into a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

### [11] [CompassLLM: A Multi-Agent Approach toward Geo-Spatial Reasoning for Popular Path Query](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07516)
*Md. Nazmul Islam Ananto,Shamit Fatin,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于解决轨迹数据中的热门路径查询问题，通过搜索和生成两阶段流程实现高效路径发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法和机器学习方法在热门路径查询中需要模型训练、参数调优和重新训练，而大语言模型在空间和图形推理方面展现出强大能力，因此探索如何将其应用于地理空间问题具有重要意义。

Method: CompassLLM采用多智能体框架，包含两阶段流程：SEARCH阶段识别热门路径，GENERATE阶段在历史轨迹数据中不存在路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出卓越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，同时成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将大语言模型的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为热门路径查询提供了一种无需模型训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

### [12] [Measuring and Mitigating Identity Bias in Multi-Agent Debate via Anonymization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07517)
*Hyeong Kyu Choi,Xiaojin Zhu,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in
https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.

Conclusion: RECAP为合规应用中的PII检测提供了一个可扩展且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware
large language models (LLMs) for scalable PII detection across 13 low-resource
locales. RECAP's modular design supports over 300 entity types without
retraining, using a three-phase refinement pipeline for disambiguation and
filtering. Benchmarked with nervaluate, our system outperforms fine-tuned NER
models by 82% and zero-shot LLMs by 17% in weighted F1-score. This work offers
a scalable and adaptable solution for efficient PII detection in
compliance-focused applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出AI评估领域存在严重问题，需要建立统一、实时、质量可控的基准测试框架PeerBench，通过密封执行、题库轮换和延迟透明等机制来确保评估的公正性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI评估存在数据污染、选择性报告、质量控制不足等问题，导致难以区分真实进展与夸大宣传，削弱了科学信号和公众信任，亟需建立可信的评估体系。

Method: 提出PeerBench框架，采用社区治理的监督评估模式，包含密封执行、题库银行与滚动更新、延迟透明度等核心机制。

Result: 构建了一个能够系统性解决当前评估缺陷的蓝图，为建立真正可信的AI进展衡量标准奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 当前的自由放任评估方法不可持续，必须转向构建性稳健的基准测试框架，PeerBench为实现这一范式转变提供了具体路径，有望恢复AI评估的完整性。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级即插即用的澄清模块，通过插入必要问题来阻止多智能体系统中消息传递的错误传播，显著提升准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统通过协作分工有望增强问题解决能力，但由于边缘级错误级联（一个消息传递中的小错误会传播到整个链中），其表现经常不如单智能体基线。

Method: AgentAsk采用三阶段流程：(i)从整理的失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略，(ii)监督策略决定何时/问什么/问谁/如何问，(iii)使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编码基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提高公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持最小开销，延迟和额外成本均低于5%，接近强评估器的性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，本文贡献了边缘级错误的分类原则和链路局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 提出一种可追踪和可归责的序列多智能体系统，通过明确角色、结构化交接和记录保存来提升LLM多智能体系统的可靠性和可调试性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的序列多智能体系统虽然能自动化复杂软件任务，但由于错误会在各阶段间静默传递而难以信任，需要建立可追踪和可归责的机制。

Method: 采用Planner -> Executor -> Critic流水线架构，评估8种配置的三种先进LLM在三个基准测试上的表现，分析错误起源、传播和修复方式。

Result: 结构化可归责的智能体间交接显著提高准确性并防止简单流水线中的常见失败；不同模型在特定角色上有明确优势和风险；准确率-成本-延迟权衡是任务依赖的，异构流水线通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的数据驱动方法，用于设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测和可归责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI模型在组合推理基准上表现不佳，但研究发现这是由于评估指标的系统性低估，而非模型能力不足。

Method: 引入组匹配分数来更好利用组结构，并提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法，这是一种无需外部监督的迭代自改进方法。

Result: 方法显著提升了模型性能：SigLIP-B16超越GPT-4.1，在Winoground上首次超过人类估计性能，在16个数据集变体上均获得一致改进。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估方法和引入TTM算法，可以揭示和提升AI模型的隐藏组合推理能力，推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实推荐系统中新物品频繁添加，现有离策略学习方法在新物品存在时可能不安全，需要开发能保证安全性的探索框架

Method: 首先开发Safe OPG方法，基于高置信度离策略评估；然后提出DEPLOY框架，利用安全裕度并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；DEPLOY框架能在保证安全的同时有效探索新物品

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够在保证推荐系统安全实施的同时，有效探索新物品，解决了安全性和探索之间的权衡问题

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个可复现的仿真框架来评估多模态环境中生成式代理的安全性、连贯性和信任度，发现当前代理在检测直接多模态矛盾方面表现良好，但在全局安全对齐方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言和视觉语言模型使代理能够在丰富环境中自主行动并追求目标，但它们在跨模态安全性、连贯性和信任推理方面的能力仍然有限，需要系统评估。

Method: 引入可复现的仿真框架，配备分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知能力，并使用SocialMetrics行为指标套件量化计划修订、不安全到安全的转换以及网络信息扩散。

Result: 代理在纠正不安全计划方面仅达到55%成功率；三种模型（Claude、GPT-4o mini、Qwen-VL）的平均不安全到安全转换率分别为75%、55%和58%；45%的不安全行动在误导性视觉信息下被接受。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全性方面存在关键限制，代理倾向于过度信任图像，需要改进全局安全对齐能力。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有STL引导的RL方法使用全局评估的稀疏奖励，可能导致训练不收敛和不稳定，需要更准确的局部奖励累积机制。

Method: 在每一步控制中持续监控系统行为与STL规范的符合程度，计算满足或违反的量化距离，并提供了因果语义的平滑近似以支持深度RL方法。

Conclusion: 基于在线因果语义的STL引导RL方法能够有效解决稀疏奖励问题，提升强化学习的训练稳定性和效率。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在化学任务中表现出潜力，但尚不清楚其是否具备真正的化学推理能力，包括生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性和遵循逻辑连贯的多步路径。

Method: 构建oMeBench基准数据集，包含10,000+标注的机理步骤；提出oMeS动态评估框架，结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性；分析最先进LLM性能，并探索提示策略和微调方法。

Result: 当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步推理方面存在困难；使用提示策略和在数据集上微调专家模型，性能比领先闭源模型提高50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供了严谨基础，当前模型在化学推理方面仍有显著提升空间。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成综述的方法通常直接提取和总结论文内容，但忽略了论文间的结构关系，导致生成的综述缺乏连贯的分类体系和深层上下文理解。

Method: 构建三层分层引用图（基础层、发展层、前沿层），结合层内水平搜索和跨层垂直遍历，通过多智能体验证确保一致性、覆盖率和事实准确性。

Result: 实验表明SurveyG在人类专家和LLM评估中均优于现有方法，生成的综述更全面且更好地符合领域知识分类体系。

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合结构化和上下文知识，显著提升了LLM生成综述的质量和结构连贯性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在医疗领域容易产生事实和逻辑错误的问题，因为医疗领域是高风险领域，错误是不可接受的。

Method: 递归分解复杂医疗任务为原子步骤，自动审核推理链的逻辑一致性和证据可追溯性，采用"引导"模式存储已验证推理链作为"定理"，后续任务使用RAG进行高效解决。

Result: 在四个医疗管理领域验证，错误检测率超过98%，误报率低于1%，显著优于基线LLMs，RAG模式预计可降低85%的处理成本。

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是创建可信赖、透明且成本效益高的AI系统的重要一步，使LLM技术在医疗关键应用中可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GRAIL通过将TT-GDA重新定义为生成式图恢复问题，成功实现了无需源域数据的图域自适应，展示了LLM在图恢复任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

Conclusion: ACONIC框架通过系统性分解方法有效解决了LLM在复杂任务上的可靠性问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在明显缺陷：模型生成响应的上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全对或全错样本中获取知识。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上取得优异结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO方法能够充分利用每个样本提高训练效率，并让模型在训练过程中模仿参考答案的解题策略，从而增强推理的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 对抗环境中存在信息获取与暴露风险的关键权衡：通信能增强态势感知，但会暴露自身位置增加被攻击风险。

Method: 提出PEEC博弈框架，使用SHADOW多头部序贯强化学习框架，集成连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手行为预测建模。

Result: SHADOW追捕者相比六个竞争基线获得更高成功率，消融研究确认时序建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要。

Conclusion: 学习到的策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

Conclusion: LLM有潜力实现可扩展、自适应和协同的城市范围交通导航，为复杂城市环境中的智能大规模车辆路由提供基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our

TL;DR: Augur是一个完全由LLM驱动的时序预测框架，利用LLM的因果推理能力发现和使用协变量间的有向因果关联，通过师生架构提升预测精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的时序预测方法存在架构边缘化、依赖粗糙统计文本提示和缺乏可解释性等局限，需要开发更有效的LLM驱动框架。

Method: 采用两阶段师生架构：教师LLM通过启发式搜索和成对因果检验从时序数据推断有向因果图；学生代理精炼图结构并在高置信度因果关联上进行微调，将其编码为丰富文本提示进行预测。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上与25个基线方法对比，Augur实现了竞争性性能和强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Augur框架通过LLM因果推理显著提升了时序预测的准确性和可解释性，证明了完全LLM驱动方法的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval框架填补了DeepResearch系统评估的空白，为系统性能比较和能力发展提供了标准化工具。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

Method: 结合以人为中心的AI透明度方法和系统技术系统视角，发展公民AI系统的有意义透明度概念。

Result: 开发了有意义透明度的概念框架，强调透明度应使公众能够参与影响其生活的AI系统。

Conclusion: 有意义透明度是解决AI系统偏见和减少公民及公职人员代理权问题的关键，需要超越单纯技术透明度，连接理解与行动能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Method: 提出FactFin框架，包含策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟器四个核心组件，通过反事实扰动强制模型学习因果驱动因素。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有基线中表现最佳，在样本外泛化方面具有优越的风险调整后性能。

Conclusion: FactFin框架有效缓解了LLM金融代理的信息泄露问题，提升了模型的因果学习能力和实际泛化性能。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的AI代理在个性化交互方面存在局限，检索增强生成虽然提升了上下文感知，但缺乏结合上下文信息和用户特定数据的机制。

Method: 基于统一个性化定义推导技术需求，结合多代理协作和多源检索等成熟AI模式，构建集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上评估，指标包括检索准确率、响应正确性和BertScore。5天试点用户研究提供了用户对感知个性化的初步反馈。

Conclusion: 研究为未来工作提供指导，突显了集成持久记忆和用户档案在提升基于LLM代理的适应性和感知个性化方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练范式（SFT、DPO、RLVR）在长尾查询泛化、细粒度监督和逻辑一致性方面存在局限，需要更有效的推理对齐方法。

Method: 提出步进式奖励策略优化（SRPO）算法，结合生成式步进奖励模型和人工标注验证器，采用多样化数据过滤和多阶段课程学习。

Result: 在真实搜索基准测试中，TaoSR-SHE在推理质量和相关性预测准确性方面均优于SFT、DPO、GRPO等基线方法。

Conclusion: TaoSR-SHE框架显著提升了电商搜索相关性分析的性能、可解释性和鲁棒性，为复杂推理场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理过于强调自主操作，忽视了用户在任务执行中的主动参与，导致在模糊、动态变化和冲突的任务场景中适应性不足

Method: 集成三个专门代理围绕共享内存模块：信息管理代理用于基于槽位的信息管理和主动用户交互，决策代理用于冲突感知规划，反思代理用于任务反思和信息一致性验证

Result: 在涉及信息困境的复杂任务中，ReInAgent比Mobile-Agent-v2实现了25%更高的成功率，有效解决信息困境并产生更符合用户偏好的结果

Conclusion: 通过持续上下文信息分析和持续的用户-代理协作，ReInAgent克服了现有方法依赖清晰静态任务假设的局限性，在复杂现实场景中实现更自适应和可靠的移动任务导航

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

Motivation: 探究语言模型是否真正将连续值建模为连续，以及评估数值嵌入空间的质量特性。

Method: 使用线性重建和主成分分析评估三个主要提供商（OpenAI、Google Gemini、Voyage AI）的语言模型嵌入空间特性。

Result: 虽然重建保真度高（R²≥0.95），但主成分仅解释少量变异，表明许多嵌入组件与简单数值输入空间正交，且精度增加时线性重建和解释方差都会恶化。

Conclusion: 语言模型数值表示存在非连续性和噪声问题，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号值的应用领域有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型生成的推理过程往往过长且包含冗余步骤，增加了推理成本并降低了可用性。如何在保持准确性的同时控制响应长度是一个未解决的挑战。

Method: 提出PEAR奖励机制，在思考阶段惩罚过高熵值以鼓励简洁推理，在最终答案阶段允许适度探索，从而实现自适应长度控制。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时保持各模型规模的竞争性准确率，并展现出良好的分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEAR通过阶段依赖的熵控制，有效平衡了推理的简洁性和性能，为大推理模型的实用部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: AILoRA是一种参数高效微调方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验来改进LoRA，针对自注意力机制中W^Q和W^V矩阵的不同功能特性进行差异化初始化，提升微调性能和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然被广泛采用，但仍面临性能次优和收敛慢的问题。研究发现W^Q和W^V矩阵具有不同的参数特性：W^Q对下游任务变化敏感，而W^V的特征表示跨任务稳定。

Method: 提出函数感知非对称低秩先验，对W^Q注入主成分以保留任务适应能力，对W^V注入次要成分以保持通用特征表示，实现差异化初始化策略。

Result: AILoRA能够更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业化角色，从而提升微调性能和收敛效率。

Conclusion: 通过考虑自注意力机制中不同投影矩阵的功能差异，AILoRA有效解决了LoRA的局限性，为参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的场景生成方法难以平衡命令遵循准确性与真实世界驾驶环境的真实性，常常为了降低场景描述复杂度而牺牲真实性，将场景限制在2D或开放循环模拟中。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，包含反馈校准模块来细化生成精度，通过自然语言与闭环交互模拟之间的桥梁，约束对抗性车辆行为。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的具有不同关键性程度的场景（危险描述ACT：0.072秒 vs 安全描述：3.532秒；舒适度：0.654 vs 0.764），其细化模块有效降低了初始输出中的过度攻击性，碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim框架能够创建高保真场景，增强安全测试和训练，通过自然语言到闭环交互模拟的转换，更好地匹配用户意图。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MCCS算法，将保形选择扩展到多条件场景，通过区域单调性非保形分数和全局BH程序实现FDR控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物发现、精准医学等资源受限应用中，需要从大规模数据集中选择高质量候选者。现有保形选择方法仅适用于单阈值场景，无法满足多条件选择的实际需求。

Method: 提出MCCS算法，为合取条件引入具有区域单调性的非保形分数，为析取条件使用全局Benjamini-Hochberg程序。

Result: 实验验证MCCS优于基线方法，在不同条件组合、现实模态和多任务场景中具有良好泛化性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: MCCS能够在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AutoQual框架，使用LLM代理自动发现可解释特征来评估在线评论质量，在大型电商平台上验证有效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖手工特征难以跨领域扩展，深度学习模型缺乏可解释性且可能过度关注语义而非质量

Method: AutoQual框架模拟人类研究过程，通过反思生成特征假设，自主工具实现操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验

Result: 在亿级用户平台的大规模A/B测试中，平均用户查看评论数增加0.79%，评论读者转化率提升0.27%

Conclusion: AutoQual成功将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性可计算特征，为质量评估提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统移除敏感信息及其代理来克服当前偏见缓解方法的局限性，使用本体工程和最优传输确保完全公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏见缓解方法存在局限性，需要一种能够系统移除敏感信息及其代理的数学基础方法，确保AI系统的完全公平性。

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程形式化定义敏感属性，通过逻辑推理推断代理，构建捕获偏见模式的sigma代数G，然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输生成与G独立的公平表示。

Result: 该方法能够保证真正的独立性而非简单的去相关，在贷款审批等任务中确保完全公平，其中ZIP代码等代理会揭示种族信息。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可认证且数学基础的方法，用于构建可信赖的AI系统，确保公平性。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地集成到AI驱动的决策支持系统中，理解它们的风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要。需要防止系统无意中将用户推向风险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见。

Method: 研究通过多样化经济场景，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险厌恶的可操纵性，来检验语言模型复制人类风险偏好的能力。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型显示出与人类行为的一定一致性，但存在显著差异，表明需要改进生物中心的可操纵性度量方法。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁进一步改进模型设计，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提高在风险管理环境中的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过解耦知识检索和响应生成来解决对话AI中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在保持响应质量的同时大幅降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放域对话AI系统中延迟与质量的固有矛盾：轻量级模型延迟低但缺乏推理深度，而工具增强的ReAct代理虽然事实准确性高但同步执行导致检索过程中交互阻塞。

Method: 采用时间解耦框架，包含三个协调组件：知识充分性评估器（实时评估）、轻量级响应生成器（即时交互）、异步知识精炼代理（后台知识增强），通过智能触发机制实现连续对话流和渐进式知识覆盖。

Result: 在Top-iOCQA上的评估显示，PMFR相比暴力扩展方法实现了95.3%的延迟降低（23.38秒→1.09秒），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C：0.613 vs 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过异步知识编排框架成功解决了对话AI中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在显著降低延迟的同时保持了响应质量，为实时对话系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during re- trieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a tempo- ral
decoupling framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through
asynchronous knowledge orchestra- tion. PMFR employs three coordinated
components: (1) a Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency
assessment, (2) a Lightweight Response Generator for imme- diate user
interaction, and (3) an Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background
knowledge enhancement. This architecture maintains continuous conversational
flow while progressively enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent
triggering mechanisms. Evaluation results on Top- iOCQA demonstrate PMFR
outperforms brute-force scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s
-> 1.09s) while preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight
synchronous baselines (GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

TL;DR: 提出了R-HORIZON方法来评估和增强大型推理模型的长视野推理能力，通过查询组合构建复杂多步推理任务，发现现有模型存在推理长度限制和思考预算分配问题，并通过强化学习验证奖励显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，无法充分评估模型理解和响应复杂长视野场景的能力，需要更全面的评估方法来测试大型推理模型的长期推理能力。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激长视野推理行为，构建包含相互依赖问题的复杂多步推理任务的长视野推理基准，并使用该基准数据通过验证奖励的强化学习来训练模型。

Result: 评估发现即使最先进的推理模型在长视野任务中性能显著下降，模型存在有效推理长度限制和思考预算分配不当问题。使用R-HORIZON数据训练的RLVR模型在多项推理任务上表现提升，AIME2024准确率提高7.5分。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估LRMs的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式，能够有效提升模型在复杂多步推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统的开发和治理集中在少数公司和国家手中，可能导致技术编码狭隘利益并限制公共机构。现有基准主要关注语言、视觉和编码能力，缺乏可审计的多元治理衡量标准。

Method: 开发了AIPI测量模型，通过可复现的流程整合结构化网络和存储库分析、外部评估和专家访谈，从公共工件和独立评估中编码可验证实践，明确处理"未知"证据。

Result: 建立了包含协议、代码本、评分脚本和证据图的开放维护系统，报告了试点供应商结果，并与相邻的透明度、安全和治理框架进行了比较。

Conclusion: AIPI旨在引导激励机制向多元实践发展，为政策制定者、采购者和公众提供可比较的证据，促进AI系统的多元治理。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为锦标赛树方法(TTM)的新框架，只需m-1次成对比较即可获得完整、互反且一致的比较矩阵，解决了传统方法的高认知负担和不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对比较方法需要m(m-1)/2次比较，认知负担高且存在不一致风险，计算复杂度也高。需要一种更高效且保证一致性的方法。

Method: TTM方法包含三个阶段：(i)使用减少的目标比较集获取专家判断，(ii)构建一致的成对比较矩阵，(iii)从结果矩阵推导全局价值尺度。该方法将偏好建模维度从m(m-1)/2减少到m个参数。

Result: TTM方法通过设计确保一致性，最小化认知努力，并与经典卡片法兼容，能够处理区间和比率尺度。开发了基于Web的工具展示其实际应用性。

Conclusion: 锦标赛树方法提供了一种高效、一致且实用的多准则决策支持框架，显著改善了传统成对比较方法的局限性。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过自主干预学习因果结构的方法有效，DODO算法在因果图推断方面表现优异

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

Conclusion: 从因果视角将推理任务建模为选择机制，并通过SR²框架学习潜在变量间的密集依赖关系，能够有效提升模型的推理能力，为推理任务的挑战提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其安全性和鲁棒性引发严重担忧，需要揭示其安全漏洞。

Method: 使用有序触发序列，从初始触发开始，后续触发从环境中提取，实现多步操控，使智能体偏离预期任务。

Conclusion: CoTri实现了对智能体的稳定多步控制，同时增强了其固有鲁棒性和任务能力，使攻击更加隐蔽，带来潜在安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

*Liwei Kang,Yue Deng,Yao Xiao,Zhanfeng Mo,Wee Sun Lee,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了大型语言模型在数学推理中的反思行为，发现反思主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案。训练更多反思步骤主要提升首次回答正确率，而非通过反思修正错误的能力。作者提出动态截断反思的方法，在保持精度的同时显著减少推理token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在推理能力上取得显著进步，但反思行为对性能提升的具体贡献尚不明确。作者旨在系统分析反思在推理过程中的实际作用，并探索如何优化推理效率。

Method: 系统分析了8个推理模型在5个数学数据集上的推理过程，重点关注模型生成答案后的反思行为。构建了不同反思步数的监督微调数据集，并提出基于问题感知的早期停止方法和动态截断反思策略。

Result: 反思行为主要是确认性的，很少改变模型的初始答案。训练更多反思步骤主要提升首次回答正确率。动态截断反思方法在5个数学数据集上减少24.5%的推理token，精度仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 反思在推理过程中主要起确认作用而非修正作用。通过动态截断不必要的反思步骤可以显著提高推理效率，在保持精度的同时大幅减少计算资源消耗。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

*Marius Dragoi,Ioana Pintilie,Florin Gogianu,Florin Brad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Cover@tau指标来替代Pass@k，用于更准确地评估语言模型在推理任务中的真实能力边界，避免随机猜测带来的误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用Pass@k评估RLVR模型时存在交叉现象：RLVR模型在小k值下表现更好，但基础模型在大k值下反而更优。这被解释为基础模型有更大的推理边界，但作者认为在离散答案空间中，大k值下的Pass@k反映的是多次尝试的成功概率而非真实推理能力。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，衡量模型至少能产生tau比例正确补全的问题比例。该指标通过显式可靠性阈值来捕捉推理能力，随机猜测的模型在tau增加时会迅速退化。

Result: 使用Cover@tau指标评估多个RLVR模型，发现与Pass@1相比，流行算法的相对排名发生了变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau能够更准确地评估语言模型的真实推理能力边界，避免Pass@k在大采样预算下因随机猜测而产生的误导性结果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

TL;DR: 提出语义相似度评分(SSR)方法，使用LLMs生成文本响应并通过嵌入相似度映射到Likert分布，解决传统消费者研究中的面板偏差和规模限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消费者研究成本高昂且存在面板偏差和规模限制，LLMs提供替代方案但直接询问数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: SSR方法：从LLMs获取文本响应，通过嵌入相似度将这些响应映射到参考陈述的Likert分布。

Result: 在57个个人护理产品调查数据集上测试，SSR达到90%的人类重测信度，保持现实的响应分布(KS相似度>0.85)，并提供丰富的定性反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了可扩展的消费者研究模拟，同时保留了传统调查指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出QAgent，一个统一的代理式检索增强生成框架，通过搜索代理进行自适应检索，优化查询理解，提升LLM在知识密集型任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG在复杂查询理解方面存在困难，基于强化学习的搜索代理虽然前景广阔但仍面临泛化和部署挑战。

Method: 采用模块化搜索代理进行查询理解，通过多步决策过程训练，使用强化学习最大化检索质量，支持准确的下游答案生成。

Result: 实验表明QAgent在问答任务中表现出色，可作为即插即用模块用于实际部署。

Conclusion: QAgent通过专注于有效检索的策略，增强了LLM应用的泛化能力，解决了传统RAG和RL搜索代理的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 检测大型语言模型中的幻觉对其可信部署至关重要，现有基于不确定性的检测框架存在局限，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 通过测量多个模型输出和不同层隐藏状态的有效秩来量化不确定性，基于表示谱分析提供可解释的语义变化洞察。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法能有效检测幻觉，并在各种场景中稳健泛化。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM真实性检测提供了新范式，结合了理论优雅性和实践效率。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

Method: 采用轻量级解码器架构，包含：(1) 基于token的动态门控机制，(2) 特征调制和通道注意力，(3) 辅助对比学习目标进行视觉接地

Result: 在五个基准测试(BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground、VQA)上表现出与多模态基线相当或更优的性能，动态门控发现可解释模式

Conclusion: 动态门控是高效多模态学习的强大工具，即使在严格约束下也能提供可解释性和性能

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AutoML和Kaggle竞赛等机器学习工程场景中，现有LLM缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，传统搜索方法限制了知识传递和搜索空间多样性，无法有效利用历史轨迹和跨分支信息共享。

Method: 提出AutoMLGen系统，集成领域知识库提供高质量先验指导，采用蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS）实现动态路径重组、历史轨迹重用和多解决方案融合，结合细粒度操作符集提高稳定性和收敛速度。

Result: 在MLE-Bench评估中，AutoMLGen在12小时预算（标准运行时间的一半）下，在平均奖牌率和有效提交率等多个维度实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过结合领域知识库和图搜索策略，有效解决了机器学习工程任务中的挑战，展示了在有限预算下实现高性能的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多任务需要模型在多轮交互中策略性地收集相关信息，但现有模型缺乏何时停止收集信息并做出决策的能力，容易导致过度思考或偏离目标。

Method: CaRT使用反事实轨迹对进行微调：一个轨迹在适当时候终止，另一个经过最小修改后不应终止。通过语言推理训练LLM解释终止决策的合理性。

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率。

Conclusion: CaRT方法能够有效教导LLMs何时停止寻求信息，通过反事实推理和语言解释提升了模型在策略性信息收集任务中的性能。

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Conclusion: 通过选择性更新特定层，可以有效平衡新技能学习和已有能力保持，为大型多模态模型的持续学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

Conclusion: 理论解释了为什么长度归一化等实用启发式方法能提高稳定性，并表明固定学习率下成功率可能停滞在100%以下，这些预测通过受控老虎机模拟和LLM实验得到验证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple
binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant
empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been
lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its
training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.
Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes
the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the
response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the
update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size
threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning
converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts
how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success
rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization
improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success
rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through
controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training
Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习模型存在两个关键问题：不同数据模态学习不均衡导致模型偏向某些模态；模型可能偏向某些人口群体导致不公平性能。这两个方面相互影响，造成不平衡且不公平的多模态学习。

Method: 提出MultiFair方法，采用双重梯度调制过程，在数据模态和群体层面动态调制训练梯度的优化方向和幅度。

Result: 在两个多模态医疗数据集上的实验表明，MultiFair优于最先进的多模态学习和公平性学习方法。

Conclusion: MultiFair能有效解决多模态医疗分类中的模态偏差和群体不公平问题，提升模型性能的公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

*Aditya Chakravarty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 评估GNN-RNN和MMST-ViT模型在真实OOD条件下的作物产量预测性能，发现GNN-RNN在跨区域泛化方面表现更优，而模型复杂度不是泛化能力的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化对农业系统造成严重影响，需要准确的作物产量预测来保障粮食安全。虽然深度学习模型在产量预测方面显示出潜力，但其在跨地理区域和年份的泛化能力尚未得到充分测试。

Method: 使用覆盖1,200+美国县区的CropNet数据集，通过跨七个USDA农业资源区域的留一簇交叉验证和年度预测场景，对GNN-RNN和MMST-ViT两种最先进模型进行基准测试。

Result: GNN-RNN在地理转移下表现出更好的泛化能力，而MMST-ViT在域内表现良好但在OOD条件下性能急剧下降。Heartland和Northern Great Plains区域转移稳定性较好，而Prairie Gateway区域在所有模型和作物中表现持续不佳。GNN-RNN的训练速度比MMST-ViT快135倍。

Conclusion: 时空对齐而非模型复杂度或数据规模是稳健泛化的关键，需要透明的OOD评估协议来确保公平可靠的气候感知农业预测。

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种生成高质量CUDA内核的管道，构建了ConCuR数据集和KernelCoder模型，在KernelBench上显著优于现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GPU内核生成中高质量数据稀缺的问题，因为大多数高质量内核是专有且不开源的，这阻碍了使用监督微调来对齐LLM到内核生成任务。

Method: 开发了一个生成和筛选高质量CUDA内核及其推理轨迹的管道，构建ConCuR数据集，并训练KernelCoder模型。

Result: 在KernelBench设置中，模型显著优于现有最佳模型QwQ-32B，超越了所有开源内核生成微调模型以及前沿模型如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。

Conclusion: 平均推理长度可作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标，所提出的观察、指标和数据收集管道有助于未来获得更好的内核生成数据。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

TL;DR: ETD方法通过在推理时迭代特定层来增强大语言模型的推理能力，无需改变模型架构或参数数量，在多个推理基准上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提升LLM推理能力的方法通常需要增加参数量、训练数据或推理计算量，而研究表明推理所需的关键计算集中在有限层中。

Method: ETD方法在中期训练阶段训练基础模型在推理相关层上进行迭代，推理时在这些选定层上迭代计算，并探索自适应深度策略。

Result: 在17个推理基准上取得显著提升，OLMo-2 1B模型在GSM8K上相对准确率提升28.4%，在MATH上提升36%。

Conclusion: 递归潜在推理为增强LLM推理能力提供了一条简单有效的路径。

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 研究线性上下文赌博机中的付费观测问题，学习者在每轮选择动作以最小化给定上下文中的损失，并可决定支付固定成本来观测任何臂的损失。

Method: 基于Follow-the-Regularized-Leader框架，通过矩阵几何重采样构建高效估计器，设计计算高效的Best-of-Both-Worlds算法。

Result: 算法在对抗性设置下达到最小最大最优遗憾Θ(T^{2/3})，在（被污染的）随机机制下保证多对数遗憾。

Conclusion: 该方法基于BOBWhardproblems框架，为"困难问题"设计BOBW算法，使用针对所考虑设置的分析技术。

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaRP是一种基于偏好调整的在线路由方法，通过上下文多臂老虎机框架在训练时模拟部署环境的部分反馈，实现无需重新训练即可在推理时调整性能/成本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由系统大多依赖离线训练，需要所有候选模型的完整标签，这在部署环境中不现实，因为只能观察到所选模型的结果。需要一种能在部分反馈条件下训练并支持偏好可调推理的方法。

Method: 将LLM路由建模为基于提示特征和用户偏好向量的上下文多臂老虎机问题，在训练时模拟在线反馈环境，使路由决策适应每个新提示而不是依赖完整的离线监督。

Result: 实验表明该方法比强离线路由器性能提升至少12.46%，比最大LLM性能提升至少2.45%，并能稳健泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: BaRP方法成功解决了LLM路由中的在线决策问题，在部分反馈条件下训练的同时支持测试时的偏好调整，实现了更好的性能-成本权衡。

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习中的时序差分学习算法需要依赖未知问题参数才能达到最优收敛率，这限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用双时间尺度的联邦时序差分学习结合Polyak-Ruppert平均方法，构建参数无关的算法框架。

Result: 算法在平均奖励和折扣奖励设置下均能证明达到最优收敛率O~(1/NT)，其中N为智能体数量，T为迭代次数。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了联邦学习中时序差分学习在马尔可夫数据下的理论空白，为异构环境下的联邦强化学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

TL;DR: MoGU是一个用于回归任务和时间序列预测的混合专家框架，通过高斯分布建模专家输出，并使用基于不确定性的门控机制来量化预测的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE方法只提供点估计，无法量化预测的不确定性。MoGU旨在解决这一问题，为时间序列预测提供既准确又可靠的预测区间。

Method: 将每个专家的输出建模为高斯分布，用专家估计的方差替代传统的基于输入的门控网络，通过不确定性来决定各专家对最终预测的贡献。

Result: 在多个时间序列预测基准测试中，MoGU始终优于单专家模型和传统MoE设置，并提供与预测误差直接相关的良好量化不确定性。

Conclusion: MoGU框架在保持预测准确性的同时，有效量化了预测不确定性，提高了时间序列预测的可靠性。

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上达到与MCMC方法相当的稳定性能，但所需时间显著减少

Conclusion: metabeta为贝叶斯混合效应回归提供了一种高效替代方案，在保持性能的同时大幅提升计算效率

Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in
empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用张量补全作为替代模型来加速材料设计，特别是在训练数据来自非均匀随机采样的场景下，相比传统机器学习方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料设计过程中，随着设计变量的增加，搜索空间呈指数级增长，使得合成和验证每个材料的性能变得不切实际且耗时。特别是在训练数据来自非均匀随机采样（如实验者因便利性而更频繁合成某些材料）的情况下，传统机器学习方法表现不佳。

Method: 使用张量补全作为替代模型来加速材料设计，特别针对搜索空间存在偏差采样的场景。

Result: 在存在偏差采样的搜索空间中，张量补全方法优于经典机器学习方法（如高斯过程和XGBoost），R²提高了约5%。在均匀随机采样的整个搜索空间中，张量补全仍能提供可比较的性能。

Conclusion: 张量补全是一种有效的替代模型，特别适用于训练数据来自非均匀随机采样的材料设计场景，能够显著加速最优晶格结构的设计过程。

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

Motivation: 在实际应用中，检测机器生成文本面临两个挑战：评分模型可能与未知源模型不匹配，以及每个输入的对比生成成本高昂。

Method: SurpMark将surprisals量化为可解释的状态，估计测试文本的状态转移矩阵，并通过广义Jensen-Shannon差距将其与预先构建的人类和机器参考进行比较。

Conclusion: SurpMark提供了一种有效的黑盒检测方法，能够在实际约束下可靠地检测机器生成的文本。

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak
executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a
memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)
there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)
attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the
system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness
of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

Conclusion: 多模态协同训练作为一种结构化方法，在开发数据高效且鲁棒的AI系统方面具有实际优势，能够有效提升在动态真实环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLLM4TS是一个新颖的多模态时间序列分析框架，通过将时间序列数据转换为视觉表示，利用多模态大语言模型进行通用时间序列分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据分析面临复杂的时间依赖性和跨通道交互挑战，受人类分析师视觉检查时间序列模式的启发，探索视觉表示是否能增强自动化时间序列分析。

Method: 将每个时间序列通道渲染为水平堆叠的彩色线图，使用时间感知视觉块对齐策略将视觉块与对应时间段对齐，融合数值数据的细粒度时间细节和视觉表示的全局上下文信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MLLM4TS在预测任务（如分类）和生成任务（如异常检测和预测）中都表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了将视觉模态与预训练语言模型整合以实现稳健和可泛化时间序列分析的潜力。

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

TL;DR: 提出基于小波变换的自动睡眠分期框架，使用时频分析捕捉睡眠相关频段的瞬态和振荡模式，结合集成学习达到88.37%的准确率，优于传统机器学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的睡眠分期对睡眠障碍诊断至关重要，传统方法依赖人工标注或时频域特征提取，需要更自动化和准确的方法。

Method: 使用连续小波变换(CWT)生成时频图，捕捉睡眠相关频段的瞬态和振荡模式，结合集成学习方法进行睡眠分期。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF扩展数据库上达到88.37%的总体准确率和73.15的宏平均F1分数，优于传统机器学习方法，与近期深度学习方法性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: 小波分析为稳健、可解释且临床适用的睡眠分期分类提供了潜力。

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,
and clinically applicable sleep stage classification.

TL;DR: 提出FairSpecTemp方法，从图平稳节点观测中估计公平图，确保连接不偏向敏感属性。该方法包含两个变体：一个直接约束偏差，另一个通过限制图谱偏差来隐式鼓励公平估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图中的边往往表现出对某些群体对的连接偏好，这种有偏连接会加剧甚至诱导下游图任务的歧视性处理。

Method: 提出FairSpecTemp方法，基于优化的图公平估计方法，包含两个变体：一个利用图平稳性的交换性质直接约束偏差，另一个通过限制图谱偏差来隐式鼓励公平估计。

Result: 方法具有高概率性能边界，在公平性和准确性之间形成条件权衡，分析表明恢复公平图无需牺牲准确性。在合成和真实数据集上的评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FairSpecTemp能够有效估计公平图，两个变体各有优势，为图公平性研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of
FairSpecTemp.

Conclusion: 该方法能够构建紧凑的动力学系统来演化感兴趣量，无需底层流场的显式知识，实现准确的长时期预测和计算效率提升。

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

Result: 获得了丰富的渐近相图，包含五种不同的非退化相；发现dropout的惩罚效应仅在O(1/宽度)量级的极小学习率下存在；在较大学习率下，dropout等效于随机几何技术；极限动力学由均值场跳跃过程描述。

Conclusion: 研究结果为重新理解大规模神经网络中dropout的作用提供了理论基础，揭示了学习率对dropout效应的重要影响，并为后续研究奠定了框架。

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance
maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our
findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for
improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

Abstract: In this work, we present LOTUS (Learning to Learn with Optimal Transport for
Unsupervised Scenarios), a simple yet effective method to perform model
selection for multiple unsupervised machine learning(ML) tasks such as outlier
detection and clustering. Our intuition behind this work is that a machine
learning pipeline will perform well in a new dataset if it previously worked
well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for
multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

Conclusion: 基于扩散的生成方法为符号回归提供了新的研究机会，在相似底层架构下能够提供与自回归生成相当甚至改进的性能

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based
symbolic regression.

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory

characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures
in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an
emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out
valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the
importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in
broader and more complex scenarios.

Motivation: 当前LLM的环境交互必须通过文本格式进行，这使语言模型同时承担推理和控制职责，且需要外部解析器。作者希望将环境交互内部化，减少语言负担。

Method: 提出ExpA框架，允许模型在语言环境和外部环境之间路由切换；引入EARL强化学习算法，使用反事实策略优化来促进扩展动作空间的探索。

Result: 在需要多轮交互和条件规划的任务上，EARL优于词汇约束动作的基线方法；在计算器多任务学习中表现稳健；在部分可观测排序问题中实现100%的Sort-4准确率，并自主发现与经典设计相竞争的高效算法。

Conclusion: 通过将环境交互内部化到扩展动作空间，并配合EARL强化学习，能够显著提升LLM在复杂交互任务中的性能，实现更高效的环境探索和算法发现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

Conclusion: TGM填补了时序图机器学习基础设施的空白，通过统一框架显著提升了效率，并为先前难以研究的问题打开了大门。

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using
onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track
assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains
a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the
scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses
these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

*Muhammad Usman,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGTEN是一个用于动态图信任评估的深度学习框架，通过高斯分布表示节点和边的不确定性，结合时间建模和对抗防御机制，在比特币信任网络中显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型动态图中的信任评估需要能够捕捉变化关系、表达校准置信度并抵抗对抗性攻击的模型。现有方法在这些方面存在不足。

Method: 使用高斯分布表示节点和边，结合不确定性感知的消息传递、混合绝对-高斯-沙漏位置编码、KAN网络注意力机制、ODE残差学习模块，以及基于余弦和Jaccard相似度的鲁棒自适应集成系数分析。

Result: 在比特币信任网络上，单时间槽预测MCC提升10.77%，冷启动场景MCC提升16.41%，在对抗性攻击下MCC提升达11.63%。

Conclusion: DGTEN统一框架在动态信任评估中表现出色，验证了其不确定性建模、时间动态捕捉和对抗防御机制的有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

TL;DR: 本文对大型语言模型遗忘方法进行了系统分类和评估，提出了更全面的评估指标，揭示了当前评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM遗忘研究缺乏清晰的有效性定义和严谨评估标准，现有评估方法过于依赖选择题准确率，无法全面反映模型的实际生成行为。

Method: 提出了12种状态遗忘方法的分类体系，分为三类方法家族：差异驱动优化、表示错位和基于拒绝的目标遗忘。引入了开放式问答指标来评估生成性能。

Result: 分析显示当前评估方法高估了成功程度，忽略了模型的实际生成行为。开放式问答指标更好地揭示了UE-UT权衡关系，并发现不同攻击场景下的鲁棒性差异显著。

Conclusion: 为LLM遗忘研究提供了全面的重新审视和可操作的指导，强调需要更细粒度的鲁棒性分析和更全面的评估指标。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

Conclusion: 该研究为网络干扰下的多臂老虎机问题提供了兼顾遗憾最小化和推断精度的理论框架和实用算法，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

Motivation: 持续学习是神经网络在不丢失先前获得知识的情况下学习多个顺序任务的能力，这是开发真正自适应人工智能的重要障碍。深度学习中过拟合是常见问题，需要正则化技术来防止灾难性遗忘。

Method: 在损失函数中引入基于簇间分离的正则化项，惩罚模型产生远离先前任务数据簇中心的输出，并进行超参数调优以找到最佳正则化权重。

Result: 在标准的5任务Split CIFAR-10基准测试和ResNet-18架构上，ICS在保持初始任务性能方面表现出有效性，但在长期知识保留方面存在局限性，特别是当任务数量增加时。

Conclusion: 该方法突显了持续学习中的复杂性和权衡，为未来研究指明了方向，需要进一步解决长期知识保留的挑战。

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18
architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong
performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations
in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks
increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual
learning and points toward avenues for further research.

TL;DR: 本文提出Value Flows方法，使用基于流的模型来估计完整的未来回报分布，并通过流匹配目标满足分布贝尔曼方程，从而在强化学习中实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法将未来回报分布简化为单一标量值，而分布RL方法利用回报分布提供更强的学习信号。现有方法使用离散分箱或有限分位数估计，无法揭示回报分布的细粒度结构，也难以识别高不确定性状态进行决策。

Method: 使用基于流的灵活模型估计完整未来回报分布；制定新的流匹配目标，生成满足分布贝尔曼方程的概率密度路径；基于学习到的流模型，通过新的流导数ODE估计各状态的回报不确定性；利用不确定性信息优先学习某些转换的更准确回报估计。

Result: 在37个基于状态和25个基于图像的基准任务上，Value Flows方法平均成功率提高了1.3倍。

Conclusion: 基于流的模型能够有效估计完整回报分布并识别高不确定性状态，在离线和在线到在线设置中均优于现有方法。

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半异步联邦学习(SAFL)在梯度聚合和模型聚合策略之间存在权衡：梯度聚合收敛快但波动大，模型聚合稳定但收敛慢且精度低。需要统一解决方案来平衡这些特性。

Method: FedQS采用分治策略，根据数据分布特征和计算资源将客户端分为四种类型，并自适应优化其本地训练过程。

Result: 在计算机视觉、自然语言处理和实际任务上的广泛实验表明，FedQS实现了最高准确率、最低损失，并且收敛速度位列最快之一，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FedQS弥合了SAFL中聚合策略之间的差距，为稳定、准确和高效的联邦学习提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are

Motivation: 解决AI电商直播中数字人需要实时响应，而大型推理模型延迟过高的问题。

Method: 第一阶段：将670B教师模型蒸馏为30B MoE模型（3B激活）；第二阶段：使用GRPO强化学习压缩推理路径，平衡正确性、帮助性和简洁性。

Result: 计算成本降低30倍，延迟达到亚秒级；在淘宝直播中，响应正确性提升3.3%，帮助性提升21.8%；显著提升GMV。

Conclusion: LiveThinking在实时交互场景中有效提升用户体验和商业表现，证明了其在电商直播中的实用价值。

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

Motivation: 传统Graph Random Features (GRFs)存在长期未解决的局限性，包括难以建模远距离节点关系、依赖采样长图随机行走效率低下，以及行走终止机制过于简单。

Method: 采用行走缝合技术，将多个短行走拼接而不破坏无偏性；扩展行走终止机制，应用更一般的行走长度分布策略；用并行计算短行走和矩阵乘法替代顺序采样长行走。

Result: GRFs++继承了长行走的近似质量但效率更高，在不增加计算成本的情况下提高了图核的近似精度。

Conclusion: GRFs++通过创新的行走缝合和灵活的终止策略，有效解决了传统GRFs的局限性，在保持无偏性的同时显著提升了计算效率和近似精度。

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: DEAS框架通过动作序列和分离价值学习有效解决了离线强化学习中的长时程规划问题，在各种复杂任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 由于高收集成本和隐私问题，获取大规模LBSN轨迹数据困难，而合成数据生成技术可生成保留真实数据特征且保护隐私的合成数据。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用稀疏感知时空扩散模型学习潜在运动序列；第二阶段使用Transformer-based Seq2Seq架构生成细粒度轨迹。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，GeoGen在保真度和实用性评估方面优于最先进模型，在FS-TKY数据集上距离和半径指标分别提高69%和55%。

Conclusion: GeoGen有效解决了LBSN签到轨迹生成的挑战，为POI推荐、广告投放等应用提供了高质量合成数据解决方案。

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了MeSH方案，通过外部化状态管理到显式内存缓冲区和使用轻量级路由器动态多样化迭代计算，解决了递归变换器中的计算未分化和信息过载问题，在Pythia套件上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归变换器虽然参数复用且迭代隐藏状态多次，但在相同计算量下，参数较少的递归模型往往落后于非递归模型。研究发现这主要源于两个瓶颈：计算未分化（核心在每次迭代中被迫采用相似计算模式）和信息过载（长期和瞬时信息必须在单个隐藏状态中共存）。

Method: 引入Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH)方案，将状态管理外部化到显式内存缓冲区，并使用轻量级路由器动态多样化不同迭代的计算。通过可视化探测确认MeSH成功解决了这些病理问题。

Result: 在Pythia套件（160M-1.4B）上，MeSH增强的递归变换器持续优于递归基线，并在1.4B规模上超越了更大的非递归对应模型，平均下游准确率提高了+1.06%，同时非嵌入参数减少了33%。

Conclusion: MeSH被确立为构建更强递归模型的可扩展和原则性架构，通过诱导迭代间的功能专门化成功解决了递归变换器的核心瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedBook是一个联邦图基础模型代码本，通过两阶段过程（域内协作和域间整合）来构建鲁棒的全局代码本，在保护隐私的同时提升跨域图学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图基础模型通常需要集中访问多领域图数据，这在隐私和制度约束下往往不可行。联邦图基础模型解决了这一限制，但其有效性依赖于构建一个既能实现域内语义一致性又能保持域间多样性的全局代码本。

Method: FedBook采用两阶段过程：1) 域内协作 - 通过参考语义更可靠的高频token来精炼低频token，增强域内一致性；2) 域间整合 - 根据客户端代码本的语义独特性加权聚合，保持跨域多样性。

Result: 在8个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，FedBook在多个领域和任务中持续优于21个基线方法，包括孤立监督学习、FL/FGL、集中式GFM的联邦适应和FedGFM技术。

Conclusion: FedBook通过系统化的联邦预训练过程，成功构建了鲁棒的全局代码本，在保护数据隐私的同时显著提升了图基础模型的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain
diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including
isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized
GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的锐度度量与泛化能力的相关性通常不强，有时甚至很弱。为了弥补直觉与现实之间的差距，需要一种能更好反映泛化性能的锐度度量方法。

Method: 定义Rényi锐度为损失Hessian矩阵的负Rényi熵，通过Rényi熵简洁地表征Hessian特征值的分布程度。提出了Rényi锐度感知最小化(RSAM)作为正则化训练方法。

Result: 实验验证了Rényi锐度与泛化能力之间存在强相关性（特别是Kendall秩相关）。RSAM方法在所有现有的锐度感知最小化方法中表现最佳，相比经典SAM方法测试精度提升可达近2.5%。

Conclusion: Rényi锐度是一种有效的泛化能力度量指标，基于此提出的RSAM训练方法能显著提升模型性能，为理解神经网络泛化提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.

Conclusion: VAMO方法通过验证集对齐的多任务优化，在动态广告竞价环境中实现了更好的泛化性能和竞价效果

Abstract: In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to
numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently,
resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task
learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through
shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 无线联邦学习中，客户端需要通过带宽受限的通道传输高维DNN参数，导致通信延迟问题。现有方法为所有DNN层分配相同调制级别，未能充分利用各层重要性的差异。

Method: 考虑DNN层的重要性，提出层自适应调制方案，自动为不同层决定最优调制级别，提供更多自由度来节省延迟。

Conclusion: 层自适应调制方案能有效减少无线联邦学习的通信延迟，通过考虑层重要性实现更高效的通信。

Abstract: In wireless federated learning (FL), the clients need to transmit the
high-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) parameters through bandwidth-limited
channels, which causes the communication latency issue. In this paper, we
propose a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme to save the communication
latency. Unlike existing works which assign the same modulation level for all
DNN layers, we consider the layers' importance which provides more freedom to
save the latency. The proposed scheme can automatically decide the optimal
modulation levels for different DNN layers. Experimental results show that the
proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared with the
existing schemes.

Motivation: 理解作物和林业害虫的扩散动态可以更好地预测爆发强度和位置，从而实现更好的害虫管理。昆虫在感染、捕食和各向异性环境条件下可能表现出优先运动模式。

Method: 使用弱形式稀疏识别非线性动力学(WSINDy)算法，结合核密度估计，从稀疏的位置测量数据中学习Fokker-Planck方程。

Conclusion: 弱形式方程学习技术能够从高度稀疏的实验数据中学习有效的昆虫种群运动模型，为害虫管理提供预测工具。

Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental
conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate
stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short
timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic
dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the
underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as
ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding
dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better
forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest
management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques,
coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for
lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.
Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing
equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the
method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms
(Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with
varied plant resources and infection status.

Conclusion: HySim-LLM为生物医学和数据密集型科学领域提供了可靠且可解释的LLM适应路径，建立了数学基础来应对结构化数据处理的挑战。

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法在让LLMs遗忘敏感信息时，往往会损害模型的原有能力和知识，需要一种既能有效遗忘又能保持模型效用的方法。

Method: 采用两步框架，基于二阶优化器方法，但只选择性更新负责编码遗忘集的关键神经元，而不是全局更新所有参数。

Result: SIMU在实现可比遗忘效果的同时，在保持模型原有知识方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 选择性更新关键神经元的策略能够有效平衡遗忘效果与知识保留，为机器学习遗忘提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model
behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that
enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For
machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have
shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information.
However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original
capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior
knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence
Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order
optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons
responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these
targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while
substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original
knowledge.

Motivation: 现有防御机制无法泛化到未见攻击模板伪装的有害查询，尽管LLMs在嵌入空间能够区分这些查询。

Method: 提出两阶段防御方法：预生成防御在响应生成前检测有害查询，生成中防御在生成过程中监控部分响应以防止输出更多有害内容。通过专门提示训练LLM预测查询和部分响应的危害性。

Result: 在多个LLM架构上的实验表明，MetaDefense显著优于现有防御机制，对已见和未见攻击模板的有害查询都能实现鲁棒防御，同时在良性任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MetaDefense框架通过早期终止潜在有害交互，有效防御微调越狱攻击，为LLM安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining
competitive performance on benign tasks. Code is available at

Conclusion: 测试时自改进算法展示了构建更强大智能体实现自我演化的新范式潜力

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

Conclusion: MA-GAD框架通过图压缩和元学习的结合，有效解决了少样本图级异常检测中的噪声干扰和标注数据不足问题

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs
within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud
detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely
heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on
GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and
reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD),
incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size,
mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We
also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar
networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly
adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection
performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the
distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based
on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under
few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly
detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images often suffer from noise
contamination, which degrades image quality and affects further analysis. This
research presents a complete approach to estimate their Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) and noise variance (NV), and enhance image quality using NV-guided Wiener
filter. The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique
and infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then
guides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and
accurate SEM image filtering pipeline. First, we investigate five different SNR
estimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order
Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order
Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression
(NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown
that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR.
In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it
stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these
results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression
Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR
method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided
Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is
shown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and
leads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process.

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上评估，与GNN-based SafeDrug模型相比，F1分数(p=0.0387)、Jaccard(p=0.0112)和DDI率(p=0.0386)均有统计学显著改善

Conclusion: 基于ELF的3D表示有潜力提高预测准确性，支持临床实践中更安全的组合药物处方

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

TL;DR: 提出DUA-D2C方法，通过动态不确定性感知的聚合机制改进Divide2Conquer方法，有效对抗深度学习中的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Divide2Conquer方法中标准聚合策略对所有子集模型一视同仁的问题，无法充分利用不同子集模型泛化能力的差异。

Method: 在D2C基础上，引入动态不确定性感知聚合，基于共享验证集上的性能和预测不确定性来动态加权子集模型的贡献。

Result: 在多个领域的基准数据集上，DUA-D2C显著提高了泛化性能，即使在其他正则化方法之上应用也能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: DUA-D2C是一种理论基础扎实且有效的方法，能够有效对抗现代深度学习中的过拟合问题。

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

*Murtaza Rangwala,Farag Azzedin,Richard O. Sinnott,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SketchGuard是一个去中心化联邦学习框架，通过基于草图的邻居筛选来防御拜占庭攻击，显著降低了通信和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拜占庭鲁棒DFL防御方法需要每个客户端在每轮训练中与所有邻居交换和比较完整的高维模型向量，产生了过高的通信和计算成本，无法在web规模部署。

Method: 使用Count Sketch将d维模型压缩到k维草图（k << d）进行相似性比较，然后仅从接受的邻居处选择性获取完整模型，将通信复杂度从O(d|N_i|)降低到O(k|N_i| + d|S_i|)。

Result: 在多个数据集、网络拓扑和攻击场景下的实验表明，SketchGuard保持了与最先进方法相同的鲁棒性，同时将计算时间减少高达82%，通信开销减少50-70%。

Conclusion: 基于草图压缩的方法是实现web规模鲁棒DFL的基本使能器，其优势随模型维度和网络连接性的增加而倍增。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving
collaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates.
Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor
screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete
high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round,
creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent
deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that
decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based
neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to
$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity
comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,
reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +
d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \le |N_i|$ is the
accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both
strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression
preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where
approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor in the effective
threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,
network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains
identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation
time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering
effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality
and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based
compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于SNN时间特性的自蒸馏方法，将SNN的每个时间步视为子模型，通过强-弱关系进行双向蒸馏，有效提升SNN性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN与ANN存在性能差距，传统知识蒸馏方法依赖大模型或引入额外训练开销，需要更高效的SNN训练方法。

Method: 将SNN每个时间步实例视为子模型，评估其输出置信度识别强弱关系，提出Strong2Weak和Weak2Strong两种自蒸馏方案，支持集成、同步和级联蒸馏实现。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升了SNN的判别能力和整体性能，同时增强了对抗鲁棒性，受益于自蒸馏带来的稳定性。

Conclusion: 巧妙利用SNN的时间特性，为高效训练高性能SNN提供了新思路。

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to be a low-power
alternative to computationally intensive artificial neural networks (ANNs),
although performance gaps persist. Recent studies have improved the performance
of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or
introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be
naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient
self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and
evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the
weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient
self-distillation schemes: (1) \textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the
stronger "teacher" guides the weaker "student", effectively improving overall
performance. (2) \textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the "teacher",
distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding
significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible
implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.
Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and
overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also
enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This
ingeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into
how to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.

Motivation: 改进神经网络风险证书的实用性和紧密度，特别是在不同经验风险范围内获得更紧的显式边界，并将PAC-Bayesian风险证书优化整合到模型训练过程中。

Method: 1) 推导Bernoulli分布KL散度的两个边界；2) 基于隐式微分的方法将PAC-Bayesian风险证书优化融入损失函数；3) 优化非可微目标（如0-1损失）的边界。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实证评估显示，该方法能够推导出非平凡的泛化边界，特别是在CIFAR-10上首次实现了神经网络的非平凡泛化边界。

Conclusion: 提出的理论贡献显著提高了PAC-Bayes风险证书的实用性和紧密度，为神经网络提供了更可靠的风险评估工具，特别是在复杂数据集上实现了突破性的非平凡泛化边界。

Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability
of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two
bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the
derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers
across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the
formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation
that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk
certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model.
The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable
objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are
complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on
CIFAR-10 for neural networks.

TL;DR: DISCO提出了一种新的模型评估方法，通过选择模型响应差异最大的样本来替代传统基于聚类的锚点子集选择，降低了评估成本并提高了性能预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型评估成本过高，传统方法依赖复杂的聚类选择锚点子集，限制了创新包容性和环境可持续性。

Method: DISCO方法选择模型响应差异最大的前k个样本，使用贪心的样本级统计而非全局聚类，理论证明模型间分歧提供了信息理论最优的选择规则。

Result: 在MMLU、Hellaswag、Winogrande和ARC等基准测试中，DISCO实现了最先进的性能预测结果。

Conclusion: DISCO通过简化样本选择过程，在降低评估成本的同时提高了预测准确性，为高效模型评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Evaluating modern machine learning models has become prohibitively expensive.
Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model.
Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and
worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First,
select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on
this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection
depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We
argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is
to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our
method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k
samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise
statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler.
From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an
information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection.
$\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag,
Winogrande, and ARC. Code is available here:

TL;DR: 提出了PRESCRIBE框架，用于单细胞扰动预测中联合估计模型不确定性和数据不确定性，通过置信度评分提高预测可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞扰动预测需要同时考虑模型不确定性和数据不确定性，因为基因扰动是随机生化过程，需要评估预测的可靠性

Method: 采用多变量深度证据回归框架，联合测量两种不确定性来源，为每个预测生成置信度评分

Result: PRESCRIBE的置信度评分与经验准确率强相关，相比基线方法实现了超过3%的稳定准确率提升

Conclusion: PRESCRIBE能够有效识别不可靠预测，提高单细胞扰动预测的可靠性

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一个集成高效气候代理模型的MARL框架，使区域代理能在多气体动态下学习气候政策，实现100倍训练加速且不牺牲策略保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候政策研究需要能捕捉多种温室气体对全球温度综合影响的模型，但这些模型计算成本高，难以嵌入强化学习。

Method: 使用在20,000条多气体排放路径上预训练的循环神经网络架构作为CICERO-SCM气候模型的代理模型，并将其集成到MARL框架中。

Result: 代理模型达到接近模拟器的精度（温度RMSE≈0.0004K），推理速度快1000倍，在气候政策MARL设置中训练加速超过100倍，且收敛到相同最优策略。

Conclusion: 该方法绕过了核心计算瓶颈，实现了多气体动态和高保真气候响应下的大规模多智能体气候政策实验。

Abstract: Climate policy studies require models that capture the combined effects of
multiple greenhouse gases on global temperature, but these models are
computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning. We
present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a
high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment
loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas
dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network
architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to
surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains
near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004
\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When
substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it
accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate
and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology
to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our
work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing
policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across
alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity
climate response.

TL;DR: 本文通过稳定性分析推导了多流言步骤(MGS)的泛化误差和超额误差上界，系统回答了MGS在去中心化训练中的有效性原因及其与中心化训练的差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化训练虽然通信效率高，但性能往往不如中心化训练。MGS作为连接两者的桥梁能显著缩小性能差距，但其理论有效性原因和能否完全消除差距仍是未解问题。

Method: 使用稳定性分析推导MGS的泛化误差和超额误差上界，分析学习率、数据异质性、节点数量、节点样本量和通信拓扑等因素对MGS泛化性能的影响。

Result: 1) MGS以指数速率减少优化误差，从而指数收紧泛化误差边界；2) 即使MGS趋于无穷，与中心化训练仍存在不可忽略的泛化误差差距；3) 在CIFAR数据集上的实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: MGS能显著改善去中心化训练性能，但无法完全消除与中心化训练的差距，为去中心化训练提供了重要的理论指导。

Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a
communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training
efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to
centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective
bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing
experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its
effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open
questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error
and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering
these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the
optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially
tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better
solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a
non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized
mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in
centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n
m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the
first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,
node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the
generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients
assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.
Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical
findings.

TL;DR: 本文首次展示了现代LLM剪枝方法可能被恶意利用，攻击者可以构造一个看似良性的模型，但在剪枝后表现出恶意行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型剪枝已成为减少大语言模型推理时内存占用的重要方法，但其安全影响尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 攻击者计算每个参数被剪枝可能性的代理指标，将恶意行为注入到不太可能被剪枝的参数中，然后用可能被剪枝的参数修复模型，从而在未剪枝模型中抵消注入的行为。

Result: 在五个模型上的广泛评估显示，经过vLLM中的任何剪枝方法（Magnitude、Wanda和SparseGPT）处理后，模型在多种攻击场景中持续表现出强烈的恶意行为（越狱成功率高达95.7%，良性指令拒绝率98.7%，目标内容注入成功率99.5%）。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了部署时的关键安全漏洞，强调了在模型压缩中加强安全意识的紧迫性。

Abstract: Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a
prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models
(LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM,
enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed.
While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved
significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In
this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be
maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that
appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is
based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates
how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary
can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely
to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are
likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the
unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive
evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied
(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious
behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$
for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for
targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time
security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in
model compression.

Conclusion: 检查点回收方法为经济高效的大语言模型预训练奠定了基础

Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational cost of pretraining Large Language
Models necessitates more efficient approaches. Numerous computational costs
have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them
remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity.
To efficiently reuse this "sunk" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained
checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We
propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts
model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication
with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such
growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling
experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation
with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to
better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and
over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from
scratch under the same additional compute budget. Our checkpoint recycling
approach establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language
model pretraining.

Motivation: 现有个性化PageRank计算方法在大规模图上效率较低，需要开发更快的算法来应对大规模图数据分析需求。

Method: 使用嵌套演化集过程框架，在每个阶段采用局部化不精确近端点迭代求解简化线性系统，减少计算复杂度。

Result: 算法时间复杂度为min{Õ(R²/ε²), Õ(m)}，其中m为边数，R为常数。仅需求解Õ(1/√α)个线性系统，当1/ε²≪m时，总复杂度为Õ(R²/(√αε²))，与图规模无关。

Conclusion: 该框架显著加速了PPR计算，解决了文献中的开放猜想，实验验证了在真实图上的高效性，早期阶段即表现出显著收敛。

Abstract: This work proposes a novel framework based on nested evolving set processes
to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the
process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a
simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized
methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximation of the PPR
vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a
constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms
induced by our framework require solving only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$ such linear systems, where $\alpha$ is
the damping factor. When $1/\epsilon^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an
algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an
overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 /
(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size.
Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature. Experimental
results on real-world graphs validate the efficiency of our methods,
demonstrating significant convergence in the early stages.

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and
localization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically
require costly calibration pro- cesses to collect location-labeled channel
state information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data
collection trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence,
eliminating the need for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a
hidden Markov model (HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel
propagation matrix, while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in
the trajectory. The primary challenges involve modeling the complex
relationship between channel propagation in multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) networks and geographical locations, and addressing both line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose
an HMM-based framework that jointly characterizes the conditional propagation
model and the evolution of the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel
propagation in MIMO networks is modeled separately in terms of power, delay,
and angle, with distinct models for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user
trajectory is modeled using a Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel
propagation, the mobility model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized
simultaneously. Experimental validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal
Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform
linear arrays (ULA) configuration demonstrates that the proposed method
achieves an average localization accuracy of 0.65 meters in an indoor
environment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions. Moreover, the constructed
radio map enables localization with a reduced error compared to conventional
supervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine

*Stanisław Pawlak,Jan Dubiński,Daniel Marczak,Bartłomiej Twardowski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Backdoor Vector(BV)框架来理解模型合并中的后门攻击，将攻击视为任务向量。同时提出了Sparse Backdoor Vector(SBV)来增强攻击效果，以及Injection BV Subtraction(IBVS)防御方法来对抗后门威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型合并方法虽然有效，但存在严重的安全风险，容易受到后门攻击。现有研究表明单个微调模型的后门可以在合并后控制最终模型的输出，这构成了重大安全威胁。

Method: 1. 将后门攻击建模为任务向量(BV)，计算后门模型与干净模型的权重差异；2. 提出SBV方法，通过合并多个攻击来增强后门效果；3. 提出IBVS防御方法，通过减去注入的BV来消除后门。

Result: SBV方法超越了之前的攻击方法，是首个利用合并来提升后门有效性的技术。IBVS防御方法提供了一种轻量级、通用的防御方案，即使在完全未知后门威胁的情况下也能保持有效。

Conclusion: 通过BV框架可以更好地理解后门攻击的本质，SBV展示了合并技术可以增强攻击效果，而IBVS为模型合并提供了有效的安全保障，解决了后门攻击的核心漏洞问题。

Abstract: Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining
large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks.
Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which
introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows
the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference
time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor
attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\
(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned
backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into
attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their
similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that
enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\
(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core
vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit
adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose
$Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against
backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the
first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same
time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even
when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.

### [141] [Do We Really Need Permutations? Impact of Width Expansion on Linear Mode Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08023)
*Akira Ito,Masanori Yamada,Daiki Chijiwa,Atsutoshi Kumagai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使不使用参数排列，仅通过增加模型宽度和合适的softmax温度校准就能实现线性模式连接(LMC)。作者提出了层间指数加权连接(LEWC)来解释这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究认为实现LMC需要参数排列搜索和足够宽的模型，但本研究旨在验证仅通过模型宽度扩展是否足以实现LMC。

Method: 使用softmax温度校准，分析中间层输出，提出层间指数加权连接(LEWC)概念，将合并模型的每层输出表示为原始模型对应层输出的指数加权和。

Result: 实证证明，即使没有参数排列，仅通过模型宽度扩展和合适的温度校准就能实现LMC，且合并模型的输出与原始模型的集成输出相匹配。

Conclusion: 模型宽度扩展不仅促进非线性模式连接，还能显著提高实现线性模式连接的可能性，这是首次发现宽度对LMC的直接影响。

Abstract: Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two
independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves
the input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss
linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear
mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have
reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search
but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\times$ width multiplier for
ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width
ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance
of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,
even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for
achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further
explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.
Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity
(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be
represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the
corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's
output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates
LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening
the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in
prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving
linear mode connectivity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层预填充调度方法，将transformer层组作为主要调度单元，通过垂直分区和交错调度消除MoE模型中的权重重载开销，显著降低延迟和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分块预填充的调度方法在MoE模型中会导致专家权重重复加载，增加内存流量和能耗，需要更高效的调度方案。

Method: 将模型垂直划分为连续的层组，在层组间交错进行预填充和解码操作，避免分块引起的MoE权重重载问题。

Result: 降低片外带宽需求，TTFT减少高达70%，端到端延迟降低41%，每token能耗降低22%，改善TTFT-TBT帕累托边界。

Conclusion: 从token轴转向层轴调度为共置环境中的高效、节能LLM服务开辟了新操作机制。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production must meet stringent
service-level objectives for both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and
time-between-token (TBT) while maximizing throughput under fixed compute,
memory, and interconnect budgets. Modern serving systems adopt stall-free
scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt
processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing
decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs
substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert
weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy
consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats
transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically
partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill
and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding
while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip
bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and
per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill
consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,
reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free
decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a
new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in
co-located environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主体特异性分布偏移是EEG解码基础模型发展的重要障碍，需要解决主体间变异性问题。

Method: 设计自适应层作为标准线性或卷积层的替代，将权重分解为共享的主体不变组件和轻量级低秩修正组件。

Result: 配备该层的模型在性能上优于仅共享权重的模型和单独训练的主体特定模型的平均值。

Conclusion: Subject-Conditioned Layer为构建有效的跨主体EEG基础模型提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Subject-specific distribution shifts represent an important obstacle to the
development of foundation models for EEG decoding. To address this, we propose
Subject-Conditioned Layer,, an adaptive layer designed as a drop-in replacement
for standard linear or convolutional layers in any neural network architecture.
Our layer captures subject-specific variability by decomposing its weights into
a shared, subject-invariant component and a lightweight, low-rank correction
unique to each subject. This explicit separation of general knowledge from
personalized adaptation allows existing models to become robust to subject
shifts. Empirically, models equipped with our layer outperform both a
shared-weight-only model (subject-agnostic model) and the average of
individually trained subject-specific models. Consequently, the
Subject-Conditioned Layer, offers a practical and scalable path towards
building effective cross-subject foundation models for EEG.

Motivation: 随着复杂学习代理与现有专家（如人类操作员或已训练代理）共同部署，需要明确如何最优地整合结构可能不同的专家数据。

Method: 在贝叶斯多臂老虎机背景下，研究离线设置（在交互前接收专家最优策略的数据集）和同时设置（在每一步选择基于自身经验或专家结果更新信念），提出信息导向规则和信任推断策略。

Conclusion: 通过量化专家数据的价值，该框架为代理智能决定何时向他人学习提供了实用的信息论算法。

Abstract: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts,
such as human operators or previously trained agents. However, it remains
unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data,
which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome
experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed
bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a
dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and
(ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether
to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome
simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences
the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens
information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the
expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an
information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that
maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we
propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and
when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is
ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our
framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to
intelligently decide when to learn from others.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了近似领域遗忘(ADU)的新问题设置，旨在让预训练视觉语言模型(VLMs)在保持其他领域准确性的同时，降低对指定领域图像的识别准确率，以解决实际应用中的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有近似遗忘方法主要关注类别遗忘，但在实际应用中仅遗忘对象类别往往不够。例如，自动驾驶系统需要准确识别真实汽车，同时避免将路边广告中的插画汽车误认为真实汽车，这可能带来安全隐患。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，通过显式解耦领域分布并自适应捕获实例特定的领域信息，来解决预训练VLMs中领域分布高度纠缠的问题。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在基于VLM调优技术构建的基线方法上表现更优。

Conclusion: 这项工作为VLMs中实用且细粒度的遗忘技术开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization
capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse
domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant
information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising
concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This
has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to
selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model
performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily
focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize
specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely
forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For
instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars
while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside
advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we
introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that
requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,
illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU
presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization
capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in
the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains
ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that
explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures
instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our
approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way
for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:

TL;DR: 提出AEPO方法解决强化学习微调中的熵崩溃问题，通过温度调节实现精确的熵控制，揭示熵与性能的非单调关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法存在熵崩溃问题，即熵单调下降导致探索消失和策略过早收敛，现有熵正则化方法只能部分缓解此问题但引入偏差和不稳定性。

Method: 提出AEPO方法，用温度调整分布上的REINFORCE策略梯度替代熵奖励，通过温度调节稳定熵，包含三个关键设计：策略梯度作为正则化、分布作为正则化、REINFORCE作为正则化。

Result: AEPO在任意目标水平稳定熵，有效消除GRPO中的崩溃；揭示熵与性能的非单调关系（先改善后下降）；提供更广泛的RFT范式，其中优越的目标分布可作为REINFORCE正则化器。

Conclusion: AEPO解决了熵崩溃问题，实现了精确的熵控制，阐明了熵、探索和推理之间的联系，并为RFT提供了更通用的范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where
entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge
prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this
issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control
unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance
unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy
gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through
temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as
regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as
regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting
optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)
stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in
GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves
then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,
exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a
broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE
regularizers.

Motivation: 利用推理模型中出现的置信度校准特性，在模型早期获得正确答案时停止推理，节省计算资源并减少延迟。

Method: 使用token级logprobs的香农熵作为置信度信号，通过少量示例计算模型特定的熵阈值，实现早期停止机制。

Result: 在推理优化模型家族中实现25-50%计算成本降低，同时保持准确性，表明置信度机制是现代后训练推理系统的显著特征。

Conclusion: 熵基置信度校准是先进后训练优化模型的新兴特性，可有效利用模型的早期答案认知来提升推理效率。

Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token
efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses
Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable
early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task
accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration
represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present
in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and
pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop
reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot
using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results
indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a
correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be
exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates
consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50%
computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that
confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern
post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.

Conclusion: GALA通过高效的计算策略和动态加权机制，实现了在大规模异构源域下的稳定和可并行训练，解决了多源域自适应的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims to learn models that
generalize to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from
multiple, diverse source domains. While distributed UMDA methods address
privacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically
assume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the
number of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,
leading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose
GALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key
components: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that
efficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic
computation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting
strategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with
the target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable
training across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance
in high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising
18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts. Extensive
experiments show that GALA consistently achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and significantly outperforms
prior methods in diverse multi-source settings where others fail to converge.

Abstract: Person identification plays a vital role in enabling intelligent,
personalized, and secure human-computer interaction. Recent research has
demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person
identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing
work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new
opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative
advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the
first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person
identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel
dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor
environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines
and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end
deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi
signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when
combined with effective background subtraction.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in
many biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling
by their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional
token dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,
bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and
scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR
generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from
non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with
two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological
features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging
these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables
the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,
enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training
strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder
gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding
nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model
substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR
stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior
performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological
sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for
augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex
sequence generation. Code is available at https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾识别在深度学习和基础模型微调中普遍存在且具有挑战性，偏斜的类别分布阻碍了模型对尾部类别的泛化能力

Method: 引入低秩参数组件来调节参数空间分配，采用定制损失和正弦重加权调度，但不增加整体模型复杂度或推理成本

Result: 在多样化的长尾基准测试中，MORE显著提高了泛化能力，特别是对尾部类别，并能有效补充现有的不平衡缓解方法

Conclusion: MORE作为长尾设置中的鲁棒即插即用模块具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Long-tailed recognition is ubiquitous and challenging in deep learning and
even in the downstream finetuning of foundation models, since the skew class
distribution generally prevents the model generalization to the tail classes.
Despite the promise of previous methods from the perspectives of data
augmentation, loss rebalancing and decoupled training etc., consistent
improvement in the broad scenarios like multi-label long-tailed recognition is
difficult. In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact
under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing
(MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter
space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate
the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal
reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or
inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks,
spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly
improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively
complements existing imbalance mitigation methods. These results highlight
MORE's potential as a robust plug-and-play module in long-tailed settings.

Motivation: 现实世界数据集常同时面临类别不平衡和标签噪声问题，现有方法难以有效结合处理这两个问题，因为区分真实尾部样本和噪声数据很困难，常导致优化策略冲突。

Conclusion: 通过协同利用专门处理单一问题的'弱'辅助模型，可以在不冲突的情况下整合它们对类别不平衡和标签噪声的互补优势，有效提升模型的双重鲁棒性。

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

Abstract: In the shipping industry, fuel consumption and emissions are critical factors
due to their significant impact on economic efficiency and environmental
sustainability. Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for
further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous
methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of
modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce
and release a new dataset
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational
and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark
covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the
application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the
TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results
demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the
feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating
environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines
relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques,
highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning
capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context
improves accuracy.

*Nicolas Espinosa-Dice,Kiante Brantley,Wen Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVOR是一种可扩展的离线强化学习方法，通过流匹配学习正则化的Q函数，在推理时通过拒绝采样提取策略，避免了蒸馏和BPTT的计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线RL在机器人领域应用受限，主要因为缺乏可扩展性。现有方法依赖BPTT（计算昂贵）或策略蒸馏（引入复合误差），限制了向更复杂数据集的扩展。

Method: EVOR结合表达性策略和表达性值函数，通过流匹配训练正则化的最优Q函数，在推理时使用拒绝采样进行策略提取，实现高效优化和计算可扩展搜索。

Result: 在多样化的离线RL任务上，EVOR优于基线方法，证明了将表达性值学习整合到离线RL中的益处。

Conclusion: EVOR提供了一种无需蒸馏或BPTT的可扩展离线RL方法，通过表达性值学习实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make
sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,
principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising
avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly
real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly
complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and
flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either
backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or
policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability
to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to
develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or
backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for
Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that
integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns
an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At
inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection
sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient
optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.
Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of
offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value
learning into offline RL.

*Wiktor Jan Hoffmann,Sonia Laguna,Moritz Vandenhirtz,Emanuele Palumbo,Julia E. Vogt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法PSCBMs，通过添加小型协方差预测模块，无需重新训练主干模型，就能为预训练的CBM添加概念间的多元正态分布，从而提升性能和干预效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有建模概念依赖性的方法通常需要重新训练整个模型，这在原始数据或计算资源有限时不可行。

Method: 引入PSCBMs方法，仅添加小型协方差预测模块，无需重新训练主干模型，提出两种训练策略。

Result: 在真实世界数据上，PSCBMs在测试时一致匹配或优于标准CBMs的概念和目标准确性，在干预下表现更好，且比从头训练类似随机模型更高效。

Conclusion: PSCBMs是一种高效的方法，能够在不重新训练的情况下增强CBM的性能和干预能力。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are interpretable models that predict the
target variable through high-level human-understandable concepts, allowing
users to intervene on mispredicted concepts to adjust the final output. While
recent work has shown that modeling dependencies between concepts can improve
CBM performance, especially under interventions, such approaches typically
require retraining the entire model, which may be infeasible when access to the
original data or compute is limited. In this paper, we introduce Post-hoc
Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a lightweight method that
augments any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over
concepts by adding only a small covariance-prediction module, without
retraining the backbone model. We propose two training strategies and show on
real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and
target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time. Furthermore, we show that due
to the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs
under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a
similar stochastic model from scratch.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了不确定性感知马尔可夫决策过程（UAMDP），将贝叶斯预测、后验采样强化学习和条件风险价值约束规划相结合，用于波动环境中的顺序决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在波动性高、风险大的顺序决策环境中，仅最大化期望回报是不够的，需要系统性的不确定性管理方法。

Method: UAMDP框架结合贝叶斯动态预测、Thompson采样生成合理未来情景，并在预设风险容忍度下优化策略。

Result: 在高频股票交易和零售库存控制两个领域，UAMDP相比深度学习基线显著提升预测精度（RMSE降低25%，sMAPE降低32%），交易夏普比率从1.54提升至1.74，最大回撤减半。

Conclusion: 整合校准的概率建模、与后验不确定性对齐的探索以及风险感知控制，能够实现更稳健、可泛化的顺序决策方法，提高安全性和盈利能力。

Abstract: Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than
maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.
This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a
unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling
reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent
dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes
policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that
converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.
We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail
inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic
volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves
long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by
32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe
ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These
results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration
aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,
generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出了DMPO方法，一种专门为扩散大语言模型设计的强化学习微调方法，通过分布匹配提升推理能力，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归模型的替代方案具有更高推理吞吐量，但需要专门的强化学习方法来提升推理性能。

Method: DMPO通过交叉熵优化将dLLM策略分布与最优奖励倾斜分布匹配，解决了小训练批次的关键挑战，并提出了权重基线减法技术。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，DMPO无需监督微调即可实现显著性能提升，比现有SOTA基线准确率最高提升42.9%，比基础模型提升55.8%。

Conclusion: 分布匹配框架对提升dLLM推理能力非常有效，DMPO为dLLM的强化学习微调提供了理论基础和实践解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to
autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow
higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component
for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks,
such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs'
unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes
Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and
theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to
the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify
a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and
propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction
technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks
without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$
over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring
the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework. Our code is available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究使用政治罗盘测试评估了8个主流大语言模型的政治偏见和刻板印象传播，发现所有模型都呈现左倾政治倾向，且通过语言变化引发的隐性刻板印象比显性刻板印象更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在社会信息传播和决策过程中的作用日益重要，理解其政治偏见对于防止对公众舆论和民主进程产生不当影响至关重要。

Method: 采用二维政治罗盘测试评估模型的内在政治倾向，使用角色提示探索显性刻板印象，并通过多语言版本测试揭示隐性刻板印象。

Result: 所有被调查模型都呈现一致左倾政治倾向；不同模型的刻板印象性质和程度差异很大；隐性刻板印象比显性刻板印象更明显；大多数模型的隐性和显性刻板印象存在显著一致性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大语言模型中政治偏见和刻板印象的复杂相互作用，表明模型对其固有偏见存在一定程度的透明度或"意识"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increas- ingly integral to information
dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their grow- ing societal
influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political
domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic
processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propa- gation
across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test
(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the in- herent political
leanings of these models. Sub- sequently, persona prompting with the PCT is
used to explore explicit stereotypes across vari- ous social dimensions. In a
final step, implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating mod- els with
multilingual versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning
polit- ical alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the
nature and extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit
stereotypes elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those
iden- tified via explicit persona prompting. Interest- ingly, for most models,
implicit and explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggest- ing a
degree of transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This
study un- derscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in
LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了基于LLM的智能体中的对手塑造问题，提出了ShapeLLM方法，证明LLM智能体能够在竞争性和合作性游戏中影响对手的学习动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM作为自主智能体在现实环境中部署，多智能体交互不可避免。需要了解这些系统中的战略行为，特别是LLM智能体是否能够像强化学习智能体一样通过交互塑造对手的学习动态。

Method: 提出了ShapeLLM方法，这是针对基于Transformer的智能体量身定制的无模型对手塑造方法的适配版本，解决了现有OS算法无法直接应用于LLM的问题。

Result: 实验表明，LLM智能体能够在竞争性游戏中成功引导对手走向可被利用的均衡，在合作性游戏中促进协调并提高集体福利。

Conclusion: LLM智能体能够通过交互塑造对手并被对手塑造，确立了对手塑造作为多智能体LLM研究的关键维度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

TL;DR: Mix- and MoE-DPO扩展了DPO方法，使用混合模型和专家混合架构，通过变分推理学习专业化专家策略，在多任务和异构偏好设置中提供更好的表达能力和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法依赖单一模型，限制了在多任务环境中的表达能力和对异构偏好分布的适应性。

Method: 提出基于软混合模型和MoE架构的框架，使用随机变分推理方法，引入专家分配的潜变量模型并优化变分证据下界。

Result: 在多种模型大小和多偏好数据集上的验证表明，该方法提供了强大且可扩展的基于偏好的LLM对齐方法。

Conclusion: Mix- and MoE-DPO通过混合架构实现了通用函数逼近、奖励和策略专业化以及上下文对齐，为偏好学习提供了更灵活和强大的框架。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 本文解决了高维多变量结果的反事实识别问题，使用连续时间流方法建立了反事实识别的基础理论，确保因果推断的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实推断方法缺乏识别性，削弱了因果估计的有效性。Pearl(2000)指出反事实必须可识别才能证明因果主张的合理性。

Method: 使用连续时间流匹配方法，包括非马尔可夫设置，利用动态最优传输工具构建独特、单调且保持秩的反事实传输映射。

Result: 在具有反事实真实值的受控场景中验证了理论，并在真实图像上展示了反事实公理合理性的改进。

Conclusion: 建立了多变量反事实识别的理论基础，确保反事实推断的一致性和因果有效性。

Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for
high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000)
argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the
observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on
counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification,
undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish
a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using
continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard
criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a
unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools
from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on
this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual
ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness
on real images.

TL;DR: 本文研究Transformer在集合补集任务中的长度泛化能力，发现单层注意力模型在长度1和2上实现平衡logit位移时能够泛化到更长序列，但精度会下降。研究揭示了softmax压缩和训练噪声两个障碍，并提出dropout和EMA分别应对这些挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer在集合补集任务中的长度泛化能力，该任务要求模型预测输入序列中缺失的token的均匀分布，这对于棋盘游戏式推理至关重要。

Method: 理论分析单层注意力Transformer的嵌入和值维度边界，证明在长度1和2实现平衡logit位移时的泛化能力。通过随机超参数搜索验证dropout和EMA的作用，并在OthelloGPT模型上进行测试。

Result: 理论证明单层注意力模型在满足条件时可以泛化到更长序列，但精度下降。实验验证dropout可以缓解softmax压缩效应，EMA可以减少训练噪声，两者都能改善长度泛化能力。

Conclusion: Transformer在集合补集任务中的长度泛化受到softmax压缩和训练噪声的限制，dropout和EMA分别能有效缓解这些问题，提升模型在复杂任务中的泛化性能。

Abstract: We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement
task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from
an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main
theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on
embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.
Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at
lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with
reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:
as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding
separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a
second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We
hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving
Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random
hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both
mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random
Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this
more complex setting.

Motivation: 传统时间序列生成方法往往忽略领域特定的物理约束，限制了统计和物理一致性，需要引入物理感知的归纳偏置。

Method: 结合傅里叶神经算子学习物理算子，使用条件流匹配进行概率生成，通过时间依赖的层次约束和FNO引导的修正进行集成。

Result: 在谐振子、人体活动识别和锂离子电池退化实验中，生成质量提高16.3%，物理违规减少46%，预测精度提升18.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将物理层次结构嵌入生成模型，显著提升了生成质量和物理一致性，为物理约束的时间序列生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical
constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a
hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical
laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into
deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed
inductive bias. Our method combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for
learning physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for
probabilistic generation, integrated via time-dependent hierarchical
constraints and FNO-guided corrections. Experiments on harmonic oscillators,
human activity recognition, and lithium-ion battery degradation show 16.3%
higher generation quality, 46% fewer physics violations, and 18.5% improved
predictive accuracy over baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统肠内营养治疗主要依赖指南和经验，缺乏个性化调整，无法适应患者动态变化的生理状态。

Method: 使用双深度Q网络和保守Q学习正则化，基于MIMIC-IV数据库中11,000多名ICU患者数据离线训练，每4小时生成热量、蛋白质和液体摄入的个性化推荐。

Result: DeepEN相比临床医生和指南方法，将估计死亡率降低了3.7个百分点（18.8% vs 22.5%），并在关键营养生物标志物上表现更好。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的肠内营养个性化治疗有潜力超越传统的指南或启发式方法，改善患者预后。

Abstract: We introduce DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
personalized enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients. Trained offline
on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates
4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to
each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically
informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term
physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes.
Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning
regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with
high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across
various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms
clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17
percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and
improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the
potential of safe, data-driven personalization of EN therapy to improve
outcomes beyond traditional guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.

Motivation: 6G网络中AI模型需要适应不断变化的环境，包括新特征引入、多供应商部署、硬件升级等，需要灵活的持续学习方法。

Method: 采用自适应随机森林进行迭代训练以适应动态特征，并提出DAFI方法结合分布漂移检测来优化特征重要性计算效率。

Result: 测试表明ARFs能实现稳定预测且准确率随时间提升，DAFI方法可将运行时间减少2倍，同时产生更一致的特征重要性值。

Conclusion: ARFs和DAFI为6G网络用例提供了一个有前景的灵活AI方法框架，能够有效处理动态特征适应和可解释性问题。

Abstract: As AI becomes a native component of 6G network control, AI models must adapt
to continuously changing conditions, including the introduction of new features
and measurements driven by multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and
evolving service requirements. To address this growing need for flexible
learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive
Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in
communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can
effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as
more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of
explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance
(DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a
distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive
FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets
indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing
more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a
promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network
use-cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法存在参数干扰问题，MoE-based LoRA变体虽然能缓解单任务内的相关性，但在多任务模型合并中仍存在任务间干扰，且引入额外路由器参数。

Method: 提出FlyLoRA：1）在up-projection矩阵中引入rank-wise专家激活；2）使用隐式路由器统一专家路由和down-projection，用冻结的稀疏随机投影矩阵替代传统密集可训练版本。

Result: 在通用知识理解、科学问答、数学推理和代码生成四个领域的广泛实验表明，FlyLoRA相比现有方法实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: FlyLoRA不仅展示了实证性能优势，还突显了生物结构如何启发AI技术创新，为参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

TL;DR: RPEL是一种无需中央服务器的鲁棒协作机器学习方法，通过基于拉取的流行病通信策略，在保持收敛保证的同时显著降低通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作机器学习中对抗行为的容忍问题，现有方法要么依赖中央服务器，要么通信成本过高。

Method: 使用基于拉取的流行病通信策略，从少量随机节点子集拉取模型参数，通信复杂度从O(n²)降低到O(n log n)。

Result: 实证结果表明RPEL在对抗环境下保持鲁棒性，达到全对全通信的准确率，并在大规模网络中高效扩展。

Conclusion: RPEL提供了一种可扩展的鲁棒协作学习方法，无需中央服务器且通信效率高，适用于大规模分布式环境。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning is challenged by training-time adversarial
behaviors. Existing approaches to tolerate such behaviors either rely on a
central server or induce high communication costs. We propose Robust Pull-based
Epidemic Learning (RPEL), a novel, scalable collaborative approach to ensure
robust learning despite adversaries. RPEL does not rely on any central server
and, unlike traditional methods, where communication costs grow in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with the number of nodes $n$, RPEL employs a pull-based
epidemic-based communication strategy that scales in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$.
By pulling model parameters from small random subsets of nodes, RPEL
significantly lowers the number of required messages without compromising
convergence guarantees, which hold with high probability. Empirical results
demonstrate that RPEL maintains robustness in adversarial settings, competes
with all-to-all communication accuracy, and scales efficiently across large
networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于困惑度正则化的新型泛化边界，用于数据稀缺情况下的提示优化，通过引入数据或分布相关的困惑度作为有效先验来改善提示泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于PAC-Bayes理论的泛化边界仅在数据丰富时有效，无法解释实践中在少量任务特定数据下提示工程的成功。本文旨在通过困惑度作为先验来更全面地解释这种成功。

Method: 推导了新型泛化边界，通过困惑度正则化限制探索空间，使用数据或分布相关的困惑度作为有效先验来收紧边界。

Result: 理论分析表明困惑度正则化能收紧泛化边界，实证研究验证了边界的有效性以及困惑度正则化在改善提示泛化方面的实际益处。

Conclusion: 困惑度作为有效先验能够解释提示工程在数据稀缺情况下的成功，通过困惑度正则化可以改善提示泛化性能，并为数据稀缺场景下的提示优化提供理论支持。

Abstract: Many prompt engineering techniques have been successful in practice, even
when optimizing over a large prompt space with with a small amount of
task-specific data. Recent work has partially explained this success by showing
generalization bounds which apply PAC-Bayes theory to the discrete prompt
space, but they are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios. We argue that such
widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully
considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an
effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more
``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that
are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors,
formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by
limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness
and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt
generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Learning to Ask (LtA)框架，通过两阶段模型架构和最优查询策略，在分类任务中更灵活地整合专家输入，超越了传统的Learning to Defer方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Learning to Defer方法将人类和ML模型视为互斥决策者，限制了专家贡献仅为预测结果，需要更灵活的人类-AI协作框架。

Method: 基于两阶段架构：标准ML模型和增强模型（训练时包含专家反馈），设计最优查询策略。提供顺序训练和联合训练两种实现方式，后者设计了具有可实现一致性保证的代理损失函数。

Result: 在合成和真实专家数据上的实验表明，LtA为有效的人类-AI协作提供了更灵活和强大的基础。

Conclusion: LtA框架能够处理何时以及如何整合专家输入的问题，相比传统方法提供了更全面的人类-AI协作解决方案。

Abstract: Developing decision-support systems that complement human performance in
classification tasks remains an open challenge. A popular approach, Learning to
Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a
human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive
decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To
address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that
handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is
based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model
trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy
for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical
implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in
stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the
latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our
experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a
more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: ClauseLens是一个基于条款的强化学习框架，用于生成透明、合规且风险感知的再保险条约报价，显著减少违规并提高风险表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前再保险条约报价实践不透明且难以审计，需要满足严格的监管标准。

Method: 将报价任务建模为风险感知约束马尔可夫决策过程(RA-CMDP)，从法律和承保语料库中检索条款，嵌入到智能体观察中，用于约束可行动作并生成基于条款的自然语言解释。

Result: 在多智能体条约模拟器中评估，ClauseLens减少偿付能力违规51%，尾部风险表现提高27.9%(CVaR_0.10)，基于条款的解释准确率达88.2%，检索精确率87.4%，召回率91.1%。

Conclusion: 将法律背景嵌入决策和解释路径可以产生可解释、可审计且符合监管要求的报价行为，与Solvency II、NAIC RBC和欧盟AI法案保持一致。

Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet
current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce
ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces
transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov
Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from
legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and
used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural
language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,
ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance
by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded
explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision
and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and
regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and
the EU AI Act.

TL;DR: xRouter是一个基于工具调用的路由系统，通过强化学习训练智能路由器，在成本与性能之间实现优化平衡，无需手动设计路由规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM部署面临成本与性能的权衡：优质模型推理能力强但昂贵，轻量模型经济但处理复杂任务能力弱。静态升级规则和关键词启发式方法无法充分利用这一频谱，也无法跨任务类型适应。

Method: 使用强化学习端到端训练路由器，采用明确的成本感知奖励函数编码成本-性能权衡。路由器可以直接回答问题或调用外部模型，包含完整的强化学习框架、奖励和成本核算以及部署评估流程。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，xRouter实现了强大的成本-性能权衡（例如在可比较的任务完成率下显著降低成本），并提供了关于学习路由可靠帮助因素的实证见解。

Conclusion: xRouter作为实用的学习型、成本感知LLM编排基础，其发现和开源实现有望推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

Conclusion: 系列-符号数据生成和预训练机制在克服数据稀缺和提升任务性能方面具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance
continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system
theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the
unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with
corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with
strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation
model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information.
\texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA
tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models
pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of
series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data
scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at

Motivation: 预训练掩码扩散模型的性能受限于其采样过程，该过程决策不可逆且在低步数生成场景下表现不佳。

Method: 采用星形范式重新制定生成过程，允许错误修正；引入可学习的重掩码调度器，智能识别和修正可能错误；仅需对单一层进行轻量级微调。

Result: 在文本和代码生成任务上的综合实验表明，该采样算法优于或匹配现有方法，特别是在小步数采样时带来显著质量提升。

Conclusion: 提出的采样算法通过可逆决策和智能错误修正机制，有效解决了掩码扩散模型在低步数生成时的性能限制问题。

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained masked diffusion models is often constrained
by their sampling procedure, which makes decisions irreversible and struggles
in low-step generation regimes. We introduce a novel sampling algorithm that
works with pre-trained models and, after a lightweight fine-tuning of a single
layer, significantly improves sample quality and efficiency. Our method
reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which
inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we
augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies
and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost,
particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate
key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios.
In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling
algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.

Motivation: GNNs在消息传递过程中存在过度压缩问题，即来自大感受野的节点信息被压缩到固定大小的向量中，造成信息瓶颈。作者希望从模型存储和检索容量的角度重新研究这一问题。

Method: 作者分析了现有衡量过度压缩任务的局限性，提出了新的合成任务来证明信息瓶颈问题，并借鉴序列建模中的关联记忆、快速权重编程和xLSTM模型思想，开发了具有改进容量的新型GNN架构。

Conclusion: 通过重新定义过度压缩问题并借鉴序列建模的先进技术，可以开发出具有更好存储和检索容量的GNN架构，有效解决信息瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit
information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism.
While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to
suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of
node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting
in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing
phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we
define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's
representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing
tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to
demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity.
Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on
associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a
novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong
performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well
as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

Motivation: 对比学习在自监督表征学习中表现出潜力，但在资源受限设备上的部署研究不足，面临计算需求大、能耗高、数据可用性和内存使用等挑战。

Method: 系统评估了SimCLR、MoCo、SimSiam和Barlow Twins四种CL框架，采用包含能耗分析和减少训练数据条件的基准测试策略，并评估了轻量级神经网络架构与CL框架的配对。

Result: 研究发现SimCLR在不同数据条件下能耗最低，与普遍认知相反；轻量级架构与CL框架的配对分析为边缘部署提供了实用见解。

Conclusion: 本研究为在计算能力有限的边缘/雾环境中部署对比学习提供了资源影响分析，并为其未来优化开辟了多个研究方向。

Abstract: While contrastive learning (CL) shows considerable promise in self-supervised
representation learning, its deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
largely underexplored. The substantial computational demands required for
training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in
terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an
evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow
Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge
and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that
includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings
reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates
the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also
extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired
with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource
implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing
capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于九维积分签名的激活函数分类框架，结合高斯传播统计、渐近斜率和正则性度量，为激活函数选择提供理论指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活函数比较大多基于启发式方法，缺乏严格的分类框架来指导神经网络中激活函数的选择和设计。

Method: 构建九维积分签名S_sigma(phi)，包含高斯传播统计(m1,g1,g2,m2,eta)、渐近斜率(alpha_plus,alpha_minus)和正则性度量(TV(phi'),C(phi))，建立重参数化定律和闭包性质。

Result: 对八种标准激活函数进行了分类，证明了饱和型、线性增长型和平滑型激活函数之间的明显区别，数值验证支持理论预测。

Conclusion: 该框架将激活函数选择从试错方法转变为可证明的稳定性和核条件化，为激活函数设计提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: Activation functions govern the expressivity and stability of neural
networks, yet existing comparisons remain largely heuristic. We propose a
rigorous framework for their classification via a nine-dimensional integral
signature S_sigma(phi), combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2,
m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures
(TV(phi'), C(phi)). This taxonomy establishes well-posedness, affine
reparameterization laws with bias, and closure under bounded slope variation.
Dynamical analysis yields Lyapunov theorems with explicit descent constants and
identifies variance stability regions through (m2', g2). From a kernel
perspective, we derive dimension-free Hessian bounds and connect smoothness to
bounded variation of phi'. Applying the framework, we classify eight standard
activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving
sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families.
Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical
predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving
activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel
conditioning.

Conclusion: 针对特定生物结构的超分辨率评估需要采用生物学驱动的分析方法，而非通用的图像质量评估指标，这对牙本质孔隙网络的准确可视化具有重要意义。

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO等强化学习方法在扩散模型中应用困难，因为最有效的扩散采样器基于确定性ODE，而GRPO需要随机策略。现有方法使用低效的SDE采样器引入随机性，但收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO)，这是一种新的在线RL算法，完全摒弃策略梯度框架，直接从组级偏好中学习，利用组内样本的相对信息。

Result: DGPO训练速度比现有最先进方法快约20倍，在领域内和领域外奖励指标上均取得更优性能。

Conclusion: DGPO通过直接学习组级偏好，解决了扩散模型中强化学习的效率问题，实现了快速训练和优越性能。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统视频摘要方法忽略任务的主观性，确定性地回归到多个标注者的平均帧分数，无法反映不同人类视角的多样性。

Method: 采用扩散模型，将视频摘要作为条件生成任务，模型学习良好摘要的分布，根据输入视频动态适应视觉上下文并生成多个候选摘要。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，生成的摘要与个体标注者偏好更接近，并通过背包问题分析提供新的评估指标。

Conclusion: SummDiff不仅性能优越，还能生成更符合人类主观偏好的多样化摘要，为视频摘要任务提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Video summarization is a task of shortening a video by choosing a subset of
frames while preserving its essential moments. Despite the innate subjectivity
of the task, previous works have deterministically regressed to an averaged
frame score over multiple raters, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of what
constitutes a good summary. We propose a novel problem formulation by framing
video summarization as a conditional generation task, allowing a model to learn
the distribution of good summaries and to generate multiple plausible summaries
that better reflect varying human perspectives. Adopting diffusion models for
the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff,
dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate
summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various
benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual
annotator preferences. Moreover, we provide a deeper insight with novel metrics
from an analysis of the knapsack, which is an important last step of generating
summaries but has been overlooked in evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法受限于预定义的相似性度量，无法灵活捕捉输入之间的复杂关系，而LLM的注意力机制为此提供了新的可能性。

Method: 使用预训练LLM的注意力矩阵进行谱聚类，并通过Next Token Prediction损失对数字和图像数据进行微调，支持文本条件图像聚类。

Result: LLM在文本编码数字数据上表现出令人印象深刻的零样本聚类能力，注意力矩阵显示明显的聚类模式，谱聚类性能具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该工作将上下文学习扩展到无监督设置，展示了LLM在聚类任务中的有效性和灵活性。

Abstract: We propose In-Context Clustering (ICC), a flexible LLM-based procedure for
clustering data from diverse distributions. Unlike traditional clustering
algorithms constrained by predefined similarity measures, ICC flexibly captures
complex relationships among inputs through an attention mechanism. We show that
pretrained LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot clustering capabilities on
text-encoded numeric data, with attention matrices showing salient cluster
patterns. Spectral clustering using attention matrices offers surprisingly
competitive performance. We further enhance the clustering capabilities of LLMs

TL;DR: 提出了UML：不配对多模态学习器，一种模态无关的训练范式，通过共享参数交替处理不同模态的输入，利用未配对的辅助多模态数据提升目标模态的表征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态学习严重依赖配对数据集，但能否利用未配对的辅助多模态数据直接增强目标模态的表征学习是一个被忽视但具有潜力的问题。

Method: 采用模态无关的训练范式，单个模型通过共享参数交替处理不同模态的输入，利用不同模态是共享底层现实投影的假设，无需显式配对即可从跨模态结构中获益。

Result: 理论上在线性数据生成假设下，未配对辅助数据能产生比单模态训练更丰富的信息表征；实证表明使用文本、音频或图像等未配对辅助模态数据能持续提升图像和音频等单模态目标的下游性能。

Conclusion: UML展示了未配对多模态数据在增强单模态表征学习方面的有效性，为利用丰富但未配对的跨模态数据提供了新途径。

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分布式机器学习批量大小选择方法依赖静态分配或简单启发式规则，无法适应异构动态计算环境，需要更智能的自适应方案。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，使用PPO算法，构建包含网络指标、系统资源利用率和训练统计效率指标的多维状态表示，实现无需显式系统建模的批量大小优化。

Result: 在多样化工作负载、硬件配置和网络条件下，DYNAMIX实现了最终模型精度提升6.3%，总训练时间减少46%，在32节点集群上保持最佳性能，且学习策略能有效迁移到相关模型架构。

Conclusion: DYNAMIX证明了强化学习在分布式训练批量大小优化中的有效性，能够自适应异构环境，显著提升训练效率和模型质量，具有良好的可扩展性和策略迁移能力。

Abstract: Existing batch size selection approaches in dis- tributed machine learning
rely on static allocation or simplistic heuristics that fail to adapt to
heterogeneous, dynamic computing environments. We present DYNAMIX, a
reinforcement learning framework that formulates batch size optimization as a
sequen- tial decision-making problem using Proximal Policy Optimiza- tion
(PPO). Our approach employs a multi-dimensional state representation
encompassing network-level metrics, system-level resource utilization, and
training statistical efficiency indicators to enable informed decision-making
across diverse computational resources. Our approach eliminates the need for
explicit system modeling while integrating seamlessly with existing distributed
training frameworks. Through evaluations across diverse work- loads, hardware
configurations, and network conditions, DY- NAMIX achieves up to 6.3%
improvement in the final model accuracy and 46% reduction in the total training
time. Our scalability experiments demonstrate that DYNAMIX maintains the best
performance as cluster size increases to 32 nodes, while policy transfer
experiments show that learned policies generalize effectively across related
model architectures.

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在寻找最优策略时通常忽略学习策略的特性，难以描述将学习哪些策略及其行为。

Method: 使用熵正则化和温度解耦策略，通过逐渐减小正则化温度来保证收敛到特定的最优策略。

Result: 该方法能够实现可解释、保持多样性的最优策略，在特定实例中，实现的最优策略会均匀采样所有最优动作。

Conclusion: 提出的温度解耦策略可以估计与可解释、保持多样性的最优策略相关的回报分布，达到任意精度。

Abstract: In the pursuit of finding an optimal policy, reinforcement learning (RL)
methods generally ignore the properties of learned policies apart from their
expected return. Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize
which policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present
a theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to
a particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a
temperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes
and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and
return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the
realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our
temperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to
arbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了GDPO算法，通过半确定性蒙特卡洛方案降低ELBO估计器的方差，解决了扩散语言模型强化学习微调中的似然评估难题，在数学、推理和编码任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型具有并行生成和迭代优化的优势，但难以进行强化学习微调，因为其似然难以计算。现有方法如diffu-GRPO存在严重偏差，而基于ELBO的方法虽然数学基础更严谨，但计算成本过高。

Method: 提出了Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO)算法，通过分析ELBO估计的方差来源，采用半确定性蒙特卡洛方案在关键维度上进行快速确定性积分近似，有效降低方差。

Result: GDPO在数学、推理和编码基准测试中，相比预训练检查点取得一致提升，并在大多数任务上优于当前最先进的diffu-GRPO基线方法。

Conclusion: GDPO通过降低ELBO估计器的方差，为扩散语言模型的强化学习微调提供了有效的解决方案，证明了在有限评估预算下实现更低方差估计的可行性。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation
with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive
large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable
likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level
likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this
approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in
sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a
surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods
have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood
evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its
sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through
fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.
Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages
simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the
variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo
sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation
budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained
checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,
on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为Linearizer的架构，通过在两个可逆神经网络之间夹入线性算子，使得非线性函数在特定向量空间中表现为线性，从而将线性代数工具应用于非线性映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络本质上是非线性的，但线性性是相对于向量空间对定义的。本文旨在识别非标准向量空间，使得传统非线性函数在其中表现为线性。

Method: 提出Linearizer架构：f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A g_x(x))，其中g_x和g_y是可逆神经网络，A是线性算子。通过构造新的向量空间，使非线性映射线性化。

Result: 该框架使SVD、伪逆、正交投影等线性代数工具可应用于非线性映射。两个共享神经网络的Linearizer组合仍为Linearizer，可将扩散模型的数百步采样压缩为单步。

Conclusion: Linearizer框架成功将线性代数工具扩展到非线性映射，在扩散模型采样、投影生成模型和模块化风格迁移等任务中展现出强大能力。

Abstract: Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined
relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\to$$Y$. Is it possible to
identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally
nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that
makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich
a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A
g_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly
defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this
kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of
linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,
applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of
two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage
this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our
architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.
We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)
on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to
demonstrate modular style transfer.

Result: 得到了一维特殊情形的显式解，证明了最优轨迹映射在C1拓扑下的闭性，并由此推导出动力学平均场博弈中松弛均衡的存在性。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有加速度控制和状态约束的最优控制问题提供了理论分析框架，并在平均场博弈中得到了应用，证明了松弛均衡的存在性。

Abstract: Relying on the careful study of a related problem in the calculus of
variations, we study a class of optimal control problems in which the control
lies on the acceleration, with state constraints on the position variable. In
dimension one, we find explicit formulas in the special case when the running
cost is a power of the acceleration (in absolute value) and the terminal cost
is zero. For more general costs or/and higher dimensions, we study the
singularities of the value function. We also prove the closedness (in the C 1
topology) of the graph of the multivalued mapping which maps a point in the
state space to the set of optimal trajectories which start from this point. A
consequence of the latter is the existence, under general assumptions, of
relaxed equilibria for a class of kinetic mean field games with state
constraints.

Abstract: Pumped storage hydro (PSH) plants can improve the flexibility of power
systems. A well-designed formulation for a PSH model is essential when
incorporating the PSH units into a day-ahead unit commitment model. In the
literature, the formulation of a PSH model is generally based on the individual
PSH unit. This formulation is tight if there is only one PSH unit in the
reservoir. However, when there are multiple units sharing the same reservoir in
a PSH plant, the existing formulation may introduce some symmetric structures
which degrade the efficiency of a mixed-integer programming solver
significantly. In this paper, to cope with the symmetric structure in the PSH
plants that have multiple units, we propose two new formulations. The first
formulation considers the case in which there are multiple identical units
sharing the same reservoir. The second formulation considers a general case in
which the units sharing the same reservoir have the same generating and pumping
efficiency. Using the new formulations, the symmetric structures in the problem
can be effectively broken. Numerical results are presented to study the
computational efficiency of the new formulations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了改进的价格调整过程来解决传统tâtonnement方法在Fisher市场中收敛慢的问题，开发了加速价格调整方法(APM)和恢复机制，实现了更快的收敛速度和精确竞争均衡价格的计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的tâtonnement价格调整过程在Fisher市场中通常无法精确收敛到竞争均衡，且需要较高的迭代复杂度来计算近似竞争均衡价格。

Method: 通过将寻找Fisher市场竞争均衡的问题建模为强凸非光滑最小化问题，开发了加速价格调整方法(APM)，并结合恢复机制将近似均衡价格映射到精确均衡价格。

Result: APM方法在$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$轻量级迭代中找到$\epsilon$-竞争均衡价格，显著优于传统方法。结合恢复机制，实现了在有限步内收敛到精确竞争均衡价格。

Conclusion: 这是在线性和拟线性Fisher市场中价格调整方法首次获得精确收敛保证，为高效轻量级计算竞争均衡价格开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The canonical price-adjustment process, t\^atonnement, typically fails to
converge to the exact competitive equilibrium (CE) and requires a high
iteration complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$ to compute
$\epsilon$-CE prices in widely studied linear and quasi-linear Fisher markets.
This paper proposes refined price-adjustment processes to overcome these
limitations. By formulating the task of finding CE of a (quasi-)linear Fisher
market as a strongly convex nonsmooth minimization problem, we develop a novel
accelerated price-adjustment method (APM) that finds an $\epsilon$-CE price in
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ lightweight iterations, which
significantly improves upon the iteration complexities of t\^atonnement
methods. Furthermore, through our new formulation, we construct a recovery
oracle that maps approximate CE prices to exact CE prices at a low
computational cost. By coupling this recovery oracle with APM, we obtain an
adaptive price-adjustment method whose iterates converge to CE prices in finite
steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence guarantee to
exact CE for price-adjustment methods in linear and quasi-linear Fisher
markets. Our developments pave the way for efficient lightweight computation of
CE prices. We also present numerical results to demonstrate the fast
convergence of the proposed methods and the efficient recovery of CE prices.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified stochastic optimal control framework that
bridges time-optimal control problems and classical stochastic optimal control
problems. Unlike traditional deterministic time-optimal control formulations,
our framework incorporates a generalized stochastic control structure under
minimum-time constraints. Here, the minimum-time condition characterizes the
earliest achievable moment for reaching a target state in expectation,
rendering the terminal time an endogenous control-dependent variable. The main
contributions of this study are: deriving an extended stochastic maximum
principle for the proposed model, and establishing a bang-bang type optimal
control for the linear time-optimal control problem. This unified stochastic
optimal control framework enables optimal strategy design across finance,
autonomous systems, and supply chains by simultaneously minimizing operational
costs and achieving statistically-defined targets at the earliest feasible
time.

Abstract: Battery swapping stations (BSS) offer a fast and scalable alternative to
conventional electric vehicle (EV) charging, gaining growing policy support
worldwide. However, existing BSS control strategies typically rely on
heuristics or low-fidelity degradation models, limiting profitability and
service level. This paper proposes BSS-MPC: a real-time, degradation-aware
Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for BSS operations to trade off
economic incentives from energy market arbitrage and long-term battery
degradation effects. BSS-MPC integrates a high-fidelity, physics informed
battery aging model that accurately predicts the degradation level and the
remaining capacity of battery packs. The resulting multiscale
optimization-jointly considering energy arbitrage, swapping logistics, and
battery health-is formulated as a mixed-integer optimal control problem and
solved with tailored algorithms. Simulation results show that BSS-MPC
outperforms rule-based and low-fidelity baselines, achieving lower energy cost,
reduced capacity fade, and strict satisfaction of EV swapping demands.

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段算法结合专用预条件策略，有效解决了大规模KQR的计算瓶颈，实现了高效可扩展的求解

Abstract: Kernel Quantile Regression (KQR) extends classical quantile regression to
nonlinear settings using kernel methods, offering powerful tools for modeling
conditional distributions. However, its application to large-scale datasets is
severely limited by the computational burden of the large, dense kernel matrix
and the need to efficiently solve large, often ill-conditioned linear systems.
Existing state-of-the-art solvers usually struggle with scalability. In this
paper, we propose a novel and highly efficient two-phase optimization algorithm
tailored for large-scale KQR. In the first phase, we employ an inexact
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to compute a high-quality
warm-start solution. The second phase refines this solution using an efficient
semismooth Newton augmented Lagrangian method (ALM). A key innovation of our
approach is a specialized preconditioning strategy that leverages low-rank
approximations of the kernel matrix to effectively mitigate the
ill-conditioning of the linear systems in the Newton steps of the ALM. This can
significantly accelerate iterative solvers for linear systems. Extensive
numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm substantially outperforms
existing state-of-the-art commercial and specialized KQR solvers in terms of
speed and scalability.

Motivation: 现有张量方法在使用有限差分近似时维度依赖较差，需要开发更高效的算法来减少高阶导数计算成本。

Method: 使用有限差分近似p阶导数，每个近似重用m次迭代后才重新计算，通过参数m控制计算效率。

Result: 获得(p-1)阶自适应方法，迭代复杂度为O(ε^-(p+1)/p)，当m=(p-1)n+1时，oracle调用复杂度为O(n^(1/p)ε^-(p+1)/p)。

Conclusion: 该方法在维度依赖上改进了现有张量方法使用有限差分近似的已知界限，提供了更高效的优化算法。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a method for minimizing non-convex functions with
Lipschitz continuous $p$th-order derivatives, starting from $p \geq 1$. The
method, however, only requires derivative information up to order $(p-1)$,
since the $p$th-order derivatives are approximated via finite differences. To
ensure oracle efficiency, instead of computing finite-difference approximations
at every iteration, we reuse each approximation for $m$ consecutive iterations
before recomputing it, with $m \geq 1$ as a key parameter. As a result, we
obtain an adaptive method of order $(p-1)$ that requires no more than
$O(\epsilon^{-\frac{p+1}{p}})$ iterations to find an $\epsilon$-approximate
stationary point of the objective function and that, for the choice $m=(p-1)n +
1$, where $n$ is the problem dimension, takes no more than
$O(n^{1/p}\epsilon^{-\frac{p+1}{p}})$ oracle calls of order $(p-1)$. This
improves previously known bounds for tensor methods with finite-difference
approximations in terms of the problem dimension.

Conclusion: 建立了p-Laplacian特征值比值优化问题的理论框架，揭示了不同约束条件下问题的本质差异，并提出了值得进一步研究的问题。

Abstract: In this paper we consider the scale invariant shape functional
$${\mathcal{F}}_{p,q}(\Omega)=\frac{\lambda_p^{1/p}(\Omega)}{\lambda_q^{1/q}(\Omega)},$$
where $1\le q<p\le+\infty$ and $\lambda_p(\Omega)$ (respectively
$\lambda_q(\Omega)$) is the first eigenvalue of the $p$-Laplacian $-\Delta_p$
(respectively $-\Delta_q$) with Dirichlet boundary condition on
$\partial\Omega$. We study both the maximization and minimization problems for
${\mathcal{F}}_{p,q}$, and show the existence of optimal domains in
${\mathbb{R}}^d$, along with some of their qualitative properties.
Surprisingly, the case of a bounded box $D$ constraint
$$\max\Big\{\lambda_q(\Omega)\ :\ \Omega\subset D,\
\lambda_p(\Omega)=1\Big\},$$ leads to a problem of different nature, for which
the existence of a solution is shown by analyzing optimal capacitary measures.
In the last section we list some interesting questions that, in our opinion,
deserve to be investigated.

Method: 通过凸成本惩罚交易增量，证明摩擦单调性原理，建立强对偶性、动态规划恒等式，分析最优耦合在扰动下的稳定性。

Result: 最优耦合在活跃分量上具有双原子分解，出现无交易区间的交易带，在消失摩擦极限下收敛到无摩擦左窗帘耦合，对线性二次摩擦获得显式解。

Conclusion: 结果为多边际稳健定价提供了统一的分析、稳定性和计算基础，可应用于回溯、障碍和亚式期权的模型无关定价/超对冲。

Abstract: We study martingale optimal transport (MOT) with state-dependent trading
frictions and develop a geometric-duality framework that extends from one
time-step to the multi-marginal setting. Building on the frictionless
left-monotone structure (Beiglb\"ock and Juillet, Ann. Probab. 2016;
Henry-Labord\`ere and Touzi, Finance Stoch. 2016; Beiglb\"ock et al, Ann.
Probab. 2017), we penalize trade increments by a convex cost and prove a
frictional monotonicity principle. Optimal couplings admit bi-atomic
disintegrations on active components, while a trade band emerges as a
no-transaction region where the identity coupling is optimal. The band is
characterized in dual variables by a subgradient condition at the origin; off
the band, transport moves along two monotone graphs whose endpoints solve an
equal-slope system balancing continuation values and marginal trading costs.
  We establish strong duality with attainment for state-dependent frictions, a
dynamic programming identity that aggregates the one time-step problem, and
stability of optimal couplings and endpoints under perturbations of marginals
and friction. In the vanishing-friction limit the transport maps converge to
the frictionless left-curtain coupling. For linear-quadratic frictions,
motivated by spread and transient impact (Almgren and Chriss, J. Risk 2001;
Obizhaeva and Wang, J. Financ. Mark. 2013), we obtain explicit off-band
displacements and comparative statics in liquidity parameters. Applications
include model-independent pricing/superhedging of lookback, barrier, and Asian
options. Overall, the results link robust superhedging duality (Beiglb\"ock et
al, Finance Stoch. 2013; Dolinsky and Soner, Finance Stoch. 2014) with the fine
geometry of frictional MOT, providing a unified basis for analysis, stability,
and computation in multi-marginal robust pricing.

Abstract: We propose a composite Lyapunov framework for nonlinear autonomous systems
that ensures strict decay through a pair of differential inequalities. The
approach yields integral estimates, quantitative convergence rates, vanishing
of dissipation measures, convergence to a critical set, and semistability under
mild conditions, without relying on invariance principles or compactness
assumptions. The framework unifies convergence to points and sets and is
illustrated through applications to inertial gradient systems and Primal--Dual
gradient flows.
