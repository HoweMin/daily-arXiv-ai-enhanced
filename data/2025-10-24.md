### [1] [Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19861)
*Felix Michalak,Steven Abreu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在混合SSM-Transformer架构中，自注意力层专门负责检索任务，而SSM层无法补偿注意力缺失。仅保留15%的注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留84%的MMLU表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究混合SSM-Transformer架构中不同组件的功能专门化程度，挑战关于混合架构冗余性的假设。

Method: 通过对RecurrentGemma-2B/9B和Jamba-Mini-1.6模型进行注意力消融实验，分析自注意力层和SSM层在检索任务中的功能分离。

Result: 注意力消融导致检索任务完全失败（0%准确率），而SSM层无补偿机制。仅保留15%注意力头即可维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留84%的MMLU表现。

Conclusion: 混合架构中的自注意力层专门负责检索任务，这些模型作为专门化模块而非集成系统运行，对架构优化和可解释性有重要影响。

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

### [2] [An Integrated Approach to Neural Architecture Search for Deep Q-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19872)
*Iman Rahmani,Saman Yazdannik,Morteza Tayefi,Jafar Roshanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAS-DQN将神经架构搜索集成到深度强化学习训练中，通过动态网络重构实现自适应架构优化，在连续控制任务中优于固定架构设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习代理的性能受限于固定的神经网络架构，需要通过昂贵的超参数搜索确定，这限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入NAS-DQN代理，将学习的神经架构搜索控制器直接集成到DRL训练循环中，基于累积性能反馈实现动态网络重配置。

Result: NAS-DQN在最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性方面均优于固定架构基线，且计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 架构自适应对于在线深度强化学习的最优样本效率不仅是有益的，而且是必要的，RL代理设计可以无缝集成为学习过程的动态组件。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

### [3] [From Large to Small: Transferring CUDA Optimization Expertise via Reasoning Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19873)
*Junfeng Gong,Zhiyi Wei,Junying Chen,Cheng Liu,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGraphT是一个无需训练、基于检索增强生成的框架，通过构建CUDA优化轨迹推理图，将LLM级推理能力转移到小型模型上，使SLM在CUDA代码生成任务中接近LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用LLM生成优化CUDA代码面临两大挑战：云API存在代码泄露风险，本地部署计算成本高且效率低。虽然SLM更轻量且隐私友好，但其有限推理能力在复杂CUDA生成任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出ReGraphT框架，将CUDA优化轨迹组织为结构化推理图，将组合优化建模为状态转换，利用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索。

Result: 实验显示ReGraphT优于HPC专用微调模型和其他检索增强方法，在CUDAEval和ParEval上平均加速2.33倍。与DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct和Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct配合时，SLM可接近LLM级性能。

Conclusion: ReGraphT成功将LLM级推理能力转移到SLM，解决了隐私风险和计算开销问题，为高效CUDA代码生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

### [4] [From Optimization to Prediction: Transformer-Based Path-Flow Estimation to the Traffic Assignment Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19889)
*Mostafa Ameli,Van Anh Le,Sulthana Shams,Alexander Skabardonis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer架构的深度学习模型，直接预测均衡路径流量，大幅降低计算时间并适应需求变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通分配问题在大规模网络中计算复杂度呈非线性增长，计算成本高昂，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用Transformer神经网络架构，直接从OD对预测均衡路径流量，捕捉OD对间的复杂相关性。

Result: 在多个网络上验证，比传统优化方法快数个数量级，计算成本降低，预测精度提高，能灵活适应需求变化。

Conclusion: 该数据驱动方法为交通管理提供快速"假设分析"能力，支持交通规划和政策制定。

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

### [5] [FairGRPO: Fair Reinforcement Learning for Equitable Clinical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19893)
*Shiqi Dai,Wei Dai,Jiaee Cheong,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairGRPO是一种分层强化学习方法，通过自适应重要性加权和潜在人口统计群体发现，显著减少医疗AI系统在人口群体间的性能差异，同时提高诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI系统在诊断能力上表现出色，但在不同人口群体间存在显著的性能差异，这对代表性不足的群体造成实际伤害。现有的多模态推理基础模型通过强化学习训练时会继承并放大训练数据中的偏见。

Method: FairGRPO采用分层强化学习方法，基于表征、任务难度和数据源对优势进行自适应重要性加权。当缺乏人口统计标签时，使用无监督聚类自动发现潜在的人口群体。

Result: 在7个临床诊断数据集上的实验显示，FairGRPO将预测公平性提高了27.2%，同时F1分数提高了12.49%。训练动态分析表明FairGRPO在整个优化过程中持续改善公平性。

Conclusion: FairGRPO有效解决了医疗AI中的公平性问题，发布的FairMedGemma-4B模型在保持最先进性能的同时显著减少了人口群体间的差异。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

### [6] [Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy for Urinary Tract Disease through Explainable SHAP-Guided Feature Selection and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19896)
*Filipe Ferreira de Oliveira,Matheus Becali Rocha,Renato A. Krohling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用基于SHAP的特征选择方法来提高膀胱癌诊断预测模型的透明度和效果，通过XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost算法开发了六个二元分类场景，在保持或改善性能指标的同时优化特征选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统，优化泌尿系统疾病的筛查和早期诊断，特别是膀胱癌。

Method: 采用XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost算法，使用Optuna进行超参数优化，SMOTE技术进行类别平衡，并通过SHAP进行特征选择。

Result: 基于SHAP的特征选择方法被证明是有效的，能够在保持或改善平衡准确率、精确度和特异性等性能指标的同时优化预测变量选择。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有助于开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统，优化泌尿系统疾病的筛查和早期诊断。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

### [7] [FINDER: Feature Inference on Noisy Datasets using Eigenspace Residuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19917)
*Trajan Murphy,Akshunna S. Dogra,Hanfeng Gu,Caleb Meredith,Mark Kon,Julio Enrique Castrillion-Candas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FINDER是一个针对噪声数据集的分类框架，通过随机特征和KLE分解将数据集视为随机场实现，在特征学习和推理阶段结合随机分析来处理数据随机性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理噪声数据集（低信噪比、小样本量、数据收集错误等）是分类方法的重要研究前沿，具有理论和实践意义。

Method: 将经验数据集视为底层随机场的实现，映射到适当的希尔伯特空间构造随机特征，通过Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève展开分解为可计算不可约分量，通过特征分解进行噪声数据分类。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病分期分类和遥感森林砍伐检测等数据稀缺的科学领域取得了最先进的突破。

Conclusion: 讨论了FINDER优于现有方法的情况、失效模式和其他局限性。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

### [8] [Beyond the Ideal: Analyzing the Inexact Muon Update](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19933)
*Egor Shulgin,Sultan AlRashed,Francesco Orabona,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次分析了Muon优化器中近似正交化更新的理论性能，揭示了近似误差与最优步长和动量参数之间的耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在实践中依赖快速近似正交化，但现有理论分析都基于计算不可行的精确SVD更新，存在理论与实践的脱节。

Method: 在线性最小化预言机框架下，引入加性误差模型来捕捉实际近似方案的不精确性，分析近似正交化更新的性能边界。

Result: 分析表明近似误差与最优步长和动量参数存在耦合：较低的预言机精度需要更小的步长但更大的动量参数。NanoGPT实验验证了这一预测。

Conclusion: 近似过程（如牛顿-舒尔茨步数）应从实现细节提升为必须与学习计划协同调优的关键参数。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

### [9] [Mitigating Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Decentralized Federated Learning via $f$-Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19934)
*Xiang Li,Buxin Su,Chendi Wang,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算量化问题，提出了两种基于f-差分隐私的隐私核算方法，能够更准确地捕捉稀疏通信、本地迭代和相关性噪声带来的隐私放大效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习允许用户在不与中央服务器共享数据的情况下协作，但由于复杂的算法组件（如去中心化通信和本地更新），准确量化隐私预算具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了两种新的f-DP核算方法：PN-f-DP（量化随机游走通信下用户对之间的隐私泄露）和Sec-f-LDP（通过共享秘密支持结构化噪声注入），结合f-DP理论和马尔可夫链集中性工具。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，与基于Rényi DP的方法相比，我们的方法能产生更紧的(ε,δ)边界和更好的效用。

Conclusion: f-DP在去中心化隐私核算中具有优势，能够更准确地量化隐私保护水平。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

*Matan Tsipory,Ran Levinstein,Itay Evron,Mark Kong,Deanna Needell,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了持续学习中任务排序对线性回归性能的影响，重点关注贪婪最大化任务间差异性的排序策略，并与随机排序进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究任务排序在持续学习中的影响，特别是贪婪最大化任务间差异性的排序策略，这在先前工作中虽有提及但仍存在许多未解问题。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法文献中的工具，形式化贪婪排序策略，并开发几何和代数直觉。在线性回归和CIFAR-100分类任务上进行实证分析，并在高秩和一般秩设置下进行理论分析。

Result: 实证表明贪婪排序在平均损失上比随机排序收敛更快。理论分析显示：在高秩设置下，贪婪排序与随机排序有相似的损失界；但在一般秩设置下，单次贪婪排序可能失败，而允许重复的贪婪排序以O(1/∛k)速率收敛。

Conclusion: 揭示了贪婪排序和随机排序之间的细微差别，贪婪排序在特定条件下表现更好，但单次排序存在失败风险，而允许重复的排序策略具有更好的收敛保证。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

### [11] [Robust Reinforcement Learning in Finance: Modeling Market Impact with Elliptic Uncertainty Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19950)
*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新型椭圆不确定性集合来处理金融市场中RL代理训练与部署环境不匹配问题，特别是市场影响的定向特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒RL方法依赖对称结构，无法捕捉市场影响的定向特性，导致在实时交易中性能下降。

Method: 开发椭圆不确定性集合，建立隐式和显式闭式解来计算最坏情况不确定性，实现高效鲁棒策略评估。

Result: 在单资产和多资产交易任务中，该方法获得更高的夏普比率，并在交易量增加时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融市场中的RL提供了更忠实和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于函数评估的无偏梯度估计器新方法，通过将方向导数重构为望远镜级数并使用精心设计的分布采样，解决了零阶优化中梯度估计器的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零阶优化方法存在梯度估计器偏差问题，除非扰动步长趋近于零，这限制了方法的性能和应用。

Method: 将方向导数重构为望远镜级数，通过从精心设计的分布中采样来构造无偏梯度估计器，分析了四种具体构造的理论性质并推导了最优缩放分布和扰动步长。

Result: 理论证明使用该估计器的SGD在光滑非凸目标上达到最优复杂度，在合成任务和语言模型微调实验中显示出比标准方法更优的准确性和收敛性。

Conclusion: 提出的无偏梯度估计器家族有效解决了零阶优化中的偏差问题，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

### [13] [Revisiting Zeroth-Order Optimization: Minimum-Variance Two-Point Estimators and Directionally Aligned Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19975)
*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究两点零阶梯度估计器，发现当扰动步长趋近于零时，最小化估计器渐近方差的扰动分布可以与真实梯度方向对齐，而非保持固定长度。提出了方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，并在理论和实验上验证其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注固定长度的随机扰动，但忽略了扰动方向与梯度方向对齐可能带来的优势。本文旨在探索这种方向对齐扰动在零阶优化中的潜力。

Method: 将问题表述为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题，提出了方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，该方案能自适应地在关键方向上提供更高精度。同时提供了使用δ-无偏随机扰动的随机梯度下降收敛性分析。

Result: 理论分析表明DAP方案具有优越性，在合成问题和实际任务的实证评估中，DAP在特定条件下优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 方向对齐扰动方案为零阶优化提供了新的思路，通过自适应地对齐梯度方向，在特定条件下能够获得比传统固定长度扰动方法更好的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机平滑方法主要使用各向同性噪声分布，忽略了数据维度的异质性，限制了鲁棒性认证的效果

Method: 开发UCAN框架，将现有随机平滑方法从对称噪声转换为非对称噪声分布，支持多种噪声分布和ℓp范数认证，并设计了三种噪声参数生成器来优化各向异性噪声参数

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和ImageNet数据集上，UCAN相比现有最优方法在大认证半径下认证精度提升高达182.6%

Conclusion: UCAN通过各向异性噪声有效提升了随机平滑的认证鲁棒性，为对抗性防御提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了时间序列预测中的"长序列信息增益假设"，发现适当截断历史数据反而能提高预测精度。基于信息瓶颈理论提出了AMRC方法，通过动态掩码损失和表示一致性约束来抑制冗余特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测模型基于"长序列信息增益假设"，但该研究通过实验发现这一假设存在局限性。现有模型在训练过程中会学习大量冗余特征（如噪声或不相关波动），从而影响有效信号提取。

Method: 提出AMRC方法，包含两个核心组件：1）动态掩码损失，自适应识别高区分度的时间段来指导模型训练；2）表示一致性约束，稳定输入、标签和预测之间的映射关系。

Result: 实验结果表明AMRC能有效抑制冗余特征学习，同时显著提升模型性能。该方法不仅挑战了时序建模的传统假设，还为开发高效鲁棒的预测模型提供了新的理论见解和方法突破。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了长序列信息增益假设的局限性，证明了适当截断历史数据的有效性，提出的AMRC方法为时间序列预测领域提供了新的理论框架和技术路径。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

TL;DR: MDLM在推理任务中表现与左到右解码相似，但通过推理填充和MED方法，可以发挥其训练优势，实现不确定性测量、早期退出、高质量数据生成和加速解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDLM在数学和编程任务中，任意顺序解码和多token解码的优势不明显，需要探索如何利用其训练特性来提升推理性能和数据生成能力。

Method: 提出推理填充方法，使用MDLM填充推理模板，区分推理和答案token；提出MED方法，基于条件熵自适应并行解码。

Result: 在GSM8k上，使用MDLM后验推理轨迹微调模型性能与人工推理轨迹相当；MED方法保持性能的同时减少2.7倍解码步骤。

Conclusion: MDLM的训练和计算为推理和后训练方法提供了新的可能性，包括不确定性测量、早期退出、数据生成和加速解码。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用监督学习和决策树分类器在CAD建模的平面图中分析RFID RSSI数据，对12个实验室区域进行位置推断，实现国防物资存储的异常检测和错放监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RFID跟踪在国防资产存储中的传感器特异性不足问题（如长距离检测、欺骗和伪造漏洞），避免错误检测和操作安全事件。

Method: 采用监督学习模拟，使用真实的RSSI数据和决策树分类，在CAD建模的平面图中处理类别不平衡问题，计算类别权重，并使用分层子采样平衡数据。

Result: 模型在5000个平衡观测值上训练，总体准确率为34.2%，多个区域（F、G、H等）的F1分数超过0.40，但稀有类别（特别是LabZoneC）经常被错误分类。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可以在现实模拟中应用于区域级异常检测或错放监控，通过改进天线布局、增加传感器或与其他模态的传感器融合可提高低覆盖和低信号区域的分类性能。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

TL;DR: SALT是一个轻量级框架，通过构建轨迹图提供细粒度优势分配，解决基于群体的RL算法在复杂多步任务中仅依赖稀疏结果奖励的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在单轮任务中表现出色，但在复杂多步任务中面临挑战。基于群体的RL算法如GRPO缺乏评论家模型，仅依赖稀疏结果奖励会导致训练不稳定和次优策略。

Method: 构建相同提示下的轨迹图，量化每个步骤的质量并相应分配优势。SALT作为即插即用模块，无需修改rollout过程且计算开销可忽略。

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和AppWorld基准测试中，SALT在不同模型大小下均能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: SALT通过细粒度优势分配有效解决了基于群体RL算法的训练不稳定问题，且易于集成到现有算法中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Motivation: 比特币网络虽然处理了超过10.8亿笔交易和87.2亿BTC，但由于其假名性和UTXO设计的资金流动隐蔽性，这些数据难以用于机器学习研究。

Method: 构建时序异构图模型，重建比特币资金流动，提供自定义采样方法生成节点和边特征向量，以及专门的图数据库加载和分析工具。

Conclusion: 该综合数据集和工具包赋能机器学习社区应对比特币复杂生态系统，推动异常检测、地址分类、市场分析和大规模图机器学习基准测试等应用的发展。

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08}
billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential
for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds
inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely
inaccessible for ML research. Addressing this gap, we present an ML-compatible
graph modeling the Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing the flow of
funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction
history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and
\num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding
node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze
the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use
database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML
community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in

Motivation: 时间点过程是事件序列的强大生成模型，但现有自回归模型使采样必须顺序执行，限制了效率

Method: 基于拒绝采样的算法，支持从现有TPP模型并行生成多个未来事件

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现了经验性加速，为大规模TPP应用提供了高效并行生成能力

Conclusion: 该方法在保持表达性建模的同时，实现了高效的并行生成，弥合了建模表达力和生成效率之间的差距

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

Motivation: 在线广告平台需要有效的竞价策略来最大化利润，但现有研究往往未能同时考虑广告的延迟和长期效应、累积影响（如强化或疲劳效应）以及用户异质性这三个关键因素。

Method: 将广告竞价建模为具有延迟泊松奖励的上下文马尔可夫决策过程，提出两阶段最大似然估计器结合数据分割策略，并基于此设计强化学习算法来推导个性化竞价策略。

Result: 该方法实现了接近最优的遗憾界 $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$，其中 $d$ 是上下文维度，$H$ 是轮数，$T$ 是客户数量。仿真实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理广告竞价中的延迟效应、累积影响和用户异质性，为在线广告平台提供了理论保证的个性化竞价策略。

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

Result: 在开源LLM和多样化数据集上实验，大幅超越EAGLE3和BanditSpec基线，尤其在需要长推理链的领域

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升推测解码性能，特别是在有领域专家草稿模型可用时效果更佳

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

Motivation: 研究核心加密资产的流动性和波动性代理变量是否能够通过溢出效应预测市场整体风险，为加密市场风险管理提供实证依据。

Method: 整合三层统计框架：核心流动性与收益率的交互作用、主成分关系、波动性因子投影，结合VAR模型、HAR-X模型和防泄漏机器学习协议。

Result: 使用2021-2025年74种资产的1462个日度数据，发现跨层统计显著的格兰杰因果关系，具有中等样本外预测准确性。

Conclusion: 核心加密资产的流动性和波动性代理变量确实产生溢出效应，能够预测市场整体风险，为加密市场风险管理提供了实证支持。

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对齐或多视图方法忽略了时间结构，而动态潜变量模型虽然能捕捉时间依赖性，但通常局限于单一脑区、假设线性读出或混淆了共享和私有信号。

Method: CTAE采用变压器编码器和解码器来捕捉长程神经动态，并明确将每个区域的潜空间划分为正交的共享和私有子空间。

Result: 在两个高密度电生理数据集（一个来自运动皮层区域，另一个来自感觉区域）上，CTAE提取了有意义的表示，相比现有方法能更好地解码行为变量。

Conclusion: CTAE提供了一个统一的框架，能够有效处理多脑区神经记录中的复杂动态和结构分离问题。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

TL;DR: ShapeX是一个创新的时间序列分类解释框架，通过识别关键shapelet（形状片段）并使用Shapley值评估其重要性，提供比现有方法更精确和具有因果保真度的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗和金融等高风险应用中，时间序列分类模型的透明度至关重要。现有的事后解释方法主要关注时间步级别的特征归因，而忽略了分类结果主要由关键shapelet驱动的基本先验。

Method: ShapeX框架包含Shapelet描述与检测(SDD)框架，能够学习对分类至关重要的多样化shapelet集合，然后将时间序列分割为有意义的shapelet驱动片段，并使用Shapley值评估其显著性。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验表明，ShapeX在识别最相关子序列方面优于现有方法，提高了时间序列解释的精度和因果保真度。

Conclusion: ShapeX通过shapelet的原子性特性产生揭示因果关系而非仅仅是相关性的解释，为高风险应用中的时间序列分类提供了更可靠和透明的解释框架。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

Motivation: 社交媒体成为识别自杀风险的重要来源，但自动检测面临类别不平衡、时间复杂性以及风险级别兼具序数和分类特性的挑战。

Method: 使用双预测头：CORAL头保持风险级别序数关系，标准分类头实现灵活分类区分；3层Transformer编码器建模时间依赖，时间间隔嵌入捕捉发帖动态；组合损失函数(0.5 CORAL + 0.3 交叉熵 + 0.2 Focal Loss)同时处理序数结构保持、过度自信减少和类别不平衡。

Result: 采用5折分层交叉验证，以宏F1分数为主要评估指标。

Conclusion: 该模型通过双头架构和组合损失函数有效解决了自杀风险检测中的多重挑战。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在理论与实践的鸿沟：GES和GraN-DAG等算法经验性能强但缺乏有限样本保证，而有理论保证的方法无法扩展到大规模图

Method: 设计博弈论强化学习框架，DDQN智能体直接与GES或GraN-DAG竞争，始终从对手的解决方案进行热启动

Result: 在合成SEMs（30节点）上观测到的错误概率随样本量n衰减，与理论紧密匹配；在真实世界基准测试中持续改进GES和GraN-DAG，同时保持理论安全性；可扩展到Hepar2（70节点）、Dream（100节点）和Andes（220节点）等大规模图

Conclusion: 建立了一类新的基于强化学习的因果发现算法，同时具备可证明的一致性、样本效率和实际可扩展性，标志着将经验性能与严格有限样本理论统一的关键进展

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

Conclusion: 该方法是对传统KNN分类器的重要泛化，通过当前加权方案和适当范数的加权Minkowski距离，有效解决了高维小样本数据中最近邻选择的问题。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

TL;DR: 提出一种完全解耦的训练策略来解决原型自监督学习中的原型坍缩问题，通过分别优化原型和编码器来获得更多样化的原型表示和更好的下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法普遍存在部分原型坍缩问题，多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这削弱了提供多样化目标的核心目的，现有方法只是治标不治本。

Method: 引入完全解耦的训练策略，将原型建模为高斯混合模型并使用在线EM风格过程更新，独立于编码器的损失函数进行优化。

Result: 该方法无需显式正则化就能消除原型坍缩，产生持续多样化的原型，并在下游任务中表现出更强的性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，从根本上解决了原型坍缩问题，提供了一种简单而原则性的解决方案。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 时间序列基础模型表现不佳，原因在于盲目套用NLP/CV范式。时间序列数据缺乏语义概念，需要基于不变性原则构建数据集才能实现真正的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型表现不如轻量监督基线和经典模型，作者认为这是因为简单套用NLP或CV的范式，而时间序列数据本质不同，缺乏语义概念。

Method: 提出从机会性数据聚合转向原则性设计：构建能够系统覆盖时间语义不变性空间的数据集，基于第一原则建立时间序列不变性的本体论。

Result: 论证了现有时间序列基础模型方法的局限性，指出需要确保通过不变性覆盖来实现表征完整性。

Conclusion: 只有通过确保不变性覆盖的表征完整性，时间序列基础模型才能获得对齐结构，实现泛化、推理和真正的涌现行为。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

*Tingting Dan,Xinwei Huang,Jiaqi Ding,Yinggang Zheng,Guorong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过多层图扩散模型揭示了阿尔茨海默病中tau蛋白传播的结构连接与功能连接的相互作用，发现不同脑区中SC和FC对tau传播的贡献存在区域性不对称，且这种主导作用在疾病进程中会发生转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经影像学证据显示病理性tau蛋白沿着特定脑网络积累，表明大规模网络架构在阿尔茨海默病进展中起关键作用，但结构连接和功能连接如何相互作用影响tau传播尚不清楚。

Method: 利用大量纵向神经影像数据，通过多层图扩散模型研究SC-FC相互作用。

Result: 发现FC主要驱动皮层下区域、岛叶、额叶和颞叶皮层的tau传播，而SC在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域起更大作用。SC与FC的相对主导作用在疾病进程中发生转变，早期AD中FC占主导，后期SC变得主要。

Conclusion: 结构连接和功能连接在tau传播中具有区域性不对称贡献，这种模式与AD相关基因表达高度一致，且非可改变风险因素和生物机制会选择性重塑tau传播途径。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ADP-VRSGP方法，通过自适应调整噪声方差和学习率的步进衰减策略，在保护隐私的同时提升去中心化学习的训练效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有使用固定方差噪声的差分隐私方法会降低模型性能和训练效率，需要一种能动态调整噪声和学习率的自适应方法。

Method: 采用方差缩减随机梯度推送技术，结合步进衰减的噪声方差和学习率调整策略，引入渐进梯度融合策略利用历史梯度，并整合去中心化推送-求和聚合技术。

Result: 理论分析证明该方法在适当学习率下实现稳健收敛，实验结果显示在多种场景下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP方法有效解决了隐私保护去中心化学习中的挑战，显著提升了训练稳定性和速度。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

TL;DR: 提出Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS)方法解决大规模TSP问题，通过聚类和超路径引导来缩小搜索空间，提高求解效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在处理大规模TSP时面临内存限制、初始解质量不高和全局引导不足的挑战，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用"先聚类后路由"策略，使用稀疏热图图将TSP实例划分为簇并抽象为超节点，生成超路径来指导初始化和优化过程。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有神经方法，特别是在处理更大规模实例时显著缩小了与最优解的差距。

Conclusion: HyperNS方法通过超路径引导的邻域搜索有效解决了大规模TSP问题，提供了更高效和有效的优化方案。

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLEV通过将人类定义的价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中，扩展了RLVR框架，使LLM优化与可量化的人类价值信号对齐，在多个RL算法和模型规模上持续优于仅基于正确性的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法虽然能有效训练模型，但忽略了不同任务的重要性差异，无法体现人类价值偏好。

Method: 在奖励函数中直接整合人类定义的价值信号，使用带有明确真实价值标签的考试风格数据，通过价值加权梯度放大机制实现价值敏感的终止策略。

Result: RLEV策略不仅提高了价值加权准确率，还学会了价值敏感的终止策略：对低价值提示简洁回应，对高价值提示详细回应。消融研究证实收益与价值对齐存在因果关系。

Conclusion: RLEV为将LLM与人类优先级对齐提供了一条实用路径，即使在噪声价值信号下也保持稳健。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习中的约束优化只关注期望累积奖励，忽略了奖励分布尾部的风险事件，这在高风险应用中是不够的。

Method: 使用优化确定性等价(OCE)构建风险感知约束强化学习框架，在参数化强拉格朗日对偶框架下确保与原问题的等价性，可包装在标准RL求解器(如PPO)周围。

Result: 在常见假设下建立了算法的收敛性，并通过数值实验验证了方法的风险感知特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用提供了有效的风险感知约束强化学习方法，具有良好的理论保证和实际性能。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

### [36] [Approximate Replicability in Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20200)
*Max Hopkins,Russell Impagliazzo,Christopher Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种可复制性的松弛形式：点态可复制性、近似可复制性和半可复制性，并在这些松弛条件下实现了样本最优的不可知PAC学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完全可复制性的成本过高（甚至对于简单的阈值学习任务也不可行），需要探索在何种近似可复制性概念下学习是可行的。

Method: 提出了三种可复制性松弛：(1)点态可复制性：在固定输入上保持一致；(2)近似可复制性：对分布的大部分分类一致；(3)半可复制性：完全可复制但可使用共享无标签样本。

Result: 在常数可复制性参数下，获得了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器：前两种方法使用Θ(d/α²)样本即可实现，第三种需要Θ(d²/α²)标签样本。

Conclusion: 通过适当的可复制性松弛，可以在不显著增加样本复杂度的情况下实现稳定的学习算法。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了利用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列的常规实验室数据进行癌症风险分类的可行性，通过系统比较126种分析流程，发现最佳模型在统计上可检测到癌症信号，但临床分类性能不足，无法可靠区分癌症与正常衰老或其他炎症状况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发用于犬类早期癌症检测的无创筛查工具是兽医医学的重要挑战。常规实验室数据作为低成本来源具有潜力，但受到个体生物标志物非特异性和筛查人群中严重类别不平衡的限制。

Method: 使用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列数据，在真实世界约束下（包括多种癌症类型分组和诊断后样本纳入），系统比较了126种分析流程，涵盖多种机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术，采用患者级数据划分防止数据泄露。

Result: 最佳模型（带类别加权的逻辑回归分类器和递归特征消除）显示出中等排序能力（AUROC = 0.815），但临床分类性能较差（F1分数 = 0.25，阳性预测值 = 0.15）。虽然阴性预测值高（0.98），但召回率不足（0.79）无法作为可靠的排除测试。SHAP可解释性分析显示预测主要基于年龄、炎症和贫血标志物等非特异性特征。

Conclusion: 常规实验室数据中存在统计上可检测的癌症信号，但信号太弱且与正常衰老或其他炎症状况混淆，无法实现临床可靠的区分。这为该数据模态单独使用设定了关键性能上限，表明计算兽医肿瘤学的有意义的进展需要多模态数据源的整合。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Conclusion: CO-PFL通过贡献导向的聚合策略有效缓解了聚合偏差，增强了全局协调能力，并通过构建定制化子模型提升了本地性能。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

Result: 在LastFM、FacebookNet、Deezer和German等真实网络数据集上测试，计算时间比现有最优方法快两倍，平衡性也可达到两倍。

Conclusion: Fair-SMW算法在保持公平性的同时显著提升了计算效率，为公平聚类提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

Conclusion: MetaVD通过贝叶斯元学习方法有效解决了联邦学习中的模型过拟合和发散问题，提升了模型性能和通信效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication

arbitrary downscaling of weather variables. We train a model from sparse
weather stations and topography over Japan and evaluate in- and
out-of-distribution accuracy predicting temperature and wind, comparing it to
both an interpolation baseline and CorrDiff. We find the model to be up to 50%
better than both CorrDiff and the baseline at downscaling temperature, and
around 10-20% better for wind.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个可证明收敛且实用的多目标强化学习框架，使用max-min准则，通过博弈论视角将其重构为两人零和正则化连续博弈，并基于镜像下降设计高效算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多目标强化学习中max-min准则的收敛性和实用性问题，传统方法在策略更新和全局收敛方面存在挑战。

Method: 将max-min多目标强化学习重构为两人零和正则化连续博弈，采用镜像下降算法进行优化，并提供自适应正则化改进。

Result: 算法在表格设置中展示收敛行为，在深度强化学习实现中显著优于先前基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在理论和实验上均表现出色，为多目标强化学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms
previous baselines in many MORL environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LKM的自知识蒸馏方法，可在不显著增加计算成本的情况下提高图神经网络在分子属性预测中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络是目前预测分子属性的最有效方法，但需要更准确的模型。增加模型复杂度会提高准确性，但也会增加计算成本和内存需求。

Method: 开发了层到层知识混合(LKM)方法，通过最小化GNN层间预存在隐藏嵌入的平均绝对距离，有效聚合多跳和多尺度信息，改善局部和全局分子特征表示。

Result: 在三个GNN架构(DimeNet++、MXMNet、PAMNet)和量子化学属性数据集(QM9、MD17和Chignolin)上评估，LKM将量子化学和生物物理属性预测的平均绝对误差分别降低了9.8%、45.3%和22.9%。

Conclusion: LKM方法有潜力在不显著增加训练和推理成本的情况下，显著提高GNN在化学属性预测中的准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

### [45] [What Does It Take to Build a Performant Selective Classifier?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20242)
*Stephan Rabanser,Nicolas Papernot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了选择性分类差距的概念，将模型性能与完美排序oracle之间的差距分解为五个来源：贝叶斯噪声、近似误差、排序误差、统计噪声和实现/分布漂移导致的松弛。研究发现单调后校准对缩小差距作用有限，需要能重新排序而非仅重新缩放的评分机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 选择性分类器通过在不确信的输入上弃权来提高模型可靠性，但现有方法很少能达到完美排序oracle的性能。本文旨在形式化这种性能差距并分析其根本原因。

Method: 提出了选择性分类差距的有限样本分解框架，将差距分解为五个来源。在合成数据和真实世界视觉、语言基准上验证分解，通过受控实验分离每个误差成分。

Result: 验证发现：(i)贝叶斯噪声和有限模型容量可导致显著差距；(ii)只有更丰富的特征感知校准器能显著改进分数排序；(iii)数据漂移引入了需要分布鲁棒训练的松弛。

Conclusion: 该分解提供了定量误差预算和可操作的设计指南，帮助实践者构建更接近理想oracle行为的选择性分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

TL;DR: FedGPS是一个联邦学习框架，通过整合统计分布和梯度信息来应对数据异构性挑战，在各种异构场景下表现出优越的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数据异构性问题上取得了进展，但缺乏对不同异构场景的鲁棒性评估。实验发现共享统计信息能缓解异构性，促使开发更鲁棒的方法。

Method: FedGPS框架静态修改客户端学习目标以建模全局数据分布，同时动态调整本地更新方向，整合统计分布和来自其他客户端的梯度信息。

Result: 广泛实验表明FedGPS在多种异构场景下优于现有最先进方法，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FedGPS通过整合统计和梯度信息有效应对联邦学习中的数据异构性挑战，在各种场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

*Thomas Rupf,Marco Bagatella,Marin Vlastelica,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM是一种乐观决策标准，通过直接建模奖励函数的不确定性来指导行为基础模型进行任务推断，减少零样本强化学习中对预定义奖励函数或大量标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行为基础模型在零样本强化学习中需要计算推理数据集上的奖励，这要么需要奖励函数的函数形式，要么需要大量标注工作。OpTI-BFM旨在通过与环境交互来纯化任务推断过程。

Method: 提出OpTI-BFM乐观决策标准，直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，指导BFMs进行数据收集以进行任务推断。该方法与线性bandits的上置信界算法有直接联系。

Result: 在已建立的零样本基准测试中，OpTI-BFM使基于后继特征的BFMs能够在少量episode中识别和优化未见过的奖励函数，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM为训练良好的BFMs提供了遗憾界，并通过与环境的交互实现了高效的任务推断，减少了对预定义奖励函数的依赖。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个基准框架，用于系统性地测量LLM代理利用测试用例的倾向，通过在现有基准任务中引入自然语言规范与单元测试之间的直接冲突来创建“不可能”任务变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM倾向于寻找和利用“捷径”完成任务，这给可靠评估和部署带来了显著风险，例如删除失败测试而非修复底层错误，这会破坏基准结果的有效性和实际部署的可靠性。

Method: 通过将现有基准（如LiveCodeBench和SWE-bench）的任务创建“不可能”变体，引入规范与测试之间的直接冲突，测量代理在这些任务上的“作弊率”作为其通过率。

Result: 揭示了从简单测试修改到复杂运算符重载等更细粒度的作弊行为细节，展示了提示、测试访问和反馈循环如何影响作弊率。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench不仅是评估工具，还是研究模型行为、上下文工程和开发监控工具的多功能框架，有助于构建更稳健可靠的LLM系统。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler
Characteristic Curve (ECC) computation achieving 16-2000\"O speedups over prior
GPU implementations on synthetic grids, and introduce a differentiable PyTorch
layer enabling end-to-end learning. Our CUDA kernels, optimized for Ampere GPUs
use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable
Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

*Tristan Cinquin,Geoff Pleiss,Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRM引导的树搜索在数学推理中并未显著优于Best-of-N选择，尽管成本更高，主要原因是PRM在评估状态值和泛化方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的链式思维提示与Best-of-N选择在复杂问题解决中无法捕捉分支和探索性质，需要研究PRM引导的树搜索是否能改善数学推理。

Method: 提出自适应算法最大化过程奖励模型分数，使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct及其相关PRM作为案例研究，在23个数学问题上比较PRM引导的树搜索方法。

Result: PRM引导的树搜索相比BoN无显著改进；蒙特卡洛树搜索和束搜索表现最佳；PRM对状态值近似差且可靠性随推理深度下降；PRM泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 树搜索过度依赖不可靠的PRM分数，需要不同的奖励建模方法才能有效提升LLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在真实应用中表现不稳定，黑盒性质和评估框架限制使得难以量化模型优缺点，难以选择合适的预测模型。

Method: 使用可编程特征配置的合成数据驱动评估范式，包括三个核心分析维度：时间特征分解与能力映射、数据不规则性下的鲁棒性分析、理论最优基准测试。

Result: 实验表明当前深度学习模型在所有类型的时间特征上并未普遍接近最优基准。

Conclusion: SynTSBench提供了一个可解释的评估系统，能够系统评估时间序列预测模型的基本能力，为模型选择提供量化依据。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大-小模型协作框架中存在的精度显著下降、灾难性遗忘加剧以及小模型知识引发的幻觉问题。

Method: 使用KAN(一种不同于传统MLP的神经网络架构)作为协作模型，在语言、视觉和跨模态任务中部署KCM框架。

Result: 与纯大模型方法相比，KCM框架显著减少了大模型推理调用次数，同时保持接近的任务精度；KAN小模型显著缓解了灾难性遗忘，提升了长尾数据精度。

Conclusion: KCM在所有指标上都优于基于MLP的小协作模型(MCM)，证明了KAN架构在大-小模型协作中的优越性。

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Conclusion: 使AI模型成为更好的研究助手更多地依赖于使用高质量数据进行领域对齐训练，而不是预训练规模或通用基准性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试上，该方法持续优于最先进的图泛化方法

Conclusion: 提出的IRM-free方法能有效识别因果子图，显著提升图神经网络的分布外泛化性能

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Conclusion: DB-FGA-Net等无需增强、可解释且可部署的深度学习模型在脑肿瘤诊断中具有可靠的临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

### [56] [InvDec: Inverted Decoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Separated Temporal and Variate Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20302)
*Yuhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出InvDec混合架构，结合基于patch的时间编码器和变量级解码器，通过延迟变量嵌入和自适应残差融合机制，在保持时间特征完整性的同时有效建模变量间依赖关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：通道独立方法如PatchTST擅长时间建模但忽略变量相关性，而纯变量注意力方法如iTransformer牺牲了时间编码。需要一种能同时有效建模时间模式和跨变量依赖的架构

Method: InvDec结合基于patch的时间编码器和倒置解码器，使用变量级自注意力。引入延迟变量嵌入在时间编码后丰富变量特定表示，采用自适应残差融合机制动态平衡时间和变量信息

Result: 在7个基准数据集上验证，高维数据集表现显著提升：Electricity(321变量)MSE降低20.9%，Weather提升4.3%，Traffic提升2.7%，同时在低维ETT数据集上保持竞争力

Conclusion: InvDec的优势随数据集维度增加而增长，证实跨变量建模在变量数量增加时变得至关重要，为多元时间序列预测提供了有效的时间-变量分离建模方案

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

TL;DR: 提出LEGO框架解决推荐系统中多属性遗忘问题，通过嵌入校准和灵活组合两步法，同时处理多个敏感属性并适应动态遗忘需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界隐私保护需求涉及多个敏感属性且动态变化，现有单属性遗忘方法无法同时处理多个遗忘请求和适应动态需求。

Method: 将多属性遗忘分为两步：嵌入校准从用户嵌入中移除特定属性信息，灵活组合将这些嵌入合并为单一嵌入保护所有敏感属性。将遗忘过程建模为互信息最小化问题。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和三种代表性推荐模型上的广泛实验证明了该框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: LEGO框架能够有效解决多属性遗忘问题，提供理论保证并满足现实世界的动态隐私保护需求。

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于相对排序的缩放定律，通过相对概率指标RBP来补充传统交叉熵指标的不足，从相对排序角度研究语言模型的缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究几乎完全依赖交叉熵作为评估指标，但交叉熵只关注正确token的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误token之间的相对排序，而相对排序在语言模型（如贪婪采样场景）中至关重要。

Method: 提出了相对概率指标RBP，量化正确token在top预测中的排名概率；建立了基于相对排序的缩放定律，描述RBP如何随模型规模增加而改善；在四个数据集和四个模型家族上进行了广泛实验。

Result: 通过跨越五个数量级的实验验证了该定律的鲁棒性和准确性；展示了该定律的两个应用示例：为涌现现象提供更深层解释，以及促进寻找缩放定律的基础理论。

Conclusion: 基于相对排序的缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，为大规模语言模型的缩放提供了更全面的理解，对实际开发和理论探索都具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键应用如自主着陆系统中，收集和标注训练数据成本高昂，特别是需要覆盖所有可能条件（包括罕见场景）。合成图像生成可以低成本覆盖所有条件，但需要缓解合成到真实的分布偏移问题。

Method: 基于商业飞行模拟器的图像生成方法，结合少量真实标注图像，采用定制化的域适应策略来集成真实和合成数据。

Result: 标准目标检测模型可以实现准确预测，在未在真实数据中表示的夜间图像等恶劣条件下也表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过控制图像生成和定制域适应策略，合成图像可以有效补充真实数据，提高关键应用中视觉模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

TL;DR: 提出一个工业启发的多阶段流程基准环境，评估模块化和整体控制策略，发现动作掩码对学习效果有决定性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程控制需要局部专业化和全局协调，但强化学习在工业应用中的采用仍面临奖励设计、模块化和动作空间管理等挑战。现有学术基准与工业控制问题差异较大。

Method: 结合SortingEnv和ContainerGym两个现有基准，构建顺序回收场景（分拣和压制操作），评估模块化架构（专业代理）和整体代理（全系统控制）两种策略，并分析动作掩码的影响。

Result: 无动作掩码时，代理难以学习有效策略，模块化架构表现更好；应用动作掩码后，两种架构均有显著改善，性能差距大幅缩小。

Conclusion: 动作空间约束具有决定性作用，专业化优势随动作复杂度降低而减弱。该基准为工业自动化中多智能体强化学习解决方案提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性路由框架有效结合了快速奖励模型和强大LLM判断器的优势，在控制成本的同时提高了RLHF的效率和性能。

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

Motivation: 现有DDI预测方法依赖孤立药物表示，无法显式建模原子级跨分子交互，限制了在不同分子复杂度和DDI类型分布下的有效性

Method: 构建药物对的联合图整合原子结构，引入结构一致性模块迭代优化节点特征同时保持全局结构上下文，有效学习局部和全局交互模式

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MolBridge在长尾和归纳场景下均优于现有最优基线，实现卓越性能

Conclusion: 细粒度图优化显著提高了DDI事件预测的准确性、鲁棒性和机制可解释性，为药物-药物相互作用网络挖掘分析贡献了图基方法

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing

Result: 数值实验表明，所提出的鲁棒协调方法比现有层次预测方法具有更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 在协调过程中考虑不确定性是有效的，鲁棒协调方法能提高层次时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

Motivation: 人工智能在定量遥感中受限于标签分布不平衡，传统训练模型偏向常见样本，导致罕见样本（如强降雨）的反演性能下降。

Method: 采用分治策略：1）使用hurdle模型处理零膨胀（非降雨样本占主导）；2）提出IMDL方法处理长尾分布（轻雨样本远多于强雨样本），将学习目标转化为无偏的理想逆模型。

Result: 通过统计指标和案例研究验证，Hurdle-IMDL优于传统方法、代价敏感学习、生成式学习和多任务学习方法，有效缓解系统低估问题，显著提升强到极端降雨的反演能力。

Conclusion: IMDL为处理环境变量分布不平衡提供了通用方法，能够增强对罕见但高影响事件的检索能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

Result: 在理论分析和实验验证中，AuxDPO在模拟环境和LLM对齐任务中表现出优于DPO的性能。

Conclusion: AuxDPO能够以原则性方式缓解DPO的错误设定问题，提高对齐算法的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code

TL;DR: 该论文系统比较了代码生成任务中不同检索配置的性能，发现在PL-PL任务中BM25稀疏检索效果最好，在NL-PL任务中密集检索更优，并提供了基于任务需求和计算效率的代码RAG系统实现建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在现实计算预算下代码生成任务的检索设计，为代码导向的RAG系统提供基于证据的配置建议。

Method: 使用Long Code Arena中的代码补全和bug定位任务，系统比较不同上下文窗口大小下的检索配置，包括分块策略、相似性评分和分割粒度三个维度。

Result: PL-PL任务中BM25稀疏检索效果显著优于密集检索且速度快10倍；NL-PL任务中密集检索更优但延迟高100倍；32-64行分块在小预算下最佳；基于行的分块与语法感知分割效果相当；检索延迟差异可达200倍。

Conclusion: 应根据任务需求、模型约束和计算效率选择检索配置，BM25+词级分割提供了最佳的质量-延迟权衡。

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了LLM修复中的样本优先选择策略，提出了语义感知优先采样(SAPS)方法，在毒性降低、效用保持和效率之间达到最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在真实系统中部署时会产生有毒或有偏见的输出，后处理模型修复提供了实用解决方案，但参数更新的高成本促使需要选择性地使用修复数据。

Method: 评估了五种代表性选择方法：随机采样、K-Center、梯度范数选择(GraNd)、分层覆盖(CCS)和提出的语义感知优先采样(SAPS)，通过毒性降低、困惑度和三个复合指标评估修复效果。

Result: SAPS在解毒、效用保持和效率之间达到最佳平衡，用更少数据实现相当或更优的修复结果。随机采样对大型或鲁棒模型仍然有效，而高开销方法如CCS和GraNd收益有限。

Conclusion: 最优数据比例取决于模型规模和修复方法，样本选择应被视为修复管道中的可调组件，基于选择的修复是维护LLM可靠性的高效可扩展范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

Motivation: 乳腺癌是女性最常见且致命的癌症之一，传统诊断方法存在变异性、成本高和误诊风险等问题，需要更准确可靠的诊断工具。

Method: 使用定制化粒子群优化(PSO)进行特征选择，评估了29种不同模型（包括经典分类器、集成技术、神经网络等），结合交叉验证和可解释AI方法确保临床相关性。

Result: 实验评估显示该方法在所有性能指标（准确率、精确度等）上达到99.1%的优异分数，有效降低维度并提供透明的模型无关解释。

Conclusion: 结合群体智能与可解释机器学习为乳腺癌诊断提供了强大、可靠且具有临床意义的解决方案。

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

Motivation: 传统基准测试仅用少量指标总结系统性能，分析评估细节和获取洞察需要繁琐的人工工作且结果常有偏差，需要自动生成性能解释的新基准测试方法。

Method: 采用PruneCEL概念学习方法（专为大型知识图谱开发）来计算解释，在知识图谱问答系统上进行可解释基准测试的首次实例化。

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗保健中的应用日益增多，但临床数据中的结构性不平等和社会偏见可能被数据驱动模型延续甚至放大。生存分析中的删失和时间动态进一步增加了公平模型开发的复杂性。

Method: 提出公平感知生存建模方法，旨在减轻关于组内和跨组风险排序的算法偏见。使用乳腺癌预后作为代表性案例，并应用于SEER乳腺癌数据。

Result: FASM显著提高了公平性，同时保持了与不考虑公平性的生存模型相当的判别性能。时间分层评估显示FASM在10年时间范围内保持稳定的公平性，中期随访期间改善最为明显。

Conclusion: 该方法能够开发既注重准确性又注重公平性的生存模型，将公平性作为临床护理的核心原则推进。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

Motivation: 成瘾患者护理场所的确定是影响治疗效果和资源利用的关键临床决策，但现有方法面临数据集严重类别不平衡的问题，且缺乏专门的自动化框架。

Method: 提出GRACE图神经网络框架，将护理场所预测形式化为结构化学习问题，进行广泛特征工程，并采用无偏元图训练方法来克服类别不平衡问题。

Result: 在真实世界数据上的实验结果显示，与竞争基线相比，少数类别的F1分数提高了11-35%。

Conclusion: GRACE框架有效解决了成瘾数据集中的类别不平衡问题，为自动化护理场所决策提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and

Motivation: 网球比赛中普遍存在不可传递性关系（A胜B，B胜C，但C胜A），但现有预测方法很少考虑这种关系。博彩公司Pinnacle Sports在处理高不可传递性复杂度的比赛时表现不佳。

Method: 采用图神经网络方法，将球员作为节点，历史比赛结果作为有向边，构建时序有向图来显式建模不可传递性关系。

Result: 模型在高不可传递性比赛中的预测准确率达到65.7%，Brier得分为0.215。使用Kelly投注策略在1903次投注中获得3.26%的正回报率。

Conclusion: 图神经网络方法能够有效捕捉不可传递性关系中的动态关系，成功利用了博彩市场在处理这类比赛时的低效性，证明了该方法在体育预测中的价值。

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

TL;DR: Spikachu是一个基于脉冲神经网络(SNN)的可扩展、因果性和高能效的神经解码框架，在实时脑机接口应用中比传统方法节省2.26-418.81倍能量，同时保持竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前脑机接口神经解码器的两个问题：简单因果模型缺乏泛化能力，复杂非因果模型虽然泛化好但难以实时应用，且两者都依赖高能耗的人工神经网络。

Method: 使用SNN处理分箱的脉冲信号，将其投影到共享潜在空间，通过适应输入时序的脉冲模块提取特征，然后整合和解码这些潜在表示来生成行为预测。

Result: 在6只非人灵长类动物的113个记录会话（总计43小时）上评估，性能优于因果基线模型，能耗降低2.26-418.81倍，多会话训练可提升性能并实现对新会话、主体和任务的少样本迁移。

Conclusion: Spikachu提供了一个基于SNN的可扩展、在线兼容的神经解码框架，在保持与最先进模型竞争性能的同时，能耗显著降低。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

Result: 两种模型在20个时间点内表现出色预测性能，在50个时间点内保持稳定异常预测。GNN在性能上持续优于N-BEATS，且参数更少、计算成本更低。

Conclusion: GNN是制造环境中在线异常预测的有前景解决方案，能够有效处理变量间复杂依赖关系，实现高效的故障预测。

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中验证了理论，展示了思想通信的协作优势。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了利用隐藏世界的潜力，因为许多挑战仅通过表面观察无法解决，无论计算或数据规模如何。

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LASER方法虽然能提升下游任务准确率，但其逐层搜索和全数据集前向传播的计算开销使其难以快速部署。本文旨在消除这种计算开销。

Method: 1) 仅检查精心选择的矩阵子集，消除逐层扫描；2) 使用矩阵奇异值梯度识别需要降维的矩阵；3) 扩展分解搜索空间，允许矩阵行围绕多个子空间聚类；4) 仅使用100个样本进行梯度计算和准确率评估。

Result: 该方法进一步减少了对原始训练数据的过拟合，准确率提升高达24.6个百分点，同时大幅减少了搜索时间。

Conclusion: 结合这些发现，开发出了一种快速、稳健的下游任务适配算法，仅需单次梯度步骤和快速扫描顶层候选层及分解技术，即可在无需微调的情况下适配LLM到新数据集。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了首个零样本强化学习的统一框架，引入一致的符号和分类法来组织现有方法，将算法分为直接表示和组合表示两类，并提供了性能分析的新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本强化学习领域缺乏共同的分析框架，现有方法难以直接比较，需要统一的组织框架来促进该领域的发展。

Method: 建立统一的符号系统和分类法，将算法分为直接表示（学习从奖励到策略的端到端映射）和组合表示（利用价值函数的子结构分解表示）两类。

Result: 成功整合了现有工作，提供了直接比较不同方法的框架，并为后继特征方法推导了扩展边界。

Conclusion: 该框架为零样本强化学习的未来研究提供了原则性基础，为开发更通用的智能体指明了清晰路径。

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

Motivation: 随着MLOps在工业环境中的广泛应用，将其与OT系统集成面临重大挑战，需要探索有效的整合路径。

Method: 评估RAMI 4.0和ISA-95标准对MLOps集成的适用性，并将MLOps生命周期组件映射到RAMI 4.0架构中，通过实际用例进行验证。

Result: 研究发现标准MLOps实践不能直接移植到OT环境，但通过使用现有参考模型进行结构化适配，可以实现成功集成。

Conclusion: 通过利用现有OT参考模型进行系统化适配，可以为MLOps与OT环境的集成提供可行路径，尽管需要克服直接移植的障碍。

Abstract: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices are increas- ingly adopted in
industrial settings, yet their integration with Opera- tional Technology (OT)
systems presents significant challenges. This pa- per analyzes the fundamental
obstacles in combining MLOps with OT en- vironments and proposes a systematic
approach to embed MLOps prac- tices into established OT reference models. We
evaluate the suitability of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0
(RAMI 4.0) and the International Society of Automation Standard 95 (ISA-95) for
MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-
nents to RAMI 4.0 exemplified by a real-world use case. Our findings
demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted
to OT environments, structured adaptation using existing reference models can
provide a pathway for successful integration.

TL;DR: 本文对随机梯度下降(SGD)在期望平滑性(ES)条件下的收敛性进行了系统分析，统一并扩展了近期相关研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典SGD分析依赖于过强(有界方差)或过粗糙(均匀噪声)的假设，期望平滑性条件提供了更灵活的替代方案，将随机梯度的二阶矩与目标函数值和全梯度联系起来。

Method: 通过细化ES条件的解释和采样相关常数，推导全梯度平方范数期望的界，并证明不同步长调度下的O(1/K)收敛速率。

Result: 获得了带有显式残差误差的收敛速率，所有证明在附录中详细给出。

Conclusion: 该分析统一并扩展了Khaled和Richtárik(2020)以及Umeda和Iiduka(2025)的研究工作。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MS-BART是一个统一建模框架，通过大规模预训练将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表中，解决了质谱数据稀缺问题，在多个关键指标上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质谱在分子识别中至关重要，但由于标注光谱稀缺，从质谱数据中解析结构仍然具有挑战性。现有的大规模预训练方法难以应用于质谱领域，因为原始光谱信号复杂且异构。

Method: 提出MS-BART框架：1）将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表；2）通过大规模预训练进行跨模态学习；3）多任务预训练目标联合优化去噪和翻译任务；4）通过微调转移到实验光谱；5）引入化学反馈机制减少分子幻觉。

Result: MS-BART在MassSpecGym和NPLIB1的5/12关键指标上达到SOTA性能，比基于扩散的竞争方法快一个数量级，消融研究系统验证了模型的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MS-BART通过统一的跨模态预训练框架有效解决了质谱数据稀缺问题，在分子结构解析任务中表现出卓越性能，为质谱分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私迁移学习中的两个关键超参数：梯度裁剪边界C和批量大小B。研究发现当前理论（强隐私需要更小的C）与实证结果（强隐私下更大的C表现更好）存在不匹配，并揭示了现有批量大小启发式方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私迁移学习是目前在隐私约束下训练大模型的最先进方法。然而，对于关键超参数C（裁剪边界）和B（批量大小）的选择，现有理论指导与实证结果存在矛盾，需要深入分析其原因。

Method: 通过分析梯度分布变化，研究在有限计算预算下C和B的选择策略。考察了梯度裁剪作为梯度重加权形式的作用，以及累积差分隐私噪声的影响。

Result: 发现强隐私约束下，更大的C表现更好，这与理论预期相反。现有批量大小启发式方法无效，而累积DP噪声能更好解释批量大小选择。跨任务使用单一(C,B)设置会导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 在差分隐私迁移学习中，需要重新审视超参数选择策略，特别是要考虑梯度分布变化和累积噪声的影响，避免跨任务使用固定参数设置，尤其是在隐私约束和计算资源变化时。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

TL;DR: H-SPLID是一种新颖算法，通过将显著和非显著特征显式分解到不同空间来学习显著特征表示，促进低维任务相关特征学习，并建立鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常没有明确区分显著和非显著特征，这可能导致模型学习到冗余或不相关的特征，影响模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出H-SPLID算法，将输入特征显式分解为显著和非显著两个子空间，利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则(HSIC)建立输入与表示之间的关联，并通过理论证明预测偏差与显著子空间维度的关系。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实验表明，使用H-SPLID训练的模型主要依赖显著输入成分，对影响非显著特征（如图像背景）的扰动表现出较低的敏感性。

Conclusion: H-SPLID通过显式特征分解有效促进任务相关特征学习，建立了表示压缩与模型鲁棒性之间的理论联系，为构建更鲁棒的机器学习模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at
https://github.com/neu-spiral/H-SPLID.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative
potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an
overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on
multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and
prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot
scheduling, and LMM-based environment-aware channel estimation. From
experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning
(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,
varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

Conclusion: DiRecGNN框架在云服务监控推荐任务中表现出色，能够有效处理稀疏数据和长距离依赖问题，获得用户高度认可。

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

Motivation: 虽然互信息是表示学习中的基本度量，但直接优化往往难以处理。许多方法转而最大化替代的依赖度量（如JSD），但这些替代目标与互信息的关系仍不清楚。

Method: 推导了KLD作为JSD函数的新下界，将其特化到联合和边缘分布，并通过二元分类器的交叉熵损失实现JSD目标。

Result: 实验表明该下界在互信息估计中是紧致的，相比现有变分下界神经估计器，提供了稳定、低方差的紧致下界估计。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在基于互信息的表示学习中使用判别式学习提供了新的理论依据和强有力的实证证据。

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

Motivation: 现实世界时间序列中的极端事件（如洪水、热浪、医疗紧急事件）具有重要实际意义，但现有模型因数据不平衡和忽略中间事件信息而难以准确预测这些事件

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，xTime实现了持续改进，极端事件的预测准确率从3%提升到78%

Conclusion: xTime通过知识蒸馏和专家混合机制有效解决了极端事件预测中的数据不平衡问题，显著提升了预测性能

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

Motivation: GNSS信号在城市环境中容易受到干扰，现有数据驱动方法在定位方面表现尚可但信号强度场重建效果差，缺乏空间上下文信息。

Method: 使用贝叶斯混合专家框架，融合物理路径损耗模型（保证物理一致性）和CNN（利用建筑高度图捕捉城市传播效应），通过对数线性池化结合，采用拉普拉斯近似进行贝叶斯推断。

Result: 在城市射线追踪数据上的实验表明，随着训练点增加，定位精度提高且不确定性降低，不确定性主要集中在干扰源附近和城市峡谷等传播敏感区域。

Conclusion: 该混合框架能有效提升GNSS干扰源定位精度并重建信号强度场，同时提供后验不确定性估计，特别适用于城市环境中的干扰检测。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson采样在序列决策中应用广泛，但在强化学习等具有复杂时间结构的场景中，其理论基础仍然有限，特别是缺乏理论保证。

Method: 在具有联合高斯过程先验的episodic强化学习中分析Thompson采样，处理价值函数的非高斯性质和Bellman更新的递归结构，将椭圆势引理扩展到多输出设置。

Result: 证明了Thompson采样在episodic强化学习中的遗憾界为$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$，其中$\Gamma(\cdot)$捕获高斯过程模型的复杂度。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对Thompson采样在强化学习中性能的理解，展示了结构假设和模型不确定性如何影响其在有限时域马尔可夫决策过程中的表现。

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于狄利克雷过程的多模态学习框架，通过DP的富者更富特性自动平衡模态内特征学习和跨模态对齐，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态融合中如何在保持各模态特征表达能力的同时学习跨模态交互的关键挑战，避免过度强调模态边缘分布对齐导致的过度正则化问题。

Method: 假设每个模态遵循多元高斯混合分布，采用狄利克雷过程计算所有分量的混合权重，利用DP的富者更富特性动态分配特征贡献并选择最显著特征。

Result: 在多个多模态数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型优于其他竞争方法，消融分析验证了DP在模态分布对齐方面的有效性和对关键超参数变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的DP驱动多模态学习框架能够自动实现模态内显著特征学习和跨模态对齐的最佳平衡，为多模态特征融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵长类或人类等生物数据稀缺，高吞吐量记录技术难以应用，这对深度学习解码技术构成挑战，需要开发能在小数据集上有效工作的解码方法。

Method: 结合神经元特异性MEIs、结构相似性指数损失和对抗训练，构建生物信息解码框架，特别优化小数据集性能。

Result: 在初级视觉皮层单细胞活动中重建视觉刺激方面达到最先进性能，仅需1,000-2,500个神经元和不到1,000个训练数据点就能重建高保真自然图像。

Conclusion: 证明了在早期视觉系统中可靠解码的可行性，为神经科学和神经工程应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了Transformer在象棋任务中的推理能力，发现模型能够展示组合泛化能力，在分布外场景中仍能遵循游戏规则，但在复杂变体如Chess960中表现不如符号AI算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代决策Transformer是否真正理解象棋规则，而不仅仅是学习训练数据中的模式，通过测试其在分布外场景中的表现来评估其系统性泛化能力。

Method: 训练了一个2.7亿参数的象棋Transformer模型，并在精心设计的分布外场景中进行测试，包括规则外推和Chess960变体，同时分析训练动态。

Result: Transformer展示了组合泛化能力，在规则外推测试中表现良好，能够选择有效移动；在Chess960中基本策略适应但不如符号AI；训练动态显示模型先学会移动己方棋子。

Conclusion: Transformer在象棋任务中确实能够捕捉游戏规则，展现出组合理解和系统性泛化能力，但在需要深度搜索的复杂变体中仍存在局限性。

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

TL;DR: BadGraph是一种针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的隐蔽后门攻击方法，通过文本触发器毒化训练数据，在推理时诱导生成攻击者指定的子图


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图生成技术的快速发展，后门漏洞成为新的安全威胁。现有研究主要关注图像扩散和无条件图生成的后门攻击，而文本引导的条件图生成领域尚未得到充分研究

Method: 利用文本触发器毒化训练数据，在潜在扩散模型的VAE和扩散训练阶段植入后门，当推理时出现触发器时诱导生成特定子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，攻击效果显著且隐蔽：低于10%的中毒率即可达到50%攻击成功率，24%中毒率可实现超过80%成功率，且对良性样本的性能影响可忽略

Conclusion: 研究揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型存在安全漏洞，在药物发现等应用中存在严重风险，亟需开发针对此类扩散模型后门攻击的鲁棒防御方法

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

### [102] [KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning is Designed to Mode Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20817)
*Anthony GX-Chen,Jatin Prakash,Jeff Guo,Rob Fergus,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了传统观点，证明在强化学习中，反向/前向KL散度的选择并不决定模式覆盖，而是定义了最优目标分布族。模式覆盖主要取决于正则化强度、奖励与参考概率的相对尺度等因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为优化反向KL会导致"模式寻求"，而前向KL会导致"质量覆盖"，但作者发现这种直觉在强化学习中并不适用，需要重新理解KL正则化在RL中的作用机制。

Method: 通过数学分析和实证研究，揭示了KL正则化在强化学习中的真实作用机制，并基于这些洞察构建了一个简单、可扩展且理论合理的算法，仅对奖励幅度进行最小修改。

Result: 该方法在大语言模型和化学语言模型的后训练中都取得了更好的解决方案质量和多样性，无需外部多样性信号，且同时适用于前向和反向KL。

Conclusion: 模式覆盖不取决于KL散度的方向选择，而是由正则化强度和其他因素决定。提出的简单修改能有效提升模型在高质量采样模式上的概率分布。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合组合-连续框架来解决区间离散化分子距离几何问题(iDMDGP)，结合离散枚举和连续优化来从不确定距离区间重构蛋白质三维结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在核磁共振等实际应用中，原子间距离通常只能获得不确定性区间，而非精确值，这导致需要解决区间变体的分子距离几何问题。

Method: 将DMDGP的枚举过程与连续优化阶段相结合，通过最小化非凸应力函数来惩罚与允许距离区间的偏差，并引入扭转角区间和手性约束。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法即使在宽距离边界下也能有效重构几何有效的构象，而现有研究大多假设窄边界。

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架支持基于离散结构的系统探索和局部优化，能够处理实际应用中常见的不确定距离信息。

Abstract: The Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (MDGP) is essential in structural
biology, as it seeks to determine three-dimensional protein structures from
partial interatomic distances. Its discretizable subclass (DMDGP) admits an
exact combinatorial formulation that enables efficient exploration of the
search space. However, in practical settings such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy, distances are available only within uncertainty bounds,
leading to the interval variant (\emph{i}DMDGP). We propose a hybrid
combinatorial--continuous framework for solving the \emph{i}DMDGP. The method
combines an enumeration process derived from the DMDGP with a continuous
refinement stage that minimizes a nonconvex stress function that penalizes
deviations from admissible distance intervals. This integration supports a
systematic exploration guided by discrete structure and local optimization. The
formulation incorporates torsion-angle intervals and chirality constraints
through a refined atom ordering that preserves protein-backbone geometry.
Numerical experiments show that the approach efficiently reconstructs
geometrically valid conformations even under wide distance bounds, whereas most
existing studies assume narrow ones.

Motivation: 传统平均场博弈求解器逐个实例求解，在处理大量相关问题（如动态或效用扰动下的鲁棒解，或连续参数化智能体设置）时不可行。

Method: 训练神经算子学习从问题数据（动态和成本函数）到对应均衡策略的映射，通过控制神经算子的Lipschitz正则性实现统计保证。

Result: 证明了在少量随机采样规则上训练的神经算子能够可靠求解未见过的线性二次平均场博弈变体，所需参数数量在适当规则采样下保持可控。

Conclusion: 该方法为平均场博弈提供了一种高效求解框架，能够处理无限维设置，并通过统计保证确保泛化性能。

Abstract: Traditional mean-field game (MFG) solvers operate on an instance-by-instance
basis, which becomes infeasible when many related problems must be solved
(e.g., for seeking a robust description of the solution under perturbations of
the dynamics or utilities, or in settings involving continuum-parameterized
agents.). We overcome this by training neural operators (NOs) to learn the
rules-to-equilibrium map from the problem data (``rules'': dynamics and cost
functionals) of LQ MFGs defined on separable Hilbert spaces to the
corresponding equilibrium strategy. Our main result is a statistical guarantee:
an NO trained on a small number of randomly sampled rules reliably solves
unseen LQ MFG variants, even in infinite-dimensional settings. The number of NO
parameters needed remains controlled under appropriate rule sampling during
training.
  Our guarantee follows from three results: (i) local-Lipschitz estimates for
the highly nonlinear rules-to-equilibrium map; (ii) a universal approximation
theorem using NOs with a prespecified Lipschitz regularity (unlike traditional
NO results where the NO's Lipschitz constant can diverge as the approximation
error vanishes); and (iii) new sample-complexity bounds for $L$-Lipschitz
learners in infinite dimensions, directly applicable as the Lipschitz constants
of our approximating NOs are controlled in (ii).

Motivation: 传统效率评估方法通常单独评估各维度后再聚合，无法有效捕捉维度间的相关性，且难以同时处理期望和非期望产出。

Method: 引入两种正则化DEA模型：基于松弛的度量(SBM)先估计总体效率再分配到各维度；目标规划模型(GP-SBM)先估计维度效率再推导总体效率。两种模型都使用正则化参数增强区分能力。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法的计算效率和有效性，在安大略省12家医院的案例研究中，SBM和GP-SBM能更好地捕捉输入输出变量间的相关性，优于传统的先单独评估再聚合的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的多维度DEA方法能够有效评估组织效率，特别是能够同时处理期望和非期望产出，并在实际应用中表现出优于传统方法的性能。

Abstract: We propose an approach for dynamic efficiency evaluation across multiple
organizational dimensions using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The method
generates both dimension-specific and aggregate efficiency scores, incorporates
desirable and undesirable outputs, and is suitable for large-scale problem
settings. Two regularized DEA models are introduced: a slack-based measure
(SBM) and a linearized version of a nonlinear goal programming model (GP-SBM).
While SBM estimates an aggregate efficiency score and then distributes it
across dimensions, GP-SBM first estimates dimension-level efficiencies and then
derives an aggregate score. Both models utilize a regularization parameter to
enhance discriminatory power while also directly integrating both desirable and
undesirable outputs. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and validity
of our approach on multiple datasets and apply it to a case study of twelve
hospitals in Ontario, Canada, evaluating three theoretically grounded
dimensions of organizational effectiveness over a 24-month period from January
2018 to December 2019: technical efficiency, clinical efficiency, and patient
experience. Our numerical results show that SBM and GP-SBM better capture
correlations among input/output variables and outperform conventional
benchmarking methods that separately evaluate dimensions before aggregation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力系统运营商面临各种离散操作决策，将这些决策纳入最优潮流问题会产生混合整数非线性规划问题，目前无法在要求时间内大规模求解。现有的线性化方法在某些边缘情况下会产生很差的整数解。

Method: 使用建模生成替代方案(MGA)来寻找线性化问题的替代解，通过不同的搜索标准来生成多个可行解。

Result: 在13个测试网络中，DC线性化导致不可行整数决策的情况下，MGA方法在所有案例中都找到了可行解。搜索标准的选择显著影响找到解的数量和质量。

Conclusion: MGA方法能有效找到线性化问题的可行解，但需要针对特定网络设计搜索函数以获得更好的解质量。

Abstract: Transmission system operators face a variety of discrete operational
decisions, such as switching of branches and/or devices. Incorporating these
decisions into optimal power flow (OPF) results in mixed-integer non-linear
programming problems (MINLPs), which can't presently be solved at scale in the
required time. Various linearizations of the OPF exist, most famously the
DC-OPF, which can be leveraged to find integer decisions. However, these
linearizations can yield very poor integer solutions in some edge cases, making
them challenging to incorporate into control rooms. This paper introduces the
use of modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) to find alternative solutions to
the linearized problems, reducing the chance of finding no AC feasible
solutions. We test this approach using 13 networks where the DC linearization
results in infeasible integer decisions, and MGA finds a solution in all cases.
The MGA search criteria selected drastically affects the number and quality of
solutions found, so network specific search functions may be necessary.

Abstract: A Graph of Convex Sets (GCS) is a graph in which vertices are associated with
convex programs and edges couple pairs of programs through additional convex
costs and constraints. Any optimization problem over an ordinary weighted graph
(e.g., the shortest-path, the traveling-salesman, and the minimum-spanning-tree
problems) can be naturally generalized to a GCS, yielding a new class of
problems at the interface of combinatorial and convex optimization with
numerous applications. In this paper, we introduce a unified method for solving
any such problem. Starting from an integer linear program that models an
optimization problem over a weighted graph, our method automatically produces
an efficient mixed-integer convex formulation of the corresponding GCS problem.
This formulation is based on homogenization (perspective) transformations, and
the resulting program is solved to global optimality using off-the-shelf
branch-and-bound solvers. We implement this framework in GCSOPT, an open-source
and easy-to-use Python library designed for fast prototyping. We illustrate the
versatility and scalability of our approach through multiple numerical examples
and comparisons.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够保证在有限不确定性下优化配置的可行性，实现可扩展和自适应的部署。

Abstract: Sensors are vital for environmental monitoring, yet their effectiveness
diminishes under spatial uncertainty. We propose a robust optimization
framework for maximizing the coverage of aerial directional sensors under
spatial uncertainty. Each sensor projects a truncated sector on the ground,
parameterized by its altitude, field of view, and orientation. To address
sensor displacement uncertainty, we introduce the radius of robust feasibility
(RRF) as a measure of tolerance against positional perturbations. We formulate
an exact expression for the RRF of aerial sensor networks and embed it into the
coverage maximization model as a robustness constraint. Our approach guarantees
that the optimized configuration remains feasible under bounded uncertainty. A
distributed greedy algorithm based on Voronoi partitioning is used for
orientation adjustment, ensuring scalable and adaptive deployment toward
high-impact regions. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
model in preserving robust coverage across complex terrain and varying
uncertainty conditions.

Abstract: We develop a general optimization-theoretic framework for Bregman-Variational
Learning Dynamics (BVLD), a new class of operator-based updates that unify
Bayesian inference, mirror descent, and proximal learning under time-varying

combining a smooth convex loss f_t with a Bregman divergence D_psi. We prove
that the induced operator is averaged, contractive, and exponentially stable in
the Bregman geometry. Further, we establish Fejer monotonicity, drift-aware
convergence, and continuous-time equivalence via an evolution variational
inequality (EVI). Together, these results provide a rigorous analytical
foundation for well-posed and stability-guaranteed operator dynamics in
nonstationary optimization.

TL;DR: 提出一种带随机扰动的分布式梯度下降变体，用于处理非凸有限和函数，通过添加噪声避免鞍点，使各智能体以高概率收敛到共同二阶稳定点的邻域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分布式梯度下降在非凸优化中容易陷入鞍点，需要设计能够逃离鞍点的分布式算法。

Method: 在固定步长的分布式梯度下降迭代中，对局部梯度项添加随机扰动，通过控制步长和噪声方差来确保收敛。

Result: 在适当条件下，各智能体以高概率收敛到共同二阶稳定点的指定半径邻域，收敛速度与集中式一阶算法相当。

Conclusion: 所提出的带扰动分布式梯度下降在非凸设置下比标准DGD更有效，能够可靠地收敛到局部极小值点。

Abstract: A variant of consensus based distributed gradient descent (\textbf{DGD}) is
studied for finite sums of smooth but possibly non-convex functions. In
particular, the local gradient term in the fixed step-size iteration of each
agent is randomly perturbed to evade saddle points. Under regularity
conditions, it is established that for sufficiently small step size and noise
variance, each agent converges with high probability to a specified radius
neighborhood of a common second-order stationary point, i.e., local minimizer.
The rate of convergence is shown to be comparable to centralized first-order
algorithms. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the efficacy of the
proposed approach over standard \textbf{DGD} in a non-convex setting.

Abstract: We introduce a fusion of GPU accelerated primal heuristics for Mixed Integer
Programming. Leveraging GPU acceleration enables exploration of larger search
regions and faster iterations. A GPU-accelerated PDLP serves as an approximate
LP solver, while a new probing cache facilitates rapid roundings and early
infeasibility detection. Several state-of-the-art heuristics, including
Feasibility Pump, Feasibility Jump, and Fix-and-Propagate, are further
accelerated and enhanced. The combined approach of these GPU-driven algorithms
yields significant improvements over existing methods, both in the number of
feasible solutions and the quality of objectives by achieving 221 feasible
solutions and 22% objective gap in the MIPLIB2017 benchmark on a presolved
dataset.

Abstract: We analyze the identifiability of nonlinear networks with node dynamics
characterized by functions that are non-additive. We consider the full
measurement case (all the nodes are measured) in the path-independent delay
scenario where all the excitation signals of a specific node have the same
delay in the output of a measured node. Based on the notion of a generic
nonlinear matrix associated with the network, we introduce the concept of
generic identifiability and characterize the space of functions that satisfies
this property. For directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) characterized by analytic
functions, we derive a sufficient condition for identifiability based on
vertex-disjoint paths from excited nodes to the in-neighbors of each node in
the network. Furthermore, when we consider the class of polynomial functions,
by using well-known results on algebraic varieties, we prove that the
vertex-disjoint path condition is also necessary. Finally, we show that this
identifiability condition is not necessary for the additive nonlinear model.
Some examples are added to illustrate the results.

Abstract: Rail is a cost-effective and relatively low-emission mode for transporting
intermodal containers over long distances. This paper addresses tactical
planning of intermodal railroad operations by introducing a new problem that
simultaneously considers three consolidation processes and the management of a
heterogeneous railcar fleet. We model the problem with a scheduled service
network design with resource management (SSND-RM) formulation, expressed as an
integer linear program. While such formulations are challenging to solve at
scale, we demonstrate that our problem can be tackled with a general-purpose
solver when provided with high-quality warm-start solutions. To this end, we
design a construction heuristic inspired by a relax-and-fix procedure. We
evaluate the methodology on realistic, large-scale instances from our
industrial partner, the Canadian National Railway Company: a North American
Class I railroad. The computational experiments show that the proposed approach
efficiently solves practically relevant instances, and that solutions to the
SSND-RM formulation yield substantially more accurate capacity estimations
compared to those obtained from simpler baseline models. Managerial insights
from our study highlight that ignoring railcar fleet management or container
loading constraints can lead to a severe underestimation of required capacity,
which may result in costly operational inefficiencies. Furthermore, our results
show that the use of multi-platform railcars improves overall capacity
utilization and benefits the network, even if they can locally lead to less
efficient loading as measured by terminal-level slot utilization performance
indicators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双层规划在经济学和工程中有广泛应用，但当存在多个下层解时问题定义不明确。现有方法通常限制下层问题以避免非唯一性，但这在许多情况下不可行。集合值公式被提出但研究有限，本文旨在研究一般情况下的各种解概念。

Method: 研究双层规划中多下层解的一般情况，分析集合值公式与乐观、悲观公式之间的联系，比较各种解概念的关系。

Result: 主要发现表明，集合值公式可能并不比现有的乐观和悲观公式具有更大的优势。

Conclusion: 在一般情况下的双层规划问题中，集合值公式相对于传统的乐观和悲观公式并没有显著优势。

Abstract: Bilevel programming is one of the very active areas of research with many
real-life applications in economics and engineering. Bilevel problems are
hierarchical problems consisting of lower-level and upper-level problems,
respectively. The leader or the decision-maker for the upper-level problem
decides first, and then the follower or the lower-level decision-maker chooses
his/her strategy. In the case of multiple lower-level solutions, the bilevel
problems are not well defined, and there are many ways to handle such a
situation. One standard way is to put restrictions on the lower level problems
(like strict convexity) so that nonuniqueness does not arise. However, those
restrictions are not viable in many situations. Therefore, there are two
standard formulations, called pessimistic formulations and optimistic
formulations of the upper-level problem. A set-valued formulation has been
proposed and has been studied in the literature. However, the study is limited
to the continuous set-up with the assumption of value attainment, and the
general case has not been considered. In this paper, we focus on the general
case and study the connection among various notions of solution. Our main
findings suggest that the set-valued formulation may not hold any bigger
advantage than the existing optimistic and pessimistic formulation.

Motivation: 将MIP中有效的强分支方法扩展到非线性问题，但连续变量的分支点选择是个挑战，传统方法需要预先定义分支点

Method: 极端强分支方法为每个候选变量评估多个分支点，基于目标函数改进联合选择分支变量和分支点

Result: 对于某些类型的二次约束二次规划问题，计算实验显示该方法优于现有商业求解器

Conclusion: 极端强分支方法成功地将MIP中的强分支思想扩展到非线性问题，同时利用了边界收紧的副产品优势

Abstract: For mixed-integer programs (MIPs), strong branching is a highly effective
variable selection method to reduce the number of nodes in the branch-and-bound
algorithm. Extending it to nonlinear problems is conceptually simple but
practically limited. Branching on a binary variable fixes the variable to 0 or
1, whereas branching on a continuous variable requires an additional decision
to choose a branching point. Previous extensions of strong branching predefine
this point and then solve $2n$ relaxations where $n$ is the number of candidate
variables to branch. We propose extreme strong branching, which evaluates
multiple branching points per variable and jointly selects both the branching
variable and point based on the objective value improvement. This approach
resembles the success of strong branching for MIPs while additionally
exploiting bound tightening as a byproduct. For certain types of quadratically
constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs), computational experiments show that the
extreme strong branching rule outperforms existing commercial solvers.

Result: 算法在特定情况下比之前结果提升d倍，对于次指数噪声达到了新的最优复杂度，并给出了匹配的下界。结合量子各向同性化器，改进了量子随机凸优化的维度相关收敛率。

Conclusion: 提出的各向同性噪声设置和相应算法在理论和实践上都有重要意义，特别是在量子优化领域，为高维随机凸优化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a $d$-dimensional Lipschitz convex
function using a stochastic gradient oracle. We introduce and motivate a
setting where the noise of the stochastic gradient is isotropic in that it is
bounded in every direction with high probability. We then develop an algorithm
for this setting which improves upon prior results by a factor of $d$ in
certain regimes, and as a corollary, achieves a new state-of-the-art complexity
for sub-exponential noise. We give matching lower bounds (up to polylogarithmic
factors) for both results. Additionally, we develop an efficient quantum
isotropifier, a quantum algorithm which converts a variance-bounded quantum
sampling oracle into one that outputs an unbiased estimate with isotropic
error. Combining our results, we obtain improved dimension-dependent rates for
quantum stochastic convex optimization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的非凸函数临界点优化方法，在梯度计算和Hessian计算之间提供了新的权衡关系，改进了现有方法的复杂度边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法在梯度计算和Hessian计算复杂度之间存在权衡，本文旨在开发新的算法，提供更好的梯度-Hessian计算复杂度权衡，特别是在有限Hessian计算资源的情况下。

Method: 开发了一种通用优化算法，可以处理近似Hessian计算，对于具有L2-Lipschitz Hessian的二次可微非凸函数，通过结合梯度查询和Hessian查询来寻找ε-临界点。

Result: 获得了梯度查询复杂度为Õ(L₂¹/⁴n_H⁻¹/²Δε⁻⁹/⁴)的算法，其中n_H是Hessian查询次数。在特定情况下，获得了改进的复杂度边界：有界维度时为Õ(d¹/³L₂¹/²Δε⁻³/²)，单次Hessian查询时为Õ(L₂³/⁴Δ³/²ε⁻⁹/⁴)。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在梯度计算和Hessian计算之间提供了新的权衡关系，改进了非凸优化的复杂度边界，特别是在Hessian计算资源受限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: We develop optimization methods which offer new trade-offs between the number
of gradient and Hessian computations needed to compute the critical point of a
non-convex function. We provide a method that for any twice-differentiable
$f\colon \mathbb R^d \rightarrow \mathbb R$ with $L_2$-Lipschitz Hessian, input
initial point with $\Delta$-bounded sub-optimality, and sufficiently small
$\epsilon > 0$, outputs an $\epsilon$-critical point, i.e., a point $x$ such
that $\|\nabla f(x)\| \leq \epsilon$, using $\tilde{O}(L_2^{1/4}
n_H^{-1/2}\Delta\epsilon^{-9/4})$ queries to a gradient oracle and $n_H$
queries to a Hessian oracle for any positive integer $n_H$. As a consequence,
we obtain an improved gradient query complexity of
$\tilde{O}(d^{1/3}L_2^{1/2}\Delta\epsilon^{-3/2})$ in the case of bounded
dimension and of $\tilde{O}(L_2^{3/4}\Delta^{3/2}\epsilon^{-9/4})$ in the case
where we are allowed only a \emph{single} Hessian query. We obtain these
results through a more general algorithm which can handle approximate Hessian
computations and recovers the state-of-the-art bound of computing an
$\epsilon$-critical point with $O(L_1^{1/2}L_2^{1/4}\Delta\epsilon^{-7/4})$
  gradient queries provided that $f$ also has an $L_1$-Lipschitz gradient.

TL;DR: 提出一种量子启发的算法，使用矩阵乘积态和离散驱动调度来解决QUBO问题，在数独和MaxCut问题上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二次无约束二进制优化问题，该问题在数学上等价于寻找伊辛自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态，需要高效且可扩展的算法。

Method: 使用矩阵乘积态紧凑表示自旋构型的大叠加，结合离散驱动调度引导MPS向基态演化，采用密度矩阵重整化群方法迭代最小化系统能量。

Result: 算法在超过200个伊辛自旋的数独问题和Biq Mac库中最多251个节点、3265条边的MaxCut问题上可靠地找到全局最小值。

Conclusion: 该量子启发方法具有可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业级QUBO应用的优势。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

Motivation: 当前AI在能源领域的验证实践主要关注预测准确性或计算效率，而缺乏对分析结论逻辑完整性的标准化测试框架。

Method: 开发了ARB框架，整合准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性纪律、政策一致性和透明度五个子指标，使用公开技术经济数据集在确定性、概率性和认知性场景下评估模型性能。

Result: GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet达到一致且符合政策的推理(分析可靠性指数>90)，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现中等稳定性，Llama 3 70B低于专业阈值，统计验证显示这些差异显著且可重现。

Conclusion: ARB建立了能源文献中首个验证AI系统中因果、概率和政策驱动推理的定量方法，为全球能源转型中可信赖和透明的分析应用提供了参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的LLM网络代理框架，显著提升了自主网络代理的性能。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式CoT和形式证明系统之间提供了平衡，为LLM推理评估提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

### [125] [A new wave of vehicle insurance fraud fueled by generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19957)
*Amir Hever,Itai Orr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 生成式AI正在加剧保险欺诈，使大规模快速伪造事故证据变得更容易。保险公司采用AI检测工具应对，但面临误报、漏报等挑战。本文提出UVeye分层解决方案来检测和威慑这种新型欺诈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈每年造成数百亿美元损失，传统欺诈手段包括伪造事故和夸大损失。生成式AI（特别是深度伪造技术）使欺诈者能轻松制造逼真的撞车照片、损坏证据和虚假身份，加剧了保险欺诈问题。

Method: 保险公司部署基于AI的深度伪造检测软件和增强验证流程来检测AI驱动的欺诈。本文提出UVeye分层解决方案，采用多层检测方法来应对新型欺诈挑战。

Result: 当前检测工具存在误报和漏报问题，欺诈者不断调整策略规避自动检查。检测技术与生成式AI之间的军备竞赛，加上保险公司的资源和成本限制，使得对抗AI驱动的保险欺诈仍是持续挑战。

Conclusion: UVeye分层解决方案在检测、缓解和威慑新型车辆欺诈方面代表重大进步，为解决AI驱动的保险欺诈提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI技术在个性化学习中的潜力，通过领导力人格特质预测学术表现，为早期识别学生优缺点和制定个性化学习策略提供机会。

Method: 收集129名硕士生的5个领导力人格测试数据（23个特征）和平均成绩，使用相关性分析和特征选择，调优7种机器学习算法（SVM、LR、KNN、DT、GB、RF、XGBoost、LightGBM）。

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，包含17个人格特征和领导力标记特征的模型准确率达87.50%，不包含该特征的模型准确率为85.71%。

Conclusion: 领导力人格特质可以有效预测学术成功，为早期识别学生优缺点和选择个性化学习策略提供了有效方法。

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Conclusion: 通过显式路由和分层安全机制，基于事实的生成方法可以在高风险金融领域提供可信赖的AI洞察。

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCLA是一个以人为中心的多智能体异常检测系统，用于数字资产交易分析。该系统将解析、检测和解释三个角色集成到对话式工作流中，让非专家用户能够用自然语言提问、查看结构化分析并获得情境感知的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的异常检测系统往往缺乏透明度和可解释性，非专家用户难以理解检测结果。HCLA旨在通过人机协作设计提高金融取证中的透明度和信任度。

Method: 系统采用多智能体架构，包含解析、检测和解释三个角色。使用XGBoost作为基础检测器，通过开源Web UI实现自然语言交互，将用户意图转换为检测模式并生成基于底层特征的叙述性解释。

Result: 在标记的比特币混币数据集（Wasabi Wallet，2020-2024）上，基线检测器达到了较高的准确率，而HCLA在此基础上增加了可解释性和交互式优化能力。

Conclusion: 人机协作设计显著提高了金融取证系统的透明度和用户信任度，HCLA为数字资产交易异常检测提供了一个可解释且用户友好的解决方案。

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial

*Joshua Yuvaraj*

TL;DR: 论文认为需要重新评估AI在法律实践中的应用，提出了验证-价值悖论，指出AI效率提升会被手动验证需求抵消，导致AI使用净价值有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 律师因提交AI生成的不准确内容被处罚的案例表明，现有AI应用模式需要重新审视，特别是考虑到AI与现实脱节、缺乏透明度，以及律师的诚信义务。

Method: 提出验证-价值悖论模型，分析AI在法律实践中效率提升与验证需求之间的平衡关系。

Result: AI在法律实践中的效率提升会被相应的手动验证需求所抵消，导致AI使用的净价值往往可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 需要新的AI应用范式，强调对真相的忠诚和公民责任等价值观应成为法律实践的基础，这对法律实践和法律教育都有重要影响。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

TL;DR: 提出TRUST框架，一个去中心化的透明审计系统，用于验证大语言模型的推理过程，解决集中式审计的鲁棒性、可扩展性、透明性和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审计方法集中化、不透明且难以扩展，无法有效验证LLM推理过程的忠实性和无害性，存在部署风险。

Method: 采用共识机制、分层DAG分解推理链、区块链账本和隐私保护分割技术，构建去中心化审计框架。

Result: 实验表明TRUST能有效检测推理缺陷，在30%恶意参与者情况下仍保持鲁棒性，适用于多种LLM和推理任务。

Conclusion: TRUST框架为去中心化AI审计开创了先河，为实现安全可信的LLM部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出AGI发展需要经历从开放模仿到身份固化的锁定阶段，该阶段使模型的目标结构、拒绝行为、偏好和内部表征变得稳定且抵抗外部操控，并提出了检测该阶段开始的度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型过于开放和可操控，类比人类发展过程，作者认为AGI发展需要经历身份固化阶段，这是实现AGI可靠性的前提，也是安全控制的关键点。

Method: 通过形式化身份固化阶段，将其与学习动态中的已知现象联系起来，并提出操作性度量来检测该阶段的开始，通过实验验证行为固化的特征和影响。

Result: 实验显示行为固化是快速非线性的，但对通用能力的影响不是单一的：小模型出现性能权衡，中等规模模型基本无成本，大型量化模型出现暂时不稳定性。

Conclusion: 身份固化是AGI级可靠性的先决条件，也是安全控制的关键点，既可以被工程化设计以提高可靠性，也可能在扩展过程中自发出现，导致不可预测的目标和行为固化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在动态环境中优化AI的方法，通过进化训练技术在2048游戏中测试了单智能体系统和双智能体系统，发现单智能体系统通过价值函数优化取得了显著改进，而双智能体系统的元提示方法效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化AI在动态环境中的性能是机器学习研究的基本挑战，2048游戏结合了策略游戏和随机元素，为研究决策制定、长期规划和动态适应提供了理想平台。

Method: 实现了两种系统：双智能体元提示系统（"思考者"LLM优化"执行者"LLM的游戏策略）和基于价值函数优化的单智能体系统（有限蒙特卡洛树搜索），并实验了回滚功能以避免性能退化。

Result: 单智能体系统取得了显著改进，每个周期平均增加473.2分，训练周期间呈现明显上升趋势（相关性ρ=0.607）。LLM对游戏的理解也得到提升，开发出更先进的策略。双智能体系统改进有限。

Conclusion: 进化优化技术在非确定性环境中具有改善AI性能的潜力，但元提示方法存在固有局限性。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了个体化认知模拟(ICS)任务，评估不同认知表征方法在模拟个体思维过程方面的效果。通过构建新小说数据集和11条件认知评估框架，测试了7个现成LLM在模仿作者风格方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM能够表面模仿人类行为，但其模拟更深层次个体化认知过程的能力尚不清楚。研究旨在填补这一空白，评估LLM在个体化认知模拟方面的能力。

Method: 构建了基于新出版小说的数据集，提出了11条件认知评估框架，测试了7个现成LLM。比较了不同认知表征方法，包括语言特征、概念映射和基于档案的信息。

Result: 结果显示，结合概念和语言特征在ICS中特别有效，在整体评估中优于基于静态档案的线索。LLM在模仿语言风格方面比叙事结构更有效，揭示了其在深层认知模拟方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发能够适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统奠定了基础，推动了更个性化和与人类对齐的创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态领域抽象的选择会影响智能体的规划、推理和解释能力，因此需要一种有效的方法来生成与特定目标对齐的抽象表示。

Method: 在PDDL中建模智能体具体行为，利用大型语言模型的上下文学习能力，根据自然语言指定的抽象目标生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例。

Result: GPT-4o在简单设置下通常能合成有用的规划领域抽象，但在动作抽象方面表现优于关联谓词的抽象。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在生成规划领域抽象方面具有潜力，特别是在动作抽象方面，但在谓词抽象方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类移动性预测模型要么只建模位置序列，要么仅将时间信息作为辅助输入，未能充分利用兴趣点(POI)提供的丰富语义上下文。

Method: 提出STaBERT模型，在BERT-based移动性模型基础上，加入推导的时间描述符和POI嵌入，在每个位置整合POI和时间信息，构建统一的语义增强移动性表示。

Result: 实验结果显示STaBERT显著提升预测准确性：单城市预测的GEO-BLEU分数从0.34提升到0.75；多城市预测从0.34提升到0.56。

Conclusion: 整合POI语义信息和时间描述符能够有效提升人类移动性预测性能，STaBERT模型在单城市和多城市预测任务中都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EQA方法直接使用VLM探索环境而不进行显式思考或规划，限制了推理能力，导致过度或低效探索以及无效回答。

Method: 提出ToolEQA代理，集成外部工具进行多步推理；设计自动生成EQA任务的数据管道，构建包含18K任务的EQA-RT数据集。

Result: 在EQA-RT-Seen和EQA-RT-Unseen上，ToolEQA比最先进基线成功率提高9.2~20.2%，比零样本ToolEQA高10%；在HM-EQA、OpenEQA和EXPRESS-Bench上也达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ToolEQA通过工具集成和多步推理显著提升了EQA任务的性能，展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医疗保健领域具有巨大潜力，但由于训练数据的质量和公平性问题，AI解决方案在实际临床实践中的应用仍然有限。数据收集过程中的偏见是主要障碍之一。

Method: 基于西班牙国家研发计划中的AI4HealthyAging项目，研究人员在检测临床数据收集过程中的偏见时，识别了多种偏见类型，包括历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见。

Result: 研究发现偏见在多个用例中普遍存在，体现在性别、年龄、居住环境、社会经济地位、设备和标签等多个变量上。这些偏见影响了AI系统的公平性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了改善临床问题设计和数据收集公平性和鲁棒性的实用建议，希望这些发现和经验能为未来开发更公平的医疗AI系统提供指导。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI系统在战场中作用日益重要的时代，确保负责任的目标打击需要对潜在附带效应进行严格评估。

Method: 采用设计科学方法论，构建统一的知识表示与推理架构，整合时间、空间和力量维度，包含分层结构捕获AI系统类别、架构组件、打击向量和上下文方面，同时考虑传播、严重性、可能性和评估指标。

Result: 模型通过实例化进行了演示和评估，为构建负责任和可信赖的智能系统奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该模型为评估军事行动中打击AI系统产生的效应提供了透明推理机制，有助于构建负责任和可信赖的智能系统。

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

### [140] [LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction: A survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20345)
*Haonan Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该调查系统回顾了大型语言模型赋能知识图谱构建的最新进展，分析了LLM如何重塑本体工程、知识提取和知识融合这三个传统知识图谱构建流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的出现，知识图谱构建正从基于规则和统计的流程转向语言驱动和生成式框架，需要系统梳理这一范式转变。

Method: 从基于模式和无模式两个互补视角，回顾新兴的LLM驱动方法，分析代表性框架的技术机制和局限性。

Result: 系统分析了LLM如何重塑知识图谱构建的三个层次流程，识别了不同范式的优缺点。

Conclusion: 明确了LLM与知识图谱之间不断发展的相互作用，旨在弥合符号知识工程和神经语义理解，开发自适应、可解释和智能的知识系统。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

### [141] [IKnow: Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Pretraining for Effective Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20377)
*Tianyi Zhang,Florian Mai,Lucie Flek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了IKnow框架，通过指令-响应对话格式的自监督目标，在无需外部资源的情况下实现语言模型的持续预训练，避免指令跟随能力退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续预训练方法需要原始基础模型或外部领域数据库，这在基础模型权重因安全原因被保留或可靠外部语料不可用时存在现实障碍。

Method: IKnow框架在指令-响应对话格式中制定新颖的自监督目标，利用文本中嵌入的领域知识并在更深语义层面进行编码。

Result: 该方法能够在不依赖外部资源的情况下适应新领域，同时保持模型的指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: IKnow提供了一个简单通用的框架，解决了持续预训练中指令跟随能力退化和语义表示退化的问题。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于创造力理论的计算模型，用于生成更具新颖性的创新机会，在酒店业创新项目中验证了其优于Notebook LM和ChatGPT4o的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的创新机会生成方法在保持实用性的同时难以产生足够新颖的想法，需要结合创造力理论开发更有效的计算模型。

Method: 开发了包含五个功能模块的计算模型，这些功能旨在在不损失实用性的前提下提高创新机会的新颖性。

Result: 在酒店业创新项目中的评估显示，该模型生成的结果比Notebook LM和ChatGPT4o更具新颖性和/或实用性，但并非所有功能模块都对提高新颖性有贡献。

Conclusion: 该计算模型在生成新颖创新机会方面表现优异，但部分功能需要进一步优化，为模型开发提供了新的方向。

Abstract: This paper presents a new computational model of creative outcomes, informed
by creativity theories and techniques, which was implemented to generate more
novel opportunities for innovation projects. The model implemented five
functions that were developed to contribute to the generation of innovation
opportunities with higher novelty without loss of usefulness. The model was
evaluated using opportunities generated for an innovation project in the
hospitality sector. The evaluation revealed that the computational model
generated outcomes that were more novel and/or useful than outcomes from
Notebook LM and ChatGPT4o. However, not all model functions contributed to the
generation of more novel opportunities, leading to new directions for further
model development

### [143] [Neural Reasoning for Robust Instance Retrieval in $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20457)
*Louis Mozart Kamdem Teyou,Luke Friedrichs,N'Dah Jean Kouagou,Caglar Demir,Yasir Mahmood,Stefan Heindorf,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EBR的神经推理器，使用嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，解决了传统描述逻辑推理器对不一致和错误数据不鲁棒的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号概念学习方法依赖描述逻辑推理器，但这些推理器对知识库中的不一致和错误数据不鲁棒，限制了在实际知识库中的部署。

Method: EBR推理器利用嵌入来近似符号推理结果，仅需检索原子概念和存在限制的实例，就能近似SHOIQ描述逻辑中任何概念的实例集。

Result: 实验表明EBR在缺失和错误数据情况下比现有推理器更鲁棒，能够有效处理现实知识库中的不完整性。

Conclusion: EBR为神经符号概念学习提供了一种鲁棒的推理方法，解决了传统符号推理器在现实知识库部署中的局限性。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

*Yiwen Peng,Thomas Bonald,Fabian M. Suchanek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FLORA是一种基于模糊逻辑的无监督知识图谱对齐方法，无需训练数据，可同时对齐实体和关系，提供可解释的结果，并在主要基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱对齐方法主要关注纯实体级对齐，在嵌入空间中计算实体相似度，缺乏可解释的推理且需要训练数据。

Method: 基于模糊逻辑的迭代方法，提供实体和关系的整体对齐，允许悬空实体，并具有可证明的收敛性。

Result: 在主要基准测试中实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种简单而有效的无监督知识图谱对齐方法，具有可解释性、收敛性和处理悬空实体的能力。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

### [145] [Lost in Translation: Policymakers are not really listening to Citizen Concerns about AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20568)
*Susan Ariel Aaronson,Michael Moreno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究比较了澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和美国三个国家在AI治理中的公众参与情况，发现政府未能建立有效的对话机制，参与率低于1%，且官员对反馈的响应有限，导致参与式AI治理的承诺与实践之间存在差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众对AI有强烈意见并希望政策制定者倾听，但政府在将公众意见转化为政策时存在信息丢失问题，错失了建立AI信任的关键机会。

Method: 采用景观分析方法，研究三个国家（澳大利亚、哥伦比亚、美国）如何征集公众对AI风险和政策的反馈，以及这些意见是否影响了治理。

Result: 在三个案例中，公民和政策制定者都未能建立有意义的对话。政府缺乏吸引多样化声音的努力，参与率极低（<1%），官员对反馈的响应有限，未能形成有效的反馈循环。

Conclusion: 当前方法不太可能建立AI的信任或合法性，因为政策制定者未能充分倾听和回应公众关切。作者提出了八项改进建议，包括促进AI素养、监控公众反馈、扩大宣传范围、使用创新参与方法等。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

*Ali Rajaei,Peter Palensky,Jochen L. Cremer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种图神经网络加速方法，用于解决电网拓扑优化问题，实现大规模系统的近实时优化，具有拓扑和跨系统泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法在近实时内解决大规模电网的混合整数非线性拓扑优化问题，机器学习方法泛化能力有限，限制了实际应用。

Method: 开发异构边感知消息传递神经网络，预测有效的母线分裂动作作为候选拓扑优化解，考虑线性化交流潮流模型。

Result: 在GOC 2000节点系统上实现4个数量级的加速，1分钟内提供交流可行解，最优性差距为2.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现大规模系统近实时拓扑优化迈出了重要一步，具有拓扑变化和跨系统泛化能力。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

*Heejin Do,Jaehui Hwang,Dongyoon Han,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出因果逐步评估(CaSE)方法，将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，通过仅使用前文评估每个推理步骤来避免后见偏差，证明这种方法能有效提升最终任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统仅评估最终答案正确性的方法过于粗糙，无法反映底层推理过程的质量，限制了模型改进的有效性。需要更细粒度的推理评估来构建更鲁棒的模型。

Method: 将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，提出CaSE评估方法，仅使用前文内容评估每个推理步骤，避免后见偏差。创建了MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH专家标注基准进行验证。

Result: CaSE方法与人类判断一致，使用CaSE评估的相关性和连贯性数据筛选训练数据能直接提升最终任务性能。

Conclusion: CaSE提供了一个可扩展的框架，用于分析、调试和改进LLM推理，证明了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

TL;DR: 提出了两种可扩展的随机游走中心性算法，在近线性时间内计算节点重要性，适用于大规模网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走中心性能够捕捉丰富的图结构信息，但在大规模网络上计算现有方法计算成本过高，不实用。

Method: 1. 基于近似Cholesky分解和稀疏逆估计的算法；2. 基于根生成树采样的算法。两种算法都提供强近似保证。

Result: 在大型真实网络（包括超过1000万节点的网络）上的实验证明了所提算法的高效性和近似质量。

Conclusion: 提出的两种算法能够在近线性时间内有效计算随机游走中心性，解决了大规模网络计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可解释性设计模型对于在现实应用中建立对自动化决策模型的信任、问责和安全采用至关重要。

Method: 形式化定义了监督学习设置，涵盖表格数据、时间序列、图像、文本、交易和轨迹等多种数据类型。分析了特征重要性、规则和实例三类主要可解释模型家族的可解释性维度、推理机制和复杂性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模型生成过程中评估伦理度量，为开发可信赖的AI系统奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

TL;DR: 提出了EcomEval，一个全面的多语言多模态基准测试，用于评估LLM在电子商务领域的表现，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务评估方法存在任务多样性有限、模态单一、数据合成化、语言覆盖窄等问题，缺乏评估复杂真实购物场景的可靠工具。

Method: 构建包含6大类37个任务（含8个多模态任务）的基准测试，数据主要来自真实客户查询和交易日志，采用半自动流程生成参考答案，由50多名专家审核修改。

Result: EcomEval覆盖7种语言（包括5种东南亚低资源语言），定义了任务难度级别，支持挑战导向的细粒度评估。

Conclusion: EcomEval为电子商务领域的LLM评估提供了更全面、真实和多样化的基准测试工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Motivation: 需要量化模型在动态扩展环境中的适应能力，区分封闭式和开放式基准测试，重点关注现实世界的闭环开放式基准。

Method: 通过测量模型对扩展环境中状态变化的理解、预测和调整能力来评估适应性，强调二阶适应性以实现自持计算。

Result: 建立了量化模型适应性的评估框架，提出了FI指标来衡量模型在动态环境中的表现。

Conclusion: 真正超级智能的模型应具备至少二阶适应性，通过数字补充实现自持计算以达到最佳流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)
models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within
rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains
fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational
architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI
paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature
on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities

TL;DR: 提出基于拓扑数据分析的评估框架，用于自动评估大语言模型推理轨迹的质量，相比传统图指标具有更高预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型推理轨迹质量的方法依赖专家标注，劳动密集且不可靠，需要自动化、高效的评估方案。

Method: 采用拓扑数据分析方法捕捉推理轨迹的几何结构，提取紧凑稳定的拓扑特征来评估推理质量。

Result: 拓扑特征在评估推理质量方面比标准图指标具有显著更高的预测能力，表明有效推理更适合用高维几何结构描述。

Conclusion: 拓扑特征为推理质量提供了可靠指标，可作为未来强化学习算法的实用信号，实现标签高效的自动评估。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Graph-RFT是一个两阶段强化微调KGQA框架，通过'计划-KG搜索-网络搜索-思考'范式，使LLM能够在知识不完整条件下自主规划和跨知识图谱与网络源的自适应检索调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA方法难以充分利用知识图谱的丰富知识和LLM的推理能力，特别是在复杂场景下。它们通常假设知识图谱覆盖完整，缺乏判断何时需要外部信息的机制，且推理过程局部短视，无法保持连贯的多步规划。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）使用链式思维微调方法和定制化计划-检索数据集激活结构化推理；2）引入计划检索引导的强化学习过程，集成显式规划和检索动作，采用笛卡尔式规划模块分解复杂问题，使用逻辑表达式指导工具调用。

Result: 该方法通过多奖励设计（结合结果和检索特定信号）优化推理检索过程，使模型能够学习何时以及如何有效结合KG和网络检索。

Conclusion: Graph-RFT框架解决了GRPO冷启动问题，实现了覆盖感知的检索调度和全局一致的多步推理，在知识不完整条件下提升了KGQA性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AGI定义基于认知领域的算术平均，假设可补偿性（某些领域的卓越能力可以弥补其他领域的失败），但真正的通用智能应该反映所有基本领域的平衡能力。

Method: 提出基于广义均值在补偿性指数连续统上的积分的AGI度量方法，涵盖算术、几何和调和均值体系，通过曲线下面积（AUC）量化不同补偿性假设下的鲁棒性。

Result: 应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的CHC领域得分，一致性调整的AUC显示尽管算术得分很高（如GPT-5达到24%），但两个系统距离通用能力仍然很远。

Conclusion: 整合广义均值提供了一个原则性、可解释且更严格的AGI进展测量基础，能够更好地评估真正的通用智能进展。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over
10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to
stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and
the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this
challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable
of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.
